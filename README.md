# Deep Learning Bootcamp Resources

## Tutorial 1: Introduction to ML with SciKit Learn
Slides: [ML with Python](Tutorial1_Slides-ML_in_Python.pdf)

In this lab we will use the [main tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial1_Introduction_to_Python_and_Sklearn.ipynb) for sentiment analysis, as well as the [secondary tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial1_NLI_Exercise.ipynb) on natural language inference (time permitting). 

If stuck see the [main tutorial solutions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial1_Introduction_to_Python_and_Sklearn_answers.ipynb).


## Tutorial 2: Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch
Slides: [PyTorch](Tutorial2_Slides-PyTorch.pdf)

We'll continue our sentiment analysis project with [deep learning methods](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial2_deeplearning_intro.ipynb).

## Tutorial 3: NLP Tutorial 
In this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial3_advanced_pytorch_tutorial.ipynb), we'll continue working on sentiment analysis and introduce RNNs and CNNs. 

## Tutorial 4: Computer Vision Tutorial
In this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial4_advanced_vision_tutorial_2020.ipynb), we'll build neural networks for image-classification and utilize state of the art models.

## Tutorial 5: Neural Networks for Chemistry
In this [tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pgmikhael/mit_deeplearning_bootcamp/blob/master/Tutorial5_property_prediction_tutorial.ipynb), we'll build neural networks to encode molecules and predict various chemical properties.
