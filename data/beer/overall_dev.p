S"pours out a dark clear red amber with a nice tan head thats dropping by the second . smell . very malty aroma with a very small scent of an alcoholic apple . also has a bit of a cinnoman smell . taste . not bad , sweeter than the aroma would have suggested . a very mellow flavor , very mild . a nice maltiness to it , but seems like it has that massed-produced flavor- i hoping there arent adjunts to it , but i wouldnt be surprised . but i do get a small hop taste to it , like a cascade taste to it , which seems very interesting . mouthfeel is good . nice medium body , good balance . has a nice creaminess to it . overall , it 's not great for its style , but for the price i 'd say its quite good . if it was available around here , i could see buying this in a pinch more often than not ."

S'presentation - 250 ml bottle / 2007 no q51558 edition appearance - opaque dark brown color and unfortunately with none head . smell - complex blend of ripe and dried fruits , toffee and treacle . taste - sweet malt character is predominant ( too sweet ) , with lots of dried fruits and an unpleasant yeasty back . mouthfeel - none carbonation but a nice full body ( chewy ) . drinkability - a beer to be drinked once . note - im not sure if none carbonation is a characteristic of this beer . maybe this specific bottle had some problem .'

S"bottle acquired through trade with jchow79 and poured into standard curved shaker pint glass . a : pours a very deep orange , almost *brown* ... very dark for an ipa . frothy off-white head , about 1 finger in size , sits on top . s : very malty-sweet and earthy , with a mild scent of pine hops . t : earthy flavors and the taste of sweet-and-sour sugars that i find to be so prevalent in east coast ipas . some pine bitterness on the back end . for me , the sugars are just overpowering . what i want out my ipa is lots of hops . bitter hops , oily grapefruit presence , citrus hops , ect . this beer just does n't have much of any of that . m : reasonably good carbonation and lots of tongue coating with the sugars and hops . d : this is n't my kind of ipa . just not enough bitterness or grapefruit hops in them for my liking . this beer reminds me a lot of a dogfish ipa , particularly 90 minute . a lot of my friends love dogfish 90 . i 'd recommend this beer to any of them . but much like dogfish 90 ( and most east coast ipas , for that matter ) , this one just is n't for me ."

S'nice light amber color with a full , white head that recedes to only a minimal lacing within about 5 minutes . alcohol in the nose , with strong , pungent hops , some cinammon and nutmeg spiciness as well . taste is quite dry , with a leafy hoppiness , slight earthy and bready taste , and some definite yeast character . not much spiciness in the taste , as compared to the smell , nice malt/hop balance going on and some alcohol in the aftertaste . very light , watery mouthfeel with minimal carbonation . drinkability is quite high due to the overall light nature of this brew , the alcohol seems a bit overpowering at times though . interesting beer overall , nice change of pace considering the other winter concoctions out there .'

S"i 've historically not been a big fan of ipa 's , but i would definately purchase this brew again . nice amber color with good head retention and lacing . strong clean hops aroma . this bitterness is well balanced , and although the hops lingers a bit , the aftertaste is very clean . considering abv and the strength of hops , i consider this beer very drinkable for this style . i find it difficult to find an ipa i can drink at all , let alone one that makes me reconsider my opinion of the style completely . this beer is worth your time ."

S'into a sample glass at the brewery , it poured a transparent golden hue with two fingers of white head , that laced very well . the aroma was of melon , apricot , and nuts ; surprising mix , but it worked . the taste started fruity , dissolved to a hint of nutty maltiness , and then finished super-dry . a high level of carbonation combined with a light body spelled a very good session beer .'

S"nitro bottle purchased at total wine in alexandria . glad to have that zero taken out of my profile . only one to go now . served in a hill farmstead wine glass . the pour is nearly a thing of beauty . the nitro pellet really does its job . body is pitch black . the head is just barely off white and skies up a few fingers with good retention and quite a bit of lacing . each swirl creates three layers -- black up to a mix of brownish-black bubbles and then the white head . really pretty . from there , downhill . the nose brings some very light chocolate and roasted malt . it 's hiding in the background . some light toffee as well . the flavor is a bit unappetizing . there 's too much toffee and not enough roast . the creaminess further enhances the toffee flavor . i think there 's probably a touch of diacetyl in there , but not too much . mild roast that really does n't come through until the finish , which is too dry . not a big fan of this one , other than looking at it ."

S"this poured pretty nice out the bomber bottle , and was a dark amber brown color . the first thing that hits you is a bitter grapefruit taste . this lingers and lingers and envelopes upon sip after sip and is bitter and never complex or sweet . there is no real true malt that can be distinguished , because of the bitterness . admittedly i am not the biggest fan of hoppy beers , but this is pretty crazy . there is a distinct lack of balance . when you drink a saison you can get sour and sweet , or a well crafted ipa you get intense bitterness and sweet or malt or heft to balance but not . here . oh yeah ; i read the bottle ; i have tried numerous beers from all over the world , and i would n't rank this one very highly , or as outstanding , despite the bottle . it may be an unpopular opinion , but this beer is a bit of smoke and mirrors i am afraid , or is it emperors new clothes ?"

S"poured into a standard pint glass . a - pours to a high , foamy head . gold-to-amber gradient looking down the tilted glass . s - very pleasant . fruity , more of the acidic variety -- roma tomato , rotting orange ( but in a good way ) , persimmon maybe , sweet red pepper , a little raspberry which could just be my imagination . floral smell too . t - slightly more bitter than i 'd hoped but a nice flavor -- raspberry , must , a hint of shallot that passes up through the sinuses , just a tiny bit of sweetness that lags behind the bitter . m - causes the lips to purse most similar to eating a grapefruit . it feels too thin for my liking . i almost ca n't feel it swish around my mouth , and there 's too much of a carbonated tingle going down the throat . d - very drinkable beer . other than the bitterness , there 's nothing that 's likely to turn anyone off about it . very light for an ale , a good choice for a full stomach if you 're looking for something with a little bite but do n't have a taste for sweet . this would go great with roasted peppers , cabbage , broccoli , endive salad ... stuff like that ."

S"i have been a brewer for years and love farmhouse style ales . that is exactly what this beer is to me . i first had it in wisconsin on business and have made a few trips back across the border to stock up since ! color is a cloudy medium straw thanks to all the healthy yeast in the drink . head starts out dense and creamy but quickly dissipates . not much lacing noticed . flavor is light but complex . starts out like a nice medium bodied ale , then some hop bitterness , then it finishes sweet with hints of fruity bubble gum-like esters dancing on the middle of my tongue . it has a hidden strength that catches up with you . the beer is so drinkable it 's pretty easy to have that extra one or two ! and that 's a good thing !"

S"it 's on the reddish side of brown , poured from a 12 oz . bottle into an imperial pint glass and the hard pour takes the head to the brim . it dissipates fairly quickly but leaves some nice lacing around the edge and a creamy layer on top of the beer . it has a really delicious smell to it , like molasses and toffee and a little roasted note . that 's appetizing ! smells a little boozy too , i guess at 6.7 % it 's a little strong for the style and it comes through a little . the roasted notes come through more in the taste ... it 's a little thin though . i like the sweet malt flavor on the tip of the tongue as a compliment to the roasted flavors at the end . super easy to drink ... just a little thin on the mouthfeel ."

S"bottled in '05 pours pitch black with a thin , creamy head that is well-retained considering the high abv . the smell is of sweetened dark fruits - prunes and raisins especially - with chocolate and espresso . alcohol notes rise to give it a warming effect - almost covering some of the flavor , but held in check . a powerful , rich aroma . very very malty . sweet dark fruits and grain ( the label says `` a ridiculous amount of barley '' - it 's true . sweet chocolate and coffee notes along with caramel mix in . very complex . if you 're looking for hops - well , look elsewhere - minimal here - if at all . a powerful spicy , sharp alcohol presence makes itself well-known , especially in the finish . alcohol is certainly noticeable in the feel . in fact , to me - it almost wiped away the aftertaste for a moment . it is creamy and rich , though sharp . certainly a `` sipper '' - and a slow one at that . it does taste good and is powerful . my main issue with it is that the alcohol presence is more than it needs to be , imo . i enjoyed other high alcohol beers ( and some i did n't ) , but this one almost wrecked what is a delicious brew . still in all , it 's amazing . is it worth $ 9 ? well , to try once ( and maybe once more with a friend or two ) - certainly . but , even if i had a ton of money - which i do n't - i do n't know that i would by this often at all - it pushes the envelop with over-the-top . glad i got to try it though ! - had an enjoyable almost two hours with it !"

S'had this on tap at the old dominion brewpub is ashburn virginia . this appeared a cloudy golden yellow with a good sized rocky off white head . great head retention as a half-inch of head was still left in the glass after all the beer was consumed . the aroma was of a pleasant floral and citric hop scent that was not too strong or too weak but just right . the taste was crisp clean hoppy goodness with the citric standing at the forefront and slight earthy notes in it as well . malt didnt play a big a part in the flavor as it did in balancing this out . mouthfeel was creamy with a medium body and this went down very smooth . definitely on of my favorite non-seasonal beers that the brew pub offers .'

S"i bought this one on a whim . i was mostly enticed by the 13 % alcohol label . poured into a deep , wide wine glass . appearance : pours a medium amber with minimal head . when held up to the light there is a faint reddish color that i detect . there is a thin layer of foam on the top of my glass . this beer leaves a strong amount of lacing on the edges of the glass . carbonation seems to be light . smell : i was able to smell this the minute i opened the bottle . the dominating characteristic is , of course , the alcohol itself . there is also a faint , musty scent of fruit , although it 's hard to detect . the nose also has a spice-like characteristic , leading one to anticipate a strong flavor . taste : the beer leaves a strong impression . it starts off intensely sweet , to the point that it 's like a syrup . this leads into fruit taste , somewhere between a grapefruit and a banana . the finish is spicy and somewhat explosive , which leaves a lingering aftertaste . the common characteristic throughout a quaff is the strong alcoholic character of this brew . it dominates a bit too much , unfortunately . although there is a lot going on here , it 's rather unbalanced . mouthfeel : somewhat thick , syrupy , and lightly carbonated . this feels like it leaves some residue behind , as the aftertaste just does not go away . drinkability : this is low , for a few reasons . first , the 13 % makes multiple bottles a dangerous proposition . second , the syrupy sweet taste mixed with the alcohol taste will not sit well with the stomach in large quantities . third , the brew itself is expensive . this reminds me of another brew i bought a case of about two years ago . it was strong , and it took forever for me to finish all the bottles . the novelty of having a high alcohol content is nice , but i 've yet to find a balanced brew that pushes past the 10 % barrier ."

S"1995 vintage , drunk fall 2003 . served in a snifter . the beer is a deep amber red , a thin collar of foam bordering a couple large patches of mist . great clarity , pretty much perfectly transparent . the head thins down to a weak collar , leaving large cobwebs of lace trailing down the glass . the aroma is incredibly smooth , refined with age . all the aromas seem to melt together , with the hops very much diminished , allowing the subtle nuances of the malt to shine . extremely smoothed out , with a thick , caramelly maltiness dominating . the alcohol is still present , although much diminished , a vinous character acquired with the 8 years or so of aging . the malt is glazed with a soft nuttiness , hinting at both almond and pecan . a brush of fruitiness lingers , weaving in and out of the vinous texture . still plenty of prune , with hints of black cherry and currant having been acquired in the cellar . the hops have receded quite a bit , a resiny pine scent trembling with old age , although still retaining the virile , youthful strength of it 's once strong grip . the flavor has changed so much , starting with a huge , syrupy malt sweetness . heaps of burnt caramel , maybe a bit of peat buried below , with a heavy vinous touch . mellowed , sun baked prune eases it 's way in , hints of apple and plum very diminshed , replaced by red grape , black cherry , currant and fig . the fruitiness lingers through the sip , carried by the vinous character of the malt . the finish is still hoppy , although it 's subdued enough to allow the malt it 's moment , finally . sappy pine and earthy herbal flavor melds with a soft almond nuttiness , with a stooped brush of alcohol creating a heating blanket of warmth going down . a rich , fruity , vinous maltiness lingers on the tongue long after the last sip is downed . the body is thick and sticky , a much mellowed , soft carbonation rocking it along the palate . the mouthfeel is incredibly smooth , acquiring an aged port-ness in it 's body and feel . still a powerful brew , even in it 's old age . i was very fortunate to catch this on tap , which the folks at rogue brought so graciously for their tasting at my local . the fresh version is inspired , but this is sublime . like a talented young artist with a brilliant career , creating his finest masterpiece in the autumn of life . quite a brew with enough age on it , worth hanging onto a couple bottles for this kind of experience ."

S"um , i 'm not really sure about the a- this thing gets . appearance is clear gold with a tiny foamy head . aroma is of hops ( noble ones , apparently ! ) , citrus are the ones i get the most . not really a strong hop scent taste is hoppy with a decent malty balance , obviously neither the hops or the malts overpower anything ( its not an ipa ) , and the mouthfeel is on the lighter side . but the mild profile is n't really a `` soft '' interpretation of the pilsner style . its not that its supposed to be this weak . its just bland . drinkability is fine , but i mean..its just a boring beer . i 've had much better pilsners"

S"brown 33ml bottle given to me by my wife after a shopping trip to birmingham ( england ) . best before 26 aug 09 , drank 13 jun 09 , poured into a hougaerdse das branded tumbler . orange hue to it , a true amber colour i suppose , very little head though . left the sediment in the bottle , so the body of the beer was clear and you could see the bubbles rising through to the top and settling . what head there was produced lacing as i drank down the glass . my nose is n't what it used to be , or this beer had very little aroma . some yeast hints and maybe hops too , but not much of either . spritzy feel and taste to it , not overly hopped , but the hops were the driving force in the taste stakes . had i been given it in a blind tasting i would have said it was n't the finished article , not fully fermented , green . however that is the style this brewery likes to produce and it makes a pleasnt change to have something like this now and again . the 5.2 % abv suits it , and sits happily within the effervescence of the beer . not sure i could drink a lot of these in a row , a bit gassy for a session beer and i ca n't help thinking it is going to carry on fermenting inside me ."

S"appearance : poured in a brooklyn tulip , amber in color , a small amount of head that dissipates quickly , some lacing , some carbonation rising to the surface here and then . smell : left something to be desired , just smelled like a maltier version of their lager with a little bit of sweeter malts that i cant really place . taste : honestly it just tasted like their lager which is understandable but with some very subtle differences . there was an odd sweetness that can only be described as candy neckless or some other nondescript hard candy . mouthfeel : again nothing special just like their lager . drinkability : very drinkable . it would be nice to have on hand when the boys come over for football if you wan na throw a sixer or more back in a three hour sitting that no one would turn their nose up at . over all very bland granted it was my first of the style , but i just expected more . more malt , more something . not the rare fall treat i was expecting like i got from the pumpkin ales i 've had . maybe i should stick to those . i will of coarse try more marzens for safe measure . its a good beer that would be a good stand by case of garage suds , or a fall keg that everyone can agree on but nothing to write home about ."

S"not my favorite amber ale , but still had a decent taste and went down rather smoothly . a little disappointed when i first tried it , but ca n't really complain about the price vs. quality . have had amber ales that i paid 12 bux for a six-pack that was just flat out awful . bud american ale has a pretty reasonable price and a good taste compared to others ."

S"batch 7238 ( if memory serves ; definitely from early 2006 ) into a pint glass . thanks , matt , for sharing ! a : clear reddish-brown body with a finger of creamy tan head . nice . s : rich , smooth aroma of caramel , sherry , chocolate , toffee , and general deliciousness . t : deeply complex flavors of toffee , brown sugar , raisins , leather , spice , and fruity booze . wow . m : smooth full body with good , soft carbonation . great . d : a little hotter than i expected from a nearly 5-year old beer , but still a solidly drinkable old ale . notes : i really enjoyed this beer the only other time i tried it ( fresh from the brewery , in a single ) , so i was really excited to get to try a bottle with a few years on it . it did not disappoint . the depth and complexity of flavors was really top-notch , although it was still drinking pretty hot . i sampled it immediately after an 08 north coast old stock , and even though that beer was both younger and stronger it was still a bit less alcoholic tasting . all quibbles aside , though , this is a magnificent beer that ages gracefully . i 'll have to pick up a six-pack the next time i 'm in bell 's distribution area . cheers !"

S"wow . i do n't love wheats by any stretch . but this is a grand looking beer , with even displacement of the sediment . nice bright orange yellow color and a frisky white head that remains for lacing . orangey , cirtusy scent right up front . yeasts come through after that . slightly yeasty and citrus flavors initially . the hop flavor is balanced and smooth n the posttaste . mild bitterness at the end . very light feel , with a needless sense of macro lager type carbonation . easy to drink , really delicious for the style an expressive of the summer beer that fills your mouth with an easy time ."

S"i bought this as a single from world market in shortpump/richmond , va. - poured into dfh snifter this beer poured beautiful straw with a hint of amber but mostly golden . it was perfectly filtered , wonderful clarity with a decent head . there was n't much going on with the whiff.. it smelled like an ipa but it was n't boom smelly good.. if that makes any sense it tasted kind of like it smelled ( can you imagine that ! ? ) .. it was wonderful to drink , it just was n't bursting with flavor and did n't have the hoptastic ba boom i wanted felt great and was very drinkable , i loved going through this one but the smell and flavor was n't much to write home about.. very nice ipa for the moderate hoppers out there"

S"is this an ale or a lager ? the label says `` beer '' and the only color comes from the infused pepper , so there 's the answer . i pour this bottle into a pint glass , and plop ! what the hell was that ? there 's a vegetable in my beer , and i did not expect it at all ! must have hidden behind the label . i plucked it out with my fingers , for i ca n't stand that sad , wet legume sitting at the bottom of my glass , and getting in my lips as i try to drink ! color is reddish , but clear , head is instantaneously gone . aroma ? hot , spicy , intense chili flavor . taste ? hot , intense chili flavor . body is light , texture , there is none , no particular flvor here at all , except that given by the pepper , and that is simply too much and not enough . rogue 's mexicali is a wiser approach , using an ale as base , and without so overwhelming a peppery component . these guys use an incredibly bland lager for base , and while the result is `` crazy '' , to be sure , it does n't taste very good . i poured this one out , not because i could n't finish it , but because i lost interest ."

S"sampled october 2009 a solid pour into my large tripel karmeliet glass produces a three finger thick , lightly amber tinged , tan colored head . the beer is a concentrated , burnt amber color that shows a lightly hazed , deep plum red color when held up to the light . the aroma is not anywhere near the sweetness i was expecting . my second smell of this though has me noticing lots of rich fruit aromatics that definitely have some sweetness to them . notes of raisins and figs are quite prominent and there is a touch of hot alcohol towards the finish . a rich maltiness mixes with the dark fruit , contributing a deeply caramelized malt sugar note as well as some subtle toasted grain character towards the end . a touch of aromatics that make me think of freshly fermenting plums . further inspection yields ample spicy clove notes , a touch of white pepper , some woody allspice , . at times the beer comes off as being savory , despite the fruity and sweet spice notes . this definitely has a complex , well integrated nose ; one that is clearly world class . somewhat sweet tasting , though not overly so , the palate is immediately engulfed by a rich fruitiness that is only slightly wiped clean in the finish by some hot alcohol spiciness . fruity , with a rich sweetness and even a savory malt backbone , this beer has a lot of things going on . there is quite a bit of spice character here , though it is not more than soft and is definitely well integrated ; some lightly tongue numbing clove , an allspice note , some woody black pepper and an almost oaky spiciness ( it has a definite woodiness to it somehow ) . for some reason the flavor is n't as impressive as the aroma , though this is still quite good . while this is rich and somewhat thick , the beer is not overly heavy ; despite its strength it has a certain drinkability that is requisite of the style . this is a pretty nice beer , the biggest flaw is that the alcohol can be a bit too noticeable at times ; it does n't ruin the beer for me though . interesting , this might be quite phenomenal if not for the hot alcohol ; i wish i had bought a second bottle to age a bit longer ."

S'had this from a mini-keg that my friend just tapped open ( although i have of course tried this many times before ) appearance : pours out a golden yellow w/ little to no head that quickly dissipates . smell : very faint smell of hops ? nothing really here folks taste : after having just had some nice chimay reserve ( blue ) i proceeded to try and slow down my drinking and poured myself some coors my friend brought over . it taste like ... water . water w/ a touch of tang . mouthfeel : light ... thin ... like water drinkability : i could drink this all day long because of how weak it is and how it has no real flavour ... but would i want to ? if the makers of this beer wanted a drink people could drink all day w/ out feeling the effects of the alcohol or a drink that has no flavour to more traditional drinks they did a damn good job'

S'appearence is a beautiful straw with a slight orange hew . smell is clean , a little sweet with fresh corn . taste is very clean . a slight straw and corn flavor . a little sweet at first but the hops give it a clean , crisp finish . the carbonation is almost perfect for this style . drinkability is great , you can drink this beer all day especially when its hot . a very refreshing and good american lager . and the fact you can find a tall 6pack for $ 4 is awesome . a good everday or session beer . a little cleaner in the bottle than in a can , and even cleaner on tap .'

S"550 ml bottle poured into a pint glass . 2007/2008 variety . 3.5 a : thick head that retains well . lacing is there , though not too much . color is a yellow amber . 3.0 s : weak bouquet . aromas that do come through are toasty and biscuity malts and grapefruit . pleasant , but not enough . 3.5 t : like the smell , the taste is also rather subtle . the main flavor is not grapefruit , but rather something very similar . i ca n't put my finger on what is different . also grainy/toasty malts only without any sweetness . dry and slightly bitter finish . 3.0 m : though many probably enjoy the amount of carbonation , i do n't simply because the taste is n't strong enough to justify such high carbonation . 2.5 d : no way i 'd want another . this is n't what i expected from a winter warmer in that it was dry as a desert in hell and the alcohol was nearly undetectable and therefore unable to `` warm '' ."

S'serving notes - cellar temp , 0.5l german glass . a - spicy and floral hops , present but not overbearing . a - nice finger and a half of head upon pour but disappears rather quickly for an ipa . clear , pale yellow in color . m - light to medium body , some sticky-slickness from the hops , light to medium carbonation . t - nice forward spicy and floral hops from the aroma . nice clean aftertaste without a lot of the bitter hop residue . malt not in flavor but present enough to balance out the beer . d - one of the cleaner ipas . this would be a good beer to introduce someone who is turned off by more assertive ipas to the style .'

S"i drank this brew chilled , poured out in a leffe goblet that i received in a gift set . color was a light to medium amber hue , with a very thin and faint head that rapidly dissipated . carbonation also appeared light . the smell was very sweet , reminiscent of a very fruity , low quality wine . white grape dominates and is overpowering , followed by a faint trace of honey . the mouthfeel was slightly slick , leaving my mouth wet , but with a bitter aftertaste and a sticky feel on the back of the throat . abv is well-hidden behind a very sweet taste of grapes . the addition of honey is particularly strong once the beer is swallowed , leaving a disgustingly bitter aftertaste that reminds me of the feeling of ingesting cough syrup . unfortunately , i felt midas touch a bit hard to finish on two seperate occassions . the sweet taste is initially pleasant , very drinkable considering the abv , but unfortunately the aftertaste is a bit too much for me to continue swallowing . i love dogfish head 's brews , but i 'm going to have to pass on this one the next time i 'm at my local store ."

S"apperance : pours an ultra dark brown-black with a poofy dark tan head of about an 1.5 '' . looks quite thick . nasty lace sticks as the beer is drank . smell : i can stand 5 feet away and smell rich black roasted malts and twinges of imperial bitterness . i 'm salivating . rich chocolate smell also . very storm kingesque with regard to smell . taste : uh oh . i might just go back to the store and clean them out of the rest of these . this is better than good . immense hop profile gives this the perfect imperial stout aftertaste and such a good signature . there is an obvious roasted barley body , good presence of chocolate , some light butterscotch , lots of molasses , coffee . very classic flavor , quite aged rogue imperial stoutesque . mouthfeel : super heavy , slick and smooth . paints a coating on your tongue , and it 's a nice memory of the beer . very sludgy and super low carbonation begins to become really bothersome towards the finish . drinkability : well , this is where it gets kind of odd . this beer goes down really slowly . it 's sort of tough to have more than one , and even that has to go slow . i feel like its almost too heavy , does n't dance on the tongue as much as it ought . it initally does n't seem like 11.5 % , but it does feel heavy and slow due to a lack in carbonation , even for an imperial stout . still excellent though , just a bit off ."

S"decided to try this one after a recommendation from one of my dear friends , tom standley . pours an impossibly dark black , with a nice solid two finger head . leaves behind thin but extensive lacing . smells deep and dark , with definite chocolate scent from both the actual chocolate and the chocolate malt . tastes a lot less chocolatey than it smells . the chocolate is very mild and there is n't a whole lot of taste at all to speak of . much more bland than i had imagined . feels very thin in the mouth . many stouts of this kind are thick and chocolatey , but this one goes down like a very light ale . there is quite a bit of carbonation on the tongue and definite hop bitterness in the aftertaste . this is a fantastically drinkable beer , especially for a double chocolate stout . very light and low in alcohol content ."

S"750ml corked & caged bottle poured into a duvel tulip , bottled in 2009 . first things first . i got this from a cooler at store , took it home and put it in my fridge , poured it out and my duvel tulip was 95 % foam , then it started foaming out of the bottle and i filled two more glasses with 95 % foam before the bottle stopped spewing foam . took off on drinkability for this because it 's a pain to have to pour three glasses of foam before i can get one glass of beer . pours a haze orange hue with a ridiculous head that starts to crater and fade after a long time . nose is brett , funk , tart , and hoppy , really crisp and well balanced . this is a bit more flat than i 'd like , but because of the crazy over-carbonation i guess it 's to be expected . it 's got a decent hop bite to it along with a very belgian yeast character that 's quite unique and tasty ."

S"this beer is extremely hard to get , but i was very fortunate to get the last one from my local beer and wine store . it definitely lives up to expectations i 've been having for months . it is black , with a dark brown head . the smell is a little misleading at first , because it almost smelt like burning plastic . that went away as i drank more . it is relatively thick , but feels smooth in the mouth and goes down with a mild bitterness . although it could stand well on its own , the gonzo is begging to be paired with a good steak dinner or a hearty bag of kettle chips . overall , very nice ."

S"another wacky brew from the folks at dogfish head . 18 % ? wow . i 've had the 120 min and the worldwide stout , so i sort of know what to expect out of this , but let 's see how it goes . the pour is a hazy orange/red color with a minimal head . to tell the truth , it 's not much to look at . smell is ... damn . i was hoping for a kuhnhenn raspberry eisbock or a frambois nose , but it 's just not here . with this bottle , at least , the fruit is in the background , and the booziness takes center stage . taste . it 's a wine . a carbonated raspberry wine . barley and hops are nowhere to be found , and unfortunately , the raspberry flavour gets lost in the mid-palate . at the start you 've got a combination of tartness and alcohol that flows into a harsh swallow and leaves my tongue with a tart berry finish . ok , i am not digging this beer . if i want a strong raspberry beer , i 'll take a kuhnhenn raspberry eisbock 95 times out of 100 over this beer ."

S"hitting a hefty 7.2 % , it 's not a lightweight , and in a 22oz bottle , you better not have plans for the evening . the bottle has a wonderfully emotive sketch of a smug demon leaning out of the print , leering at your inability to comprehend his brew . it pours a light red , becoming a medium amber in the glass . develops about a finger's-worth of head which sticks around for a few minutes , shrinking to a ring which clings to the glass all the way down . you can definitely taste the alcohol in this brew , as it adds a bit of an astringent quality to the taste , however this tends to hit at the very end of the swallow , as an aftertaste , giving you all the more reason not to stop swallowing . the initial hit is very smooth and subtle , with a definite malt presence ( with some caramel ? ) , but closely followed and neatly balanced by some pretty harsh hops . the overall taste of this ale is somewhat sweet though , which is surprising considering just how harsh it can be when sipped timidly , allowing the aftertaste to dominate . this beer was meant to be drank outright . somewhere in the middle of the taste is a background of nuts ( almonds ? ) , and maybe some raisins . all in all , the taste comes on strong and syrupy ( with a definite strength of hops ) , and fades quickly , with a hint of smoky/bitter showing up later to bite you . it 'd be hard to drink much more of this beer than the 22oz serving ( i have a hard time almost finishing the 22oz bottle ) , as the aftertaste of bitter smoke keeps growing . a definite recommended brew , but as far as the rule of `` is it worth the money '' goes , this beer stays strictly as a `` man , i really want a harsh ale tonight '' beer , as it clocks in at $ 6 for a 22oz bottle ."

S"it 's been a little while since i reviewed a beer . # 100 for my 450th review . i chose the big balloon snifter for this one . wow , does this look appetizing . first of all , this is a really dark barleywine ; it has a dark cherry wood color . awesome foam with great retention and swirl-ability . outstanding . some light smokiness in the aroma along with raisin and bright hops . hmmm . after a promising start , i just can not say that i am crazy about the flavor here . where to begin ... .it seems very lacking up front , without much malty sweetness , just a little straight-up bitter chocolate , quickly transitioning into what i can only describe as a dull bitter hop character . very bitter , and not in a very interesting way , i 'm afraid . it 's hoppy as hell , sure . yet while b-wines like bigfoot , old guardian , old ruffian and the like are all hoppy as hell , they back it up with something , imbue it with some nice malt character to play off the hops . this does n't have that . i have no doubt that there 's plenty of malt in here ... but it 's just not working for me , it 's not creating any meaningful balance . sorry . i really did n't expect to rate this so poorly . feel is fine . hell , feel is excellent . good creaminess , very good soft carbonation . i only wish i was enjoying the taste more . for me , this beer pretty much excels in all areas except actual taste . damn . i was expecting an easy overall score of 4.0+ . i have no reason at all to believe this is a bad bottle , either . it just comes off to me as bitter hop for the sake of bitter hop ... .i can find more interesting hop/malt interplay in west coast dipas , even . it does n't seem well thought-out , which i find surprising given that i 've absolutely loved every nogne o beer i 've tried ."

S"2009 bottle i 've had this beer before but this is a new review . pours a very lovely dark amber/red color with an inch-high head that falls quickly leaving behind very light lacing in the snifter . big piney hop aroma backed up by some thick , dark caramel maltiness and light licorice . flavor follows suit . intense hop bitterness overpower the dark bready , caramel malts . lots of dark rum soaked fruit with pine sap drizzled over top . this is one big beer . alcohol can be detected throughout , from nose to throat , but it 's all a part of this beer drinking experience . it 's damn tasty , but i do n't want more than one at a time . this is an excellent barleywine , and probably the standard for american barleywines . i will drink two of these and age the rest in hopes of one day doing a 10 year vertical . very good fresh , but i ca n't wait to try this one aged !"

S"got this beer in the leinenkugel 's variety pack . i had been looking forward to trying this one but was let down . the taste was like someone had taken their sunset wheat beer , but instead of the blueberry notes , they accidentally added some powdered lemonade . much too sweet for my liking ( and i though t the sunset wheat was very good , despite its sweetness ) . this tasted too little like beer and too much like lemonade . it should be added that after my first one , i decided to mix this with the berry weiss ( 50/50 ) for something a little more tolerable ."

S"had on tap at untamed steakhouse in winter park , co . it is a dark red/brown beer , with a dense but thin tan head . the smell is very intriguing . wassal and hops . definitely a winter beer . the taste is spice and hops up front , with a caramel malt back and then a hop finish . the hops are more flavoring than bittering and the beer strikes a nice hop/malt balance . the mouthfeel is silky and light , with a nice carbonation . drinkability - it does n't get much better . the balanced flavor is not too aggressive , not too bland . it 's the kind of beer you could really settle into a cold winter 's night with ."

S'the pour produced a cloudy light yellow brew with almost no head . it appears to be well carbonated by the bubbles rising up through the beer . the spice aroma seemed to overwhelm the senses , unfortunatley i could not nail down the exact spice . the taste is what really threw me , harsh wheat flavor and the spices did not seem to blend well . the mouthfeel was good , the carbonation seemed to flow nicely over the tongue , but again the flavor seemed to take away from it . while i usually like belgian wheats i will have to pass on this one .'

S"pretty standard amber-gold colour , with a thin ring of white . minimal carbonation and a vague hint of floaties that should probably be contributing a haze , but they 're just floating there in clumps . unsurprisingly , the nose is predominantly banana - but an almost artificial banana character , like banana lollies . a bit of brown-sugar sweetness as well . it smells artificial and chemicalised . far too overpowering . a vaguely cidery base on the palate , layered with sickly sweet banana character , and a vague lambic sourness . it tastes almost nothing like beer - even the most fruity lambics i 've had in the past had a vague malty resemblance . mouthfeel is clean and fresh , at least . eh . it 's sickly and pretty unpleasant to finish . it 's unique , but there 's probably a reason why there are so few banana flavoured beers out there ..."

S"a brownish amber color with a good fluffy head and good retention . the smell is excellent ; full of big hops and some pine . at first taste it showed me the big angry hop flavors i was craving and a little bit of that pine i could smell but the more i drank the more the pine came out and and became overbearing . now i do n't dislike a little pine flavor but by the end of the bottle this tasted like half beer half pine sap- yuck . i wonder if i just got a bad bottle ."

S"a - poured out of a 750ml bottle complete with wire hood into a nice thin weizen glass , this beer has turbulent bubbles amidst a cloudy gold background . has a massive fluffy head . great looking beer . s - smells of banana and cloves with of citrus smells particularly grapefruit and lemon . t - first comes the warm malty taste of fresh bread with lots of zingy citrus and tastes of lemon . it is even a little sour and sweet , making this beer reminiscent of a fizzy lemon meringue pie . m - light and refreshing with a nice cleansing zing of citrus . d - fair bit of moreishness , but i ca n't drink many white beers at a time . all the foam and yeast fills me up and soon enough makes me feel a little nauseas ."

S"25cl bottle into a snifter at glenfiddich warehouse # 68 stockholm . the beer pours a super light brown , totally clear with hints of amber , just looks watery and unappealing . total lack of head , no lacing ... aroma smells like a typical bw but with too much alcohol . caramel , alcohol , light hop finish ... the taste is super light , that 's the first thing , annoyingly so and distracting . alcohol shows through too much , light caramel and a touch of hops ... feel is bad as we mentioned , however this is super easy to drink at 9.1 % . ok and easy to drink bw but nothing to search out for . if you 're in sweden at a local place worth a shot ."

S"being born and raised in eastern pa. yuengling lager is a staple beer . in fact , it can be ordered at a bar anywhere here just by asking for a `` lager '' its brewed at the oldest brewery in the usa . i 've been drinking it for years and decided to review it . it comes in a green 12oz . bottle with an old school label . pours a beautiful bright amber with a thin white lace . has a fruity smell to and is slightly fruity to taste . its crisp and lightly sweet and thin . this is your basic lager done right . yuengling lager is a no frills lager thats great as a session beer ."

S'pours out a clear golden with some lively carbonation rising up the glass and a thin ring of settled white head . nose is really faint and light . some soft malts and spicy hops are present . taste , again , is rather tame , but is certainly stronger than the smell . light , crackery wheat mixes with pale malts and some grassy , earthy hops . i wish the flavors would be slightly stronger , but i really like the idea of a wheat lager . reminds me of a tame pilsner that is lightened up with some wheat . mouthfeel is light and refreshing with tingling bubbles . this is nice on a hot and muggy day in louisiana .'

S"sampled june 2009 a vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a four-finger thick , very lightly browned , tan colored head . the beer is a dark , concentrated , well burnt amber color that shows a brilliantly clear , bright ruby hue when held up to the light . the aroma smells thick and sweet with a ton of bright fruitiness that reminds me of raisins , and prunes . the malt is pretty big in the nose , concentrated malt notes even start to get into the savory side of the spectrum , though they predominantly are sweet . there is a brightness to the sweetness here that seems to be lacking in the rich , complex sweetness that i really like to find in a strong bock ; it is almost a bit too simple-sugar focused , more caramelization and maillard browning richness would be a welcome addition that is lacking in this beers aroma . this does n't seem to be the cleanest fermentation profile either as there seems to be some bubble-gum like aromatics here and a touch of fusel alcohols that provide a touch of warming . the aroma is actually pretty enjoyable , but it is more of a belgian interpretation of a bock . i am able to pick out notes of cotton candy , caramelize fruit notes , perhaps a hint of toasty malt and just a wisp of underlying malt richness . wow , fairly light bodied and not nearly as sweet as the aroma suggested ; this last makes it all the more apparent how un-lager like the fermentation character in this beer is , definitely not a good example of a clean lager fermentation . the beer is actually quite thin for a bock , much less a amplified doppelbock . i do like that this is n't nearly as sweet as i was dreading , the sweetness that is here is a bit simplistic and is missing that rich , concentrated malt depth that should be in a decent version of anything with bock on the label . the relative dryness does allow the toasted , dark malt character to come out a bit more . the beer finishes with a toasted , biscuit like and browned bread crust character . there seems to be a touch of phenolics here almost , though it is more like some fusel alcohol notes in the finish . the lack of overt sweetness also seems to make the fruitiness here lean towards the almost tart plum / prune side of the spectrum . i am a bit conflicted on this beer , from a stylistic standpoint this beer is a complete mess , but it is actually not half bad , especially if you think of it as a belgian interpretation of a doppelbock . in the end though the body and flavor is lacking the richness and complexity that is need to really carry this beer ."

S"lone star , much like it 's pabst stablemate pearl , is no longer brewed in san antonio at the old pearl brewery . it is now contract brewed in dallas by miller . so much like pearl , we have a beer that was never great to begin with , but now it 's lost whatever charm it might have possessed due to it 's connection with a historical brewery . maybe it 's the change in water , maybe there are other factors , but lone star has become yet another faceless , remarkably tasteless , tourist-trap brew . out-of-towners come to texas , drink this , and believe that this is all that we have to offer . sad , sad days . the dallas-brewed lone star pours like a sodapop , small head , fizzy yellow coloring . smells corny and slightly off . tastes weak and sour . it 's smooth , but that 's from a lack of flavor and character . much more malty than hoppy , it settles poorly on the tummy . overcarbonated and bland , it never lets taste get in the way of the easy , uncomplicated drinkability . lack of a distinctive finish and poor mouthfeel make this version of the lone star beer one to pass up . this irritates me . lone star was drinkable back in the day . it was n't the greatest beer ever by a long shot , but it carried the state 's nickname with some semblance of pride . no longer . tip to visitors : put the lone star down and try something else . the state of texas has plenty of better beers to offer ."

S"chilled 750ml bottle poured into a unbroue branded chalice . body is very dark with only a very fleeting glimpse of a cola he when held to the light . generated a dark tan head of about 2 fingers which fell away nicely with patchy lace and finally a generous thin layer remained . dried dark fruits dominate the nose along with a mild yeasty funk and warm dough . aromatic notes grow as the beer warms up towards room temperature . the taste profile is well characterized by the yeast and it appears as though the malt and dark fruit notes are trying to bust through across the palate however something seems a little lost in translation and instead the taste is very confusing . at first this is a little offensive and perhaps a little metallic or soapy . weighting is medium to heavy and carbonation is light . this beer is bit of an anomaly . the appearance and aroma have the goods , although the aroma is slightly thin , however the taste spectrum is extremely confusing . i have had unibroue terrible on other occasions and this is the first time i have encountered this metallic soapy taste , so perhaps there are good and bad batches . with unibroue becoming more commercial perhaps there is reason to expect they are losing that `` special touch '' that they once had ."

S"pours a light brown with a large , thick , bone-white head . aroma is sweet and sugary , fruity and yeasty with a musty , flowery cola presence . one of the more delightful noses i 've encountered in a while . taste is sweet , bready and malty . not as sweet as the aroma suggests , lots of caramel and cola flavors . hot with alcohol in both the mouthfeel and the flavors but not so much as to be off-putting . definite cough-syrup category . mouthfeel is medium but the alcohol makes it a sipper . smells nice but i would prefer a little more complexity and a little less heat . a curiosity , not a fridge staple ."

S"i ca n't believe i never got around to reviewing this , what i consider to be my `` baseline '' ipa , until now . pours a coppery orange/amber color . two inch white head . smells of pine , citrus , and maybe a hint of floral . taste is largely hops , with some sweeter citrus flavors mixed in , a bit of pine , and just a tad of malt . not nearly as malty as most dipas , or even other nearby breweries offerings ( wipeout ipa comes to mind ) . delicious , always refreshing ."

S"served with a lime ( i took it off the rim of the glass immediately , i 'm not usually the type to put fruit in it and it would be bad for a review ) . color was a solid amber that let the light shine through . little to know visible head/lacing . the beer smelled of light malts and hops ... nothing distinctive . the taste was well balanced and smooth . once again nothing extremely distinctive , but that is because of the balance . mouthfeel/drinkablility : this was a beer that was made to be easy to drink , especially with spicy food ... .worked great to wash down my burrito ."

S"it pains me to trash a beer , but this brewery needs a swift kick in the pants . i arrived in sun valley for a wedding and was eager to try the local brew . my first taste of sun valley brewing came with a six pack of white cloud ale purchased from a supermarket in ketchum , about 10 miles from hailey . neither the label nor the holder indicated what kind of beer it was . was it a white ale as the name almost implies ? was it a more generic american ale ? who knows . ( i see that on ba it 's listed as an amber ) . it poured okay and a quick sniff and sip made me wonder if i was picking up coriander , thus confirming this as a white . but upon second and subsequent sips , i realized it was just off . oxidized ? probably . infected ? way more likely . i had n't planned on reviewing it because i hoped it was just an isolated incident , but at a bar the next day in ketchum , i ordered sun valley gretchen 's gold lager and it was even more sour . for the first time in my life , i returned a beer ( luckily they had moose drool and alaskan ipa on draft ) . i could n't finish either of these sour beers ( and not like it 's brewed intentionally with brett ) . i found out that the brewmaster i 'd heard of , gordon , left around 2003 . whoever the new guy is , he needs to clean up the brewery and get back to basics with brewing ."

S'huge thanks to zachattack555 for giving this to me as an extra a few hours ago . second time having , still not impressed . pours a honey color with a little bit of white head . leaves very little lacing down the glass . smells like hops . citrus , pine , slight herbal hops with a fairly strong malt backbone to hold it up . taste is good , nice citrus and pine comes through with a substantial sweetness to back it up . it hints at honey , but nothing too major . finishes with an alcohol burn , which i believe detracts from it . mouthfeel is good . moderately full and a good amount of carbonation . drinkability is a little low . alcohol finish is just unappealing in ipas for me . did not live up to the hype for me , but not a bad beer .'

S'part of a blind tasting that included nelson , duet , and pure hoppiness . nelson was my least favorite and pure hoppiness was my favorite - an incredible beer . a - duet has a bright yellow color with a tiny bit of haziness . as a fellow ba pointed out , this beer looks like a glass of pee . poor head retention with somewhat decent lacing . s - pleasant smell - lemon soapiness , and piney hops . t - piney hops is about all i get here . a little bit of citrus hops and a little bit of malt , but not enough balance in my opinion . m - just so-so . pretty thin . d - the thinness of this beer makes it quite drinkable . the only limitation to the drinkability is the painful intensity of the pine hops that overwhelm any other flavors in the beer .'

S"i do n't know why this beer is n't lighting up the trade charts . a really fantastic , sweet barleywine balanced by alcohol and the woody bite of bourbon . what is n't to love ? just a fantastic pour . a huge head that lingers . a nice bit of lacing too . the beer is a little cloudy when it is too cold to drink , but a signal for when it the beer is warm enough to drink is ok by me ! the beer smells like toffee , cough syrup , and bourbon . the taste is really pretty fantastic . toffee , caramel , chocolate , a nice alcohol warming sensation , carob , and a hefty dose of bourbon . i mean , who can argue with that ? there is also a vague citrus to the beer from the hops , maybe ? i 'm not even sure , it could just be the alcohol . yeah , this beer is nice . in terms of a downside , the beer does have a sort of cough-syrup flavor to it . but i find that is pretty common amongst barleywines , let alone bourbon barrel aged ones . good stuff ."

S"og 16.4 plato 25 ibus 12 oz twist off bottle with an enjoy by date of january 09 , 2011 , poured into a surly pint glass . no abv information on the bottle and the abv is way out of control . appearance 4/5 pours clear , but not brightly clear , honey golden with a nice two finger creamy off white head . moderate head retention and good lacing . an inviting appearance for sure . aroma 4/5 nice toasted malt aroma with a decent amount of sweetness to it . no hops in the nose . true to style . taste 4.5/5 slightly sweet beginnings with a nice , light and soft , sweet maltiness in the middle and some balancing bitterness in the end , along with toasted flavors . finish is medium with some residual sweetness and some bitterness . the bitterness certainly helps the finish . perhaps the best tasting oktoberfest i have had . mouthfeel 4/5 carbonation is slightly higher than i would like but it 's not off putting . very attenuated and not cloying at all for a malty beer and for its og . drinkability 2/5 i am not going to an oktoberfest where people are drinking this . seriously , what were the folks at summit thinking ? as solid as the taste is , are they trying to make a supposedly session beer double as roofies ? the alcohol is way too high and the taste and mouthfeel entirely deceptive . at first i thought that the abv listed on beeradvocate might have been an error but i checked at the brewer 's website too . had it been 3.7 % abv ( 3.7 = 7.4/2 ! ) , i could have drank it for hours ! what can i say , for a non belgian beer at this body , the drinkability is below average ."

S'bottle # 06691 . a : a dark ice tea pour appears a dark brazilian cherry wood in the glass . the head is smooth and frothy , beige in color , and rose an initial 2 fingers high . the retention was moderate leaving a generous film coating behind as a lacing . s : a bit of sour malt is experienced upfront with some stalky vines and dry burbon scents . fresh prunes , mixed in with some dried molasses , comes through . there is definitely a muskiness coming from the yeast but surprisingly no trace could be found of its 14.5 % abv . t : the alcohol is present and quite apparent on the open combined with some boozy dark fruit , caramelized brown sugars , and sweet malt juice . dried molasses , rum raisin , dark cherries and some spicy cola also add some spicy variety to the mix . the alcohol is spicy and hot , of dried maple syrup and some cinnamon notes adding a zing to the punch with some vanilla influence . the overall palate is one that was very sweet , vinous , and provided a big acidic bite on the finishing take . overall a generally sweet but deeply complex drink that reveals a rich chocolate malt presence upon warming to room temp . another winner from this bruery . m : the mouthful is light , very warming with a spicy bite on the tongue . oily and slippery feel provides for a great hold with a burbon dryness coming though on the tongue upon the swallow . d : your definitely not gon na be putting this down to quickly or in any quantity , the only reason for my average drinkability rating . the overall enjoyment is one that is very high , but the big acidic nature and alcohol kick is one that makes this an honest slow sipper . a bomber pushes the further end of the drinking spectrum , not a bad idea to share this with a friend unless you want to devote a good 45 minutes on this . vinous in nature and should be treated as such , small portions at a time , sipped and savored in a chalice with a warm ambience .'

S'as all stouts do this one also pours a dark coffee color . a tan head meets the top of the glass and hangs for a spell then leaves no trace . aroma of semi-sweet chocolate is dominate nothing more and nothing less . the taste was a surprise , i thought it would be over done as some other chocolate type brews but this was well balanced with the chocolate flavor . it was not as sick sweet but a bitter sweet . maybe the malt and hops used blended this well . bottom line enjoyable but too much chocolate could drive me nuts after awhile so i couldnt put this as a session brew but definitely in the desert category . if you have had other chocolate brews and did not care for themtry this one from rogue , it may change your mind .'

S'ok , i am making a huge change from my prior review based on the fresh 2011 bottling . do not know if my palate changed or the beer , but i find it strange that i would find something so much more bitter two years later considering all the ipas i have had . btw , the original review was july 2009 , not november 2009 as listed , so it was also fresh : serving glass : poured from bottle into nonic imperial pint . appearance : burnt reddish-copper with thin head and slight lacing . smell : sweet fruity malts , onion , pineapple , pine , grapefruit and citrus hops , some alcohol noticeable in the background . odd and dank , but distinctive . taste : hop onslaught - definite grapefruit and citrus . some pineapple and onion . complex sweet malts , with caramel , toast and fruit . extremely bitter at the finish - to the point of distraction . somewhat boozy tasting , which does not mesh well with the bitterness and flat out odd hop taste . feel : thick and chewy , smooth , low carbonation . too boozy , but otherwise the mouthfeel is not an issue . original overall comment : excellent slow sipper ( i took an hour ) . overall , great balance of hops and malt but the relatively low bitterness makes this seem more like a hop-forward barleywine than an imperial ipa . new overall comment : comes across as an extremely harsh barleywine . interesting flavors , but very hard to drink , even as a sipper .'

S"a : comes in a weizen glass with a nice 3 finger head that remains through most of the beer . some lacing is noticeable . the beer is hazy and sort of true to the style , but i find that this beer is a bit whitish/pale for the style . s : smells like citrus and clove . possibly some malt and banana in the background . why is there any citrus in here ? the tart/banana/clove/fruity aromas are so muted they are almost absent . smells suspiciously like a standard american-wheat , which is n't bad , but this beer fails to emulate the style properly and thus remains average at best . t : citrus and wheat malt . a touch of clove spicyness and no hops . no complexity and no authenticity . even forgetting that this is supposed to be a robust hefe , this beer remains a rather bland american-wheat beer at best . m : overly carbonated and average . d : no authenticity , no flavor , no deal . next beer please . o : a very bland hefe-weisse that fails to have any resemblance to the bavarian beers to which this one was named . other thoughts : there are better beers at abc , get their belgians instead ( which are quite tasty ) ."

S'poured from the 500ml can into a tall pilsner glass . a : the beer is a lighish golden color with a big 3 finger foamy slightly offwhite head with ok retention , leaving some lacing on the glass . a little carbonation is evident within , and the beer is crystal clear . s : bready malts and grassy hops with a touch of citrus in the middle there , as well as a mildly spicy note . overall very clean with a touch of hoppiness evident . t : nice malt character on the intro of bread or really light biscuit profile . a bit of citrus lurking around in there , and grassiness . finishes with a light herbal character and a touch of balanced bitterness and bread . f : light and crisp , but with a medium body . d : good flavor and relatively low alcohol make this an obvious go to in the drinkability department . overall this is a great option for someone looking for a solid taste but also something pretty light and easy drinking . this is a classic , and for good reason .'

S"appearance : vicious pour netted roughly two fingers of foamy , sticky , tan head . body is a dark brown color with more transparency than one would think for a stout . looks a bit like a porter . as head dies down , it leaves web-like lacing around the sides of the glass . smell : tons of malt and roasted aromas up front . mocha , bread , caramel , and some pine also in the mix . i think i 'm catching some herbal spicy notes , too . wish this smell were a bit stronger , but other than that it 's quite good . taste : mocha and dark chocolate , followed quickly by caramel/toffee , pine , and spice . finishes with roasted notes and hops , possibly some caramel too . roasted flavors become more prevalent as beer warms . mouthfeel : fairly light-bodied for a stout . carbonation is a bit higher than i 'd like , though it 's feeling much smoother now that i 'm on the second bottle . good amount of mouth numbing , though this stout does n't seem to coat the mouth too well . this is a clean feeling stout , similar to and irish dry stout . drinkability : this is not a challenging stout , but it sure is a drinkable one . flavors are a little under-pronounced , but the light ( er ) body allows you to have several before getting full . i 'm going to drink a second right now . edit : drinking second right now , and it tastes even smoother . enjoy !"

S'22 oz bomber into my beautiful goblet . pours a nice hazed orage-red copper color with an off white 1 finger head that laces well . tinge of hops with a sweet lingering scent as you inhale more deeply . smells a little bit fruity with orange/grapefruit characteristics showing through , hint of spice . really nice hop bitterness that balances out the nice sweet malts , some scents carry over having a nice orange like citrus quality to it.finishes moderatly dry with a beutiful lingering after hop . the 11 % abv is hardly noticable and will kick you to the floor . the hops make the mouthfeel a little bit syrupy but in a good way . slick hops move way to the nice moderate carbonation that trys to even things out . share this with a friend as the drinkability can be a little low due to alcohol . a really well crafted iipa . i love southern tiers products so far and cant wait to try more'

S"08 release obtained from tom 's farm in corona on my way home from work . poured this into a pint glass , cloudy with a deep orange/amber hue . gave me a nice cream colored , two finger head that left beautiful lace rings down the sides of the glass as it was drunk . initial smell is an intense bready malt with hoppy grapefruit and alcohol close behind . taste of hard hitting caramel malt and citrus hop bitterness . warmth of the alcohol content is there as well . another wonderful brew from stone . my first plunge into the barleywine world and it did n't disappoint . drinkability is a bit limited due to the alcohol but i could still definitely throw back a couple of these . good stuff ."

S"pours a spirit-thick black with shining dark amber edges and a small , thin medium brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves without a trace . smell is of bourbon , vanilla , chocolate , a hint of coffee , and hazelnut . absolutely amazing . it 's bourbon hot all the way through in the flavor , but is accompanied well by sweet dark fruits up front that soon give way to chocolate and vanilla . the finish adds a hint of coffee roastiness , which gives a sense of burnt hazelnut/walnuts . this is truly one of the best imperial stouts available . every flavor is bursting to the extreme , and all mingle well together . the mouthfeel is outstanding . just the right amount of carbonation for its extreme thickness . the drinkability is fantastic for such a high abv/thick beer . definitely one of my favorites ."

S"pours a hazy 24 karat gold color , with considerable amounts of chunkiness floating in it , despite a very slow pour . protein flakes everywhere in the beer , makes this truly disgusting to look at . no head and no lacing to speak of . the smell is one step up from the appearance , showing wheat , a lot of belgian yeast esters , sour apples , a hint of citrus hops , and caramel . again , one step up from the aroma is the flavor , which is heavily spicy , espceically corainder and black pepper . it is also very sweet . some light fruits show through , pears , granny smith apples , even a bit of underripe strawberry . mouthfeel is probably the heaviest i 've ever tasted . no other way to describe it but thick . it almost feels like you 're drinking gravy . all in all , one of the most dynamic beers i 've ever tasted . i 've never had something taste , look , and smell almost completely diferrent . aside from looking pretty bad , this beer is great i think , as are most of de dolle 's offerings . think white beer , on steroids . i think that 's pretty close ."

S"pours lighter than i expected . i realise it 's a weizenbock , but with visions of aventinus dancing in my head , i was struck by how pale this is . golden , properly wheat-esque ; i should n't be surprised at all . your regular wheat beer banana and clove smells , with a pleasant yoghurt note and apricots , maybe even peaches with the skin still on . very sweet . more banana in the taste - liquid banana bread . cloves , underlying rummy alchohol thing which complements everything really well - slight boozy burn which you can occasionally feel in your sinuses , even though it 's not quite 8 % . peppery spice and noticeable but not overt hop bitterness in the finish . probably not quite enough to cut through the sweetness , but whatever . real tasty . realatively creamy mouthfeel , some champagne characteristics from a combination of the carbonation and the vague dry white wine notes in the finish . too sweet to drink too much of , and too heavy to drink after mowing the lawn ( or is it.. ? ) - this beer , i think , is a fine example of just plain great craftsmanship , and what you choose to or choose not to match it with is up to you . i still have half a bottle , and i 'm definitely going to enjoy it , as is ."

S"hmm , so schmaltz has swayed from branding themselves exclusively as the jew brew . not that there 's anything wrong with he'brew as a brand , but the creepy guy on the coney island bottles is a lot cooler . and what 's better , the profits from this here brew are going to preserve coney island , which from what i gather is now the pet cause of wmfu-types . sweet . pours apa orange brown , very lightly hazy with a nice big white head . it smells like a very nice hop profile when i hold the bottle up to my nose but then when i pour it it smells like a firm pilsener . the hops are still there , but man that 's a weird shift ( and it happened in two separate glasses , too ) . still , the hop profile be very firm for a pils . it 's managed well against a much more traditional czech malt . tastes pretty much like a traditional czech pils . ( not much like a red ) . the hops are bit more varied and american-tasting than you might find in , say , urquell or prima pils . this is a nice change , but it 's also lacking that wonderful dryness that a really great pils tends to have , and this complexity of the hop also blots out the malt profile just a smidge . still , very tasty and nicely balanced . but not quite an elite beer ."

S"this pours amber with lots of gloppy things and stuff bouyant in the drink like bubbles of a gelatinus hand soap . let 's call it `` suspended floaties '' . yes , i will ingest this . smells okay . thick alcohol wiskey-like smells ( duh ) , and some sparkley hops . tastes primarily like sweet alcohol wiskey or some hard liquor ( pardon my lack of an accurate hard liquor correlation , i do n't know my hard liquors well at all ) . mouthfeel is thick and alcoholic . i had to rate it a `` 3 '' , though it is not `` average '' at all . just the good and the bad weigh out to a `` 3 '' . it is too alcoholic , but there is some creaminess . finish is like benzocane on the tongue . this is an interesting experience . it must be sipped . try one just for the challenge of consuming a 13 % alcohol beverage ."

S"smell ; quite a good hop odor , with other characters that reminded me of typical american microbrews with too much hops . a little more balanced than most . taste ; very complex , with some toasty barley notes , hops mostly prevailed but not too excessive , still could be less . however i ca n't blame them , nearly every american beer drinker i know , who is a step above macrobrew garbage , is a hophead ! they just must be catering to the consumer but not so much so that non-hopheads ca n't enjoy as well . mouthfeel ; sharp carbonation takes away any watery qualities , almost some thickness but no , i think it 's the alcohol numbing my tongue . very nice , perhabs the most memorable feature . drinkability ; one is enough ! i 'd drink doppelbock in excess before this . not enough malts to balance with the hops for me but would certainly drink again . not really my kind of beer but i have still much to learn of the style . i liked it but i guess i 'm not arrogant enough to be worthy ."

S"from notes at the brewery : an india pale ale that explores a single hop variety and showcases the aromas , flavors and bittering qualities that are unique to each strain . this time around we explored the `` nugget '' hop . a spicy , yet floral hop used primarily for bittering & flavor . 7.0 % abv 90+ ibu's a translucent brown , kind of boring really . 2.0 s nice floral hop smell . the bitterness is there but there is a nice floral , almost sweet smell to it . 4.0 t hops bitterness is in front for sure , minimal malt to balance it out makes this one bitter beer . 3.5 m moderate as the body itself is father thin but the hops build up the feel . 3.0 d not that good in this unbalanced ipa . 2.0 notes : i really do appreciate the effort of the brewery to feature a single hop as it allows the taster to really experience that particular hop . this beer was too unbalanced for my tastes ."

S"i decided to try a walkerville brewing company beer today , perhaps more out of allegiance to my hometown of windsor than for any conscious reason - i grabbed a six-pack from the shelves of the lcbo and was on my way . unfortunately , while i would love it to be , it 's far from special . it instills no pride in my windsor , makes me feel no warmth towards it . the fact of the matter is that walkerville premium blonde is the definition of an average beer in almost every facet - miles ahead of its macro equivalents , but beyond that , nothing special . appearance is the colour of a pale macro lager , essentially - though perhaps a bit more golden in hue . it 's topped by a mere one finger of head that dissapates quickly , though it leaves considerable lacing . very much in-line with what i 've seen in the style , but nothing spectacular at all . smell is pleasant - though again , nothing special . smells 'crisp , ' with faint hints of apples and apricots . malty , with some grassy hops . sweet graininess . beyond that , there 's very little discernable beyond those general statements . taste is crisp , though far from complex . malty throughout , very bread-y and biscuity . i 'd be hard pressed , though , in a blind taste test , to distinguish this ale from any of a rather large number of lagers . that 's not to knock it , however , because this is rather refreshing . sour apples are hinted throughout the taste , along with a grassy hoppiness . finish is dry , though not excessively , and the beer is generally quite well-balanced , though contrasted slightly with a faint bitterness upon swallowing . ultimately , the best thing i can say in terms of taste are that walkerville 's premium blonde is crisp and refreshing ; going any further is difficult . mouthfeel is pretty good , however - a substantial body belies the pale golden of the brew , and carbonation is crisp , though certainly not obtrusive . walkerville premium blonde gets its highest points , though , in drinkability . though simple and perhaps a little bland , this little brew is one of the most refreshing , thirst-quenching beers i 've tried in awhile . it would be a pleasure to imbibe a few of these with friends on a hot summer night . it 's for that reason that i could see myself buying this beer again ( though i 'd probably go directly to the source to obtain it in the future , some time when i 'm home in windsor for a weekend ) , and why i 'd reccomend it to anyone who asked . average , certainly , but there 's something that 's just so 'no-nonsense ' about"

S'750ml corked & caged bottle split . poured into a tulip . bottled january 2010 . ( a ) - pours a clear golden orange color that produced a great white head that left a thin ring of lacing as it slowly dissipated . ( s ) - yeasty , with a good woody oak vanilla-ish bourbon note in front of a light biscuity-wheat & banana earthiness ; very subtle though . ( t ) - a light & spicy wheat & lemon behind a big , warm , & woody oak vanilla sweet middle . finishes the same as the middle . ( m ) - a good carbonation level . a tad high in the boozy warmth as it goes down with that oaky vanilla sweetness . some of the traditional tripel nuances come through , but at this stage , the barrel aging is taking center stage . the richest tripel to have crossed my lips . ( d ) - an interesting tripel . i have never seen a bourbon barrel aged one at that , so this one intrigued me . definitely is a good one , but the barrel aging definitely overpowers most of what this has to offer ; over time should smooth this out . i am glad i split this , cause i would have difficulty .'

'' discernable hoppiness from the get go . mouthfeel - light to watery side . drinkability - an easy drinking beer , one that stands out amongst meager domestic offerings , but certainly does n't stand up to the average craft brewer . will drink again ."

S'golden lager with a two finger off-white head and good lace and retention , transluscent . smell is nothing to write home about , mostly lacking . taste features a feint hop presence , nicely balanced in terms of bitterness with just enough malt to round it out . this is a nice everyday drinking lager with good retention , above average , especially for a mass marketed lager .'

S"served in straight pint glass . poured a very deep brown , with just a faint reddish tint , and had about an inch of light brown head that decent retention and good lacing . the aroma was fairly typical in its maltiness , although not as roasty as a lot of other porters . on the tongue nothing really noticeable jumped out , but neither was there anything lacking . just good , solid , rich malt and a light tickle of hops . the body was too thin for the style , imho , but still coated the tongue nicely . drinkability was very good , if you 're in a porter mood , these will go down easily all day . overall , a nice , solid , although unspectacular , brew . worth trying ."

S'a- pale golden yellow with a pretty large head . quite clear of a beer as well , leaves light lacing s- bready , pleasant but nothing outstanding t- little bit of hoppiness and slight sourness but otherwise quite plain . is what i would expect from a pale lager though . m- light body with medium-high carbonation . relatively crisp and refreshing finish . d- definitely drinkable , not a great beer in any sense though but that is an issue with the style . would much rather be drinking these all night than an mass-brew beer , but would expect to pay the same price for it .'

S"turbodog is quite an anomaly as it does n't fit neatly into a particular beer style mold . the body and mouthfeel are appropriate for a nut brown , but the roasted flavors are more akin to a stout ( albeit a light one ) and it is quite clean , almost lager-like . it pours a dark , dark mahogany with a thin off-white head . the smell is strong with dark roasted malts and it also has that quality i can only describe as `` beery '' . roasted malt dominates the palate but comes with some light toffee sweetness . mildly spicy hops are noticeable but never come to the foreground . a bit thin and watery . not an exceptional brew , but exceptional in its originality . this would make an excellent dark summertime session brew and would pair very well with spicy food ."

S"the beer poured into the chalice crystal clear pale straw . the head was very low and white and fell quickly to the edges of the surface but did last to lace the glass . artisanal is the best word to describe what the aroma was like . it had a bit of aromas like an ale that had been `` laid down '' , a farmhouse ale aroma . behind that was a slight sweetness . the aroma also contained a metallic portion . the flavor was light , almost too light . within that flavor was a slight lactic sourness and a very light spice . the finish was even with a lasting bit of subtle spice and sourness that slightly turn toward dry . the body was medium light and crisp . the beer was very refreshing , but not complex at all . 11.2 ounce bottle . the bottle said artisanal wheat ale which is probably correct . this is not a witbier and probably should not be reviewed as a witbier ."

S"on-tap at the brewery . 2010 vintage consumed at triple rock 's debut of this during sf beer week . a : received in a snifter that revealed a jet-black body with half an inch of mocha-colored head . retention was poor , with a few trails of lace down the glass . s : very sensitive to temperature . not much at first , but after letting it warm , it became a delicious bouquet of dark rum , molasses , bittersweet chocolate , roasted malt , and a small amount of coffee . t : the 2009 vintage was on the sweet side , but the 2010 is even sweeter , and it 's not appealing . it is dominated by dark rum , molasses , and a dark berry flavor ( i thought blackberries or currants ) . the chocolate contains a substantial milk flavor instead of being pure dark . the only contrast is from roasted malt / coffee , but they do n't negate the sugars well enough . m : full-bodied , low carbonation that makes it very creamy . it 's hard not to notice the abv ( which crept up to 13 % in the 2010 batch ) , but it 's not exactly hot . d : i 'm pretty disappointed with this compared to last year , and so was my girlfriend . she 's normally not excited about beer , but she loved ks '09 and was hoping that the '10 batch would be just as good . sadly , it 's pretty meh in its new form . above average , but not greatly so ."

S"2004 . beer pours an opaque black with ruby/brown edges ... dark ale indeed . fizzy brownish head that disappears almost instantaneously . smell is appley yeast and alcohol with some red wine woody tones . taste is strangely complex , but i 'm not sure in a good way . i 'm getting figs , apples , yeast , sugar , strong alcohol ( almost vodka-ish ) , and an aftertaste of chocolate creme and roasty malts . mouthfeel is surreal , because it 's thin but with a harsh carbonation . this is n't a very smooth sipper , and i almost feel compelled to drink it faster to get it over with . i do n't know.. it 's getting hot in here ."

S"wow ! a tripel at harper 's ? i actually wrote down my review for this a few months ago , when it was available . pours cloudy yellow/orange with a little white head . very strong clove smell , with a definite alcohol presence . taste is extremely clove dominated and malty with a very strong alcohol presence , almost overbearing . mouthfeel is smooth and rounded , but the alcohol presence is uncomfortable . not very drinkable , an ok beer , but i think it was kicked up a few notches too many so that all the college kids could have something to talk/brag about ."

S"stone makes every beer tempting with just one look at the bottle and this is no exception ... and i suspect like any others , i am a sucker for anything `` anniversary '' , seasonal , or limited edition . neither sorry nor ecstatic that i went for this one . dark coppery/amber colored with a taste and smell of nuttiness battling hops with alcohol cheering them on . a mix of all three , though not in enough harmony to rate higher on the drinkability scale . tasty ; worth a try and one is enough ."

S"this holiday stout pours a chocolate bar black with a lively , root beer-colored head and bubbly carbonation . the sticky web of lacing hangs to the glass briefly before fading away . the aroma is like an ingredient list for a candy bar . roasted peanuts , warm caramel , vanilla , nougat , chocolate and powdered cinnamon are all part of the scent buffet . flavor profile opens with a dark chocolate that is n't overly sweet and ends with the sizzle of booze , vanilla bean and harsh espresso . taste leaves a licoricey film on the tongue that displays a certain dryness that is n't initially noticeable on a sip-to-sip basis . sweetness is subdued enough to not smash the palette . it 's also rather easy to consume , reminding me of the insane drinkability of an old rasputin . another good stout from port brewing . note : when pouring the remainder of the 22oz bottle after my first glass , a gelatinous black and white blob , like a melted combination of dark and white chocolate flopped on top of the liquid . it had the consistency of petroleum jelly and seemed to be mold . i 'm obviously not certain what it was , but it was definitely gross ! i 've removed points from the appearance section to compensate ."

S"22 oz bomber bottle acquired via trade from spacecoyote . poured into a martell cognac snifter . a : turbid black/brown with crimson edges and a nice head of deep ark espresso foam that fizzes and dies down to a small circular ring of skim . s : aromas are sweet and recall milk , various oats and grains , roasted malt tones , and some mellowed yet greenish hop cones . the aromas are good but not as pronounced and `` in your face '' as i would like . t : taste is bigger and more complex than the aroma suggests . dark fruit , christmas spices , plums , raisins , cocoa , and roasted malt with just a slight hint that there are any hops in the mix . taste is good , but not over the top . m : mouth feel is thin , almost watery , but well balanced , with a slight prick of carbonation on the tongue . d : the sum is greater than the parts with this beauty . whilst it is a little simple for my liking the thin mouth feel and even flavours make for an incredibly easy drinking stout of this size and abv . awesome . overall : this is a nice oatmeal/imperial/double stout from an ohio brewery that i have not had any other beers from . although not the most complex it is an easy sipper and a good introduction to heavier stouts in general . cherers !"

S"as i make my way through the belgians ( i have a ways to go ) i 've found my favorites to be the tripel and the quad , so i picked this bottle up to give it a try . st. petrus is a belgian tripel from belgium , but north american brewers have brewed better ( allagash tripel , la fin du monde ) . the low alcohol content and the watery taste lead to me describe this beer as a `` tripel lite '' . its also a bit too sour and unimpressive in both smell and mouthfeel . its endlessly drinkable which is not a characteristic i look for in a tripel but may be a good intro to belgians . however there are better examples of the style out there for cheaper . i 'll wo n't pick up this beer again ."

S'been a long , long day ..so this looked pretty appetizing on the beer shelf . regular pyramid stubbie brown bottle and regular label . poured into a tall pilsner glass..this actually got quite a good pure white foamy head that lingered well..maybe it was just the tall thin glass ? nice slightly hazy apricot color ..like this . aroma is mostly of dried apricot..but some floral type hops are present..overall it well done . mmtaste is pretty smooth even creamy..certainlly there is a good taste of apricot..but also sweet malts and at the end there is a small bitterness..presumably the hops..ok nice and smooth on the mouth.maybe a litle thin though . though weak in some departments this is an extremelly drinkable beer..when your dog tired .'

S"due to the unseasonably cold weather , infact the coldest day in '08 since february , i decided to indulge in this '07-'08 bottle . the hazy orange hue is only cut by the highlights of copper and gold in this brew . reminds me of a cask ale . a thin , tight head sits atop . aromas of american oak , candied citrus and english malts all come together . at 10 % , the alcohol is completey void hidden beneath the layers of resiny wood and malt . moderate carbonation brings back the citrusy hops and exaggerated oak flavors , void of any alcohol heat . slightly viscous , not quite dry , this aged brew dances on the boarderline with it 's medium to full body . it 's drinkability is only hindered by its rich , flavorful complexity . this beer is to be savored and enjoyed . this beer 's layers of flavor are quite symbolic , they will be able to warm you on a bitter cold evening . if you 've been saving this beer , i would encourage you to pour it now ."

S"first off , let me start by saying -- with the exception of pilsner urquell and a few other czech beers -- i am not at all a hophead . i must also confess that i 'm a tad biased against samuel adams in that i find many times they try to recreate beer styles when they should be creating their own . that said , on to the review : appearance - wonderful golden and clear , a vigorous pour resulted in a two-finger head that settles down to a fine cap after a few minutes . aroma - what can you say ? halltertau , tettnanger , spalt , lublin , and saaz all wrapped together in a perfect blend . not much malt comes through , but just wait : taste - luscious , the flavors of all the hops are there in perfect balance , yet a sweetish malt flavor cuts through to even things out . fantastic job . mouthfeel - perfectly carbonated , and the viscosity of the brew is neither thin nor syrupy . drinkability - like a pilsner urquell , i do n't think i could session this beer only because the flavors are so assertive . but is that so bad ? samuel adams ' best effort yet . i 've a new-found respect for this company . : )"

S"pours a nice golden amber colour , clear in body with a stunning head , nice and generous , medium bubbles with lace that would stop a lorry . i do n't know what that means , but fuck it 's good . this beer has a better body than angelina jolie in beer form . nice , slow bead . pretty goddamn nice indeed . nose is quite delicious . hugely malty with massive fresh coconut notes all over that , lots of caramel and toffee and a slight dessert wine character as well . very slight lime juice touch just adds a hint of acidity . somehow this is at once toasty and sweet like a hearty , warm english pub , yet tropical like a sunkissed belizean beach . just staggeringly good . taste is quite strong and malty , but yeah very boozey on the mid . lots of caramel on the front with a slight fruity edge , touch of citrus and maybe some plum as well . coconut comes to the fore on the mid and dominates a slightly nutty flavour overall , with hints of roasted peanut and sesame as well . finish has a real boozey strength to it though , gets even more heated at the back with a cognacy oomph ! just bashing it down the throat . it 's a nice warmth , but it really does have the ethanol-style strength , and would be nicer if the malt sweet stickiness continued for longer , or had more powerful hopping to counteract the effect . but an impressive and beautiful beer , i 'd say it would be orgasmic with a bit more age on it . good body , the beer coats the mouth well with its texture , but does n't go overboard with stickinesss . warmth is great for winter , which it still is . overly strong on the back - without the heat this would be more drinkable , but it is still a very nice , tasty sipping beer ."

S"draught at the brewpub . i was excited to give this a try after hearing that it was the prototype for publication , which is one of my favorite beers from these guys . i have to say that vinnie 's explanation of the differences between this and the final version are pretty much spot on . it is hoppier ( very hoppy for a saison actually , and the brewery alternately describes it as a hoppy belgian blond ale or a belgian blond ale on brett depending on whether you read the website of the chalkboard at the pub ) and has a much more forceful brettanomyces aroma and flavor . blond in color with a medium head . the aroma is just a blast of spicy hops and brett , funky , wet hay and leather , with a light fruity touch . it lacks the more expressive fruit that publication has though . the flavor is lean , dry , and bitter with lots of snappy hops and light brett funk . the malt is a nice pale bready base , but is not really notable in the balance . the body is light and carbonation is standard . honestly , another well crafted and balls-out saison from vinnie . i can see why the publicans wanted a toned down version though , and i do think that their requests resulted in a more pleasing beer overall , as the more balanced brett and hops let the fruitiness of the primary yeast stand out more"

S"big thanks to georgiabeer for throwing this bottle in as an extra . a - pours a cloudy deep golden color , one-finger white head with retention around the edges , small amount of lacing s - big aroma of sour granny smith apples and good old barnyard funk , a little bit of leather in there as well t - very tart and sour up front , lots of granny smith apple that makes your cheeks pinch , mid-palate is dominated by a strong funkiness and engulfs the entire mouth , very nice acidity , finish is of fading funk with hints of leather , finish is quite dry , absolutely stellar gueuze m - very intense tartness and sourness attacks the palate aggressively , moderate to high carbonation , light to medium bodied , quite dry on the finish d - one 375ml bottle is enough due to the style more than anything , the dry finish and harsh tartness and sourness limits the drinkability , that said , i 'd love to have this regularly awesome beer ... one of the best - if not the best - sour ale i 've tried . i wish i could get this at my local store , because it would be a weekly indulgence . well worth seeking a bottle out ."

S'a 7oz bottle dated 1996 . sampled in october of 2004 . this is the stuff dreams are made of . strong nose full of sweetness . fig taste is prominate . sweet malts really show through in this one . a fresh bottle is full of harsh flavors that tear the taste buds . this holds the same flavors folded neatly into each other . ultra heavy on the palate . could never drink more than one 12oz bottle of this , but i bet i pull two of these nippers !'

S'on-tap at the brewery , this selection pours a clear red amber with a frothy white head that leaves some very nice lace . sweet citrus and hops in the nose . very fruity and somewhat mellow . definitely creates anticipation though . very fruity with tangy sweetness . not a lot of hops , very malty . an odd style choice , i expected more ipa characteristics . lots of fruit however : citrus , apple , berry , and a bit of bitter hops in the finish . good amount of warmth as well . i would have liked to see more hops . moderate carbonation and nice smoothness throughout . warm , semi-dry finish . very different in a good way .'

S"12 oz'er courtesy of larsenju . poured into my duvel green tulip pours and a very murky golden yellow that is not see-through at all . from an average pour a giant 3 finger head of white foam erupted . leaves beautiful lacing for a hef . smell is very off putting to me . i get a tingle in my nose from the alcohol and then an overwhelming scent of bananas to cover it up . taste is exactly like the smell just a little more bearable . slight alcohol then an explosion of banana that coats my mouth . i actually like the aftertaste quite a bit thats why the score was n't lower . mouthfeel i think is probably how it 's suppose to be . first imperial weizen so i 'm not sure . it did drink relatively smoothly . not really impressed by this one at all and i 'm a little upset since it was my first new glarus brew . i look forward to trying the belgian red and raspberry tart that are in the cellar . thanks again justin !"

S"bronze and copper color with a thin head in my glass . sticky lace throughout . very big floral , herbal and earthy nose . mega hop influence in this bomber . the tase is big , fat fucking hop balls . much meatier than your typical double ipa . citrus ? fuck no ! piney and hoppy is more like it . one big schlonged brew . chewy mouthfeel . a single bomber affair for me . if you 're into seriously aggressive hops , this is for you ."

S"a - upon first pouring this clear , yet vry dark , auburn brew , i thought this beer was going to have no head at all . but after it had sat for about ten seconds half an inch of head sprug up . an interest effect i do n't recall encountering before . the head itself had large bubble and left no lacing after it dissipated about two minutes later . s - smokey bourbon aroma with a touch of coffee caramels and elderberry extract . pleasant for sure . this aroma reminds me a bit of some of the baltic porters i have had . t - very mild flavor . it is a bit smokey with a touch of soy sauce , but in a good way , there is a very , very light charcoal sort of bitter in the aftertaste . not a single negative character . it is put together well . m - flat , thin and hella refreshing . d - outstanding . this is just above water in terms of refreshment . i finished this before i finished my review , which is a rarity when i do them simultaneously . honestly , if a local bar served this , i could drink a pint of this every day with my dinner . since porters do n't rank high on my list of favorite styles , that is quite a statement . it is really an everyday dort of beer . the price here is n't bad , so i imagine england is much better off . i would n't say it is the greatest thing"

S"managed to find bottles of this sold in singles , and as i found an option of not having to pay $ 17 canadian for a 6 of it , the prospect became more tempting , given my past experience with the pale lager . came in the geometrically bevelled , cudgel-like triangular bottle , a red label this time with the viking biting his thumb , the norse ship thermal symbol on the back of the label . the best before dates on the back are also not marked off . pours out a cloudy/murky amber walnut colour , small fizzle of head that lapses to nothing in a matter of moments . the aroma is of wort and strong carmelized sugar . flavour contains that sweet sugary caramel flavour , which masks some astringent off flavour on the aftertaste , of which i can only hope comes from some hop content , but i have my doubts . mouthfeel is bland and nondescript , not quite watery , but not full either . more off flavours the farther down the glass i get . perhaps the original product in russia is far better than what i got my hands on here in canada , perhaps i got an old bottle , but i ca n't say i 'll be returning for more of this stuff at any given time , let alone finishing this glass . at least i have one more cool bottle for homebrewing ."

S"i 'll preface this review by saying that i have n't had an american macro lager in years , and in 25+ years of drinking i 've never tried a pbr . but i saw on this forum that it 's arguably the best of the macros , so i thought i 'd give it a try , and at the very least it might give me more appreciation for the quality brews i usually drink . pours an extremely pale clear amber with a big head and very active carbonation that quickly subsides to a tiny cap . no lacing to speak of . very little in the nose ... light graininess with maybe a touch of sweet malt . i 'm not detecting a bit of hops . okay ... i guess when others are talking about it 's `` clean '' taste , that means there really is n't much taste . really if i did n't know what i was drinking i might think this is soda water . slightly sweet , almost no bitterness , slightly metallic ( can ? ) with a dry finish . medium mouthfeel that seems better than most other macros i 've tried ... not quite as thin and with a lot of carbonation that seems to last a while . easy to drink , but so is water . i guess with macro lagers , the less taste you get is best ... if my memory serves me right bud and miller have some very foul flavors in there , which this beer does n't . nothing offensive to slow you down , and i can see where folks going after a cheap buzz might like it . especially those who do n't like the taste of beer . me ... i 'll stick with something with a lot more flavor ."

S"brew date : sept. 8 , 2010 . best by sept. 8 , 2011 . appearance : pale yellow color , had less than a finger of soapy-looking foam from a vigorous pour . short retention time , leaving a thin ring of bubbles . very little lacing . smell : very light sweet aroma , somewhere between malt and rice . taste : just on the bitter side of the sweet-bitter dichotomy . can definitely taste some rice in there . a fairly typical , and unexciting adjunct lager . mouthfeel : not much . has about the same body as water . crisp finish , adequate carbonation . overall : another ho-hum adjunct lager . nothing special about this one . i think i 'll pass on this one next time ; there are just so many better beers to have ."

S'( served in an american pint glass ) a- this beer has a warm apricot colored body with a very slight hazy to it and a strong carbonation pushing through it . there is a thin light tan head that fades to a few spots soon after it is poured . s- this beer has notes of sweet caramel malt followed by a green hop smell . as it warms there is a light note of citrus in the hops but it is mostly big green hops . t- the sweet flavor of caramel malt comes through strong setting the tongue up for a crushing pungent bitterness of hops . the hops have a grapefruit flavor to them and a soft citrus zest hint as it warms . m- this beer has a medium mouthfeel with a slippery texture to it with no alcohol heat or fizz in the finish . d- this beer has a big sweetness and a bigger bitterness but not much depth to either of them . i like the flavors but they get a bit tiresome after one glass .'

S"had this on tap at my place restaurant in newtown , ct . pours a golden amber color , with a thick white head . great head retention lasting all the way through the beer . i was expecting it to be a little darker , but this 'll do . aroma is a strange understated hoppiness , much less than i expected , with a significant alcohol presence , plenty of malt , with some fruity esters , mainly pear , plum , and fig . the flavor starts out brutally hoppy , but as your palate adjusts , becomes much maltier and more complex . hops are interesting , appearing all the way through the sip . they start out sort of citric , then become more herbal when coupled with the alcohol in the finish . a vague pine-like woody feel to the beer , with plenty of alcohol presence . the malts are very much like single malt scotch , with that overwhelming sweetness , and a touch of peat . this beer got extremely sweet by the end of the glass , with the hops only appearing in the very beginning of the sip , and tapering off quickly to a very alcoholic maltiness . it 's a good beer , but definitely something for special occassions . i do n't think it has a great drinkability , because it starts off pretty hoppy and ends with an almost single malt sweetness . overwhelming each way . could be a wonderful after dinner beer after a great meal ."

S"you may notice i have reviewed a decent amount of cheap `` oat-sodas '' lately . i am on a budget and while rather snobbish generally , am getting a kick out of going old school with my drinking preferences . plus , i do n't have any choice . ahhhh the beast . this is also not a good beer . i find it tastes of metal can , grain and carbonation with thinly veiled alcohol . it is very cheap @ $ 6.79 for 12x12 . now if exceptionally cold , it is quite drinkable however and for that reason it is perfect for pool parties , boating , beach or new orleans summers etc where you are so damn hot that all you need is thirst quenching sweet sweet alcohol ."

S"i would n't consider this the end-all/be-all of beers , but it 's another great offering from stone . 2007 batch , found at a local supermarket , managed to snag the last two bottles . one for now , and one for later ! a - looks great , how an imperial stout should pour . great dark head , but leaving little lacing . i 'm curious as to how clean the glass i poured it into was orignally . black , oily goodness . s - smell is great but dare i say.. could be better ? i 'm not getting much more than a crazy yeast affect , with tinges of chocolatey malt undertones . i smell coffee and a major alcohol overtone as well . my mouth is watering . t - perfect . what a ris should taste like . i 've never had a better offering , on tap or in bottle . the variety of flavors is definitely second to none , and should be experienced by all ba 's . served a little cooler than room temperature , nuances jump out at you like hot embers from a fire . chocolate , plums , raisins , coffee , alchohol , anise ( barely ) ... all put together with a creamy silk-like mouthfeel . as if they were n't already aware , stone really does a great job with this beer . d - the only qualm i have against this huge beer is the abv , which can smack you in the face quicker than you 'd like to imagine . i 've only nipped my glass a couple times and already feel the effects . i ca n't imagine drinking more than 2 bombers . all in all , another beautiful beer from stone . they really know how to brew a good drink !"

S"thanks to grynder33 for the generosity . this is my first experience with this brewery . some big , bold bourbon flavors here . i have to disagree with the reviewers who claim they blend well or are attenuated with other tastes ; this is a bourbon tasting beer , period . not that there is anything wrong with that , mind you . pours a solid stout looking black . no real head , just some minimal bubbling and a dark tan crust . mouthfeel is surprisingly thin . smells like bourbon . the taste is ( wait for it ) ... mostly bourbon . there 's some coffee and chocolate notes ... maybe a hint of molasses/roasted sweetness . but not much . a good beer , but a sipper for when you 're in the mood . just a bit too one-note and boozy for me ."

S"a : light , clear golden yellow body . thick pillowy head . s : sweet honey and grapes . t : honey , white grapes , and a hint of saffron in the finish . a very complex beer with many wine-like characteristics . it reminds me of mead or maybe a dessert wine . does n't taste like beer exactly , but it does taste very good . m : creamy , smooth , medium body . the feel is like a dessert wine that has been carbonated . d : not an everyday beer by any stretch . i split this bottle with my fiancee and it was a wise choice . the alcohol is well hidden , so watch out . the taste is great , but again , it is n't really a beer flavor . worth drinking for the story if nothing else : '' the body of a 60-year-old male was laid out in state on a thick pile of purple and blue-dyed textiles inside a unique log coffin . most remarkably , the tomb held the largest iron age drinking set ever found -- 157 vessels , including a ram-headed and lion-headed situla -- for preparing , serving , drinking and libating a special beverage at the funerary feast of the king . the secrets of the beverage were revealed by the new methods of molecular archaeology . dr. patrick mcgovern of the museum discovered that the residues inside the vessels belonged to a `` phrygian cocktail , '' which combined grape wine , barley beer and honey mead . starting with the ancient chemical evidence , dogfish head brewery `` re-created '' a marvelous golden elixir , truly touched by king midas .

S"damn it this was almost a very nice beer , but for some reason the lovely spicy goodness is washing against a sulphurous egg taste . it 's a struggle for me to judge this beer as obviously a lot of craft went into it 's production , and yet i have to acknowledge that it makes me want to vomit . i will qualify all of this by saying that i hate eggs because i can not bare the sulphurous stink that i experience when they are cooked in any form . i realize i may be hyper-sensitive to that taste/scent . on the good side this beer hasa soft sandalwood scent and foretaste . it 's great just before the rotten egg washes down at the end . it get 's easier with each swallow but to me this tastes like someone is pouring a skunky heineken down my throat just after i 've had a swig of a very nice brew ."

S"appearance - very foamy . head retention not bad , but little to no lacing . a little bit of carbonation activity can be seen , but not champagne-like . color is extremely light straw . smell - very light . perhaps a little corn odor . about normal for a light macro lager . taste - flavor is not near a favorite of mine , but certainly fits light lager style . very crisp and watery . nothing very strong to speak of . only the slightest hints of beer flavor . mouthfeel - watery . drinkability - hey this is is close to water as you can get in a beer . definitely quenching , not real satisfying , though , if you 're after any sort of a beer flavor . i 'm trying to do a better job of reviewing these beers according to bjcp judging standards . under those standards , bud light clearly hits near average on every category . genuinely inoffensive , just like a light lager apparently should be . outside of mere judging standards , however , there 's nothing in particular to recommend this beer ."

S'i have really wanted to like this beer more based upon it being a local brewery . this beer is unremarkable in many ways not bad but not great either . this pale ale pours and gives the appearance of a macro lager with one exception . the beer was absolutely flat with absolutely no carbonation . the smell is nothing remarkable , faint and with little distinction . has a very light somewhat grassy taste . the taste is absolutely that of a macro lager with little distinction in any respect . the absolute lack of carbonation is noticeable and gives an off feeling . yes it is drinkable simply from the aspect it has little distinction or body . this brewery has done a wonderful job creating a tremendous marketing package but they simply do not have the beer to match up .'

S'appearance : orange copper amber hue forms a tiny layer of foam leaves behind spots of thin cream colored lacing . aroma : spiced up nutmeg , all spice insert other pumpkin pie like tones here , evident malty sweetness really heavy own spice and light on pumpkin tones very mild hop character pretty much overshadowed by the spicing only 15 ibu anyway . taste : spices and pumpkin dessert style beer pretty sweet and somewhat sickeningly spiced with a touch of pumpkin gourdiness and lightly toasted mild ale malts no hop character can i detect . mouthfeel : medium to light on the body even carbonation just gets a bit cloying toward the end of a pint i would suggest a half pint serving or at least a twelve ounce . drinkability : not the best of all pumpkin ales i tried seems like this is only the second year brewing this one and still working out the recipe . not a session brew that is for sure i wanted to cut it with some burning river pale ale just to mellow out the pumpkin pie spices . i appreciate the attempt but i know somebody out there other than dogfishead can revolutionize this style that seems like you have to offer it between halloween and thanksgiving , not true .'

S"a- good amount of carbonation , amber body . good lacing , pretty good retention and head formation . s- holy hell . the hops coming off of this are so aggressive . its an explosion of aroma . vegetable , earthen , a bit garlic but the garlic is transient . grassy is the next phase . following that the middle is fruity caramel . back end of sharp citrus without the sweetness and light caramel drizzle . if there is one thing you get out of this , it is that the main player is the hops , and they smack the shit out of your nostrils . t- opens up very aggressive . the hops are all over the palate and fight off the other flavors . instantly bitter , funky onion hop , middle of alcoholic orange . strong citrus that is at least 24 hours infused with ethanol . finish is bitter , not pine , but bitter . falcon hops doing that ? ethanolic all throughout it i realize as it warms a bit . m- aggressive as shit . this beer is hugely alcoholic , hugely hopped , and low on the sweetness . it really does n't balance out . i swear i 've had better dipas for barleywines . very , very unfortunate for me . carbonation is on spot at least . the alcohol is hot and biting . the hops are stabbing and pervasive . the sweetness is.. lacking . sticky , and not even full bodied . it has a medium body , at the most . i was feeling way more inebriated than normal after four to five ounces of this 10 % . it has to , has to be more than 10 % . i 'm really , really disappointed . i 've never had a half acre beer i could n't fall in love with . even the beers others dislike , i have found a soft spot for . this ... maybe in 12 months i 'll like it ."

S'this was the fourth most sold strong beer in sweden in 2004 ( # 4 in 2003 ) colour is yellow with a tint of gold . the airy white foam sinks immediately down to a thin white lid . the smell is a bit sour with malty notes of white bread , some diacetyl and a touch of herbs . the taste is mild with a lot of malts ( with some body ) , some sweetness , diacetyl and some aroma hops that balances the flavours . the bitterness is present , but not much more . the aftertaste is creamy with notes of marzipan and wheat cookies and a slowly growing bitter touch carbonation is strong with medium sized bubbles . in fact , it is on the border of being too strong ; it tickles the whole mouth . a rather anonymous lager , dortmunder or not .'

S"poured into an snifter . 3.5 a : first pour yielded one hand of head . after my fourth round of pouring , i finally had a full glass . black color . two fingers of frothy tan head with pretty good retention and minimal lacing . 4.0 s : surprisingly grainy , which i like . roastiness , some toffee , and a touch of coffee . subtle grassy hops , touch of burnt , and a slight peppery yeastiness . fairly simple , but pleasant nonetheless . 2.0 t : fairly powerful and unbalanced roastiness . i think i 'm detecting some of the orange peel in the form of bitterness , joining with the hops and roastiness . clove and pepper yeastiness . pretty dry . this could benefit from a higher mash temp . oats and brown malt are there and maybe a touch of chamomile . really mismatched flavors . this does n't seem to have any direction . does n't taste anything like a wit . 2.5 m : lighter medium body . carbonation was explosive in the mouth initially . i had to wait a while and drink half the bottle before it was acceptable . i never got to a point in drinking this that i was happy with this . too thin , too carbonated , not particularly smooth . 1.5 d : though the bruery seems to be doing a bit better with carbonation levels now , late last year they overcarbed the hell out of stuff and this is none the different . i 'm all about innovative , but they should have made a test batch of this first , then decided it was n't going to pan out ."

S"appearance : surprisingly dark and refreshing-looking . good foam as well . kind of flat on the carbonation . smell : pungent . sweet . strong . very gassy at the end . taste/mouthfeel : it 's actually ok. malty . again , strong and kind of sweet as well . a bit watery at the same time towards the end . drinkability : icehouse will knock you out of your chair very quickly . overall : one of the most unrefined beers in my opinion . forget coors , icehouse is like a freight train coming into your living room ."

S'presentation : 1 pint 0,9 fl.oz . ( 500ml ) thin , slender brown glass bottle . has a neck , obverse and reverse labels , so often used by the germans . the main label has two small ovals with victorian style color paintings of the lwen and traube breweries . has an advertised established date of 1308 and stated conformance to the reinheitsgebot of 1516 on the main label . under the words , aktien-brauerei kaufbeuren , in germanic font , the beer is listed as jubilums german pils . appearance : extremely pale straw color with a lively soft white frothy head at first . exceptionally clear . the large head and light color lend a very thirst quenching appearance . nose : some biscuit and pilsner malts in the average strength nose . light floral hop aromas at times . taste : served chilled on a warm southern californian night , it has an excellent thirst quenching character that also has enough taste to make the beer appealing . a soft pilsner malt introduction calms the palate . light hops and a mild bitterness finish the beer . quite fruity at times . a crisp , dry finish . mouthfeel : a very smooth mouthfeel , which is soft with a delicate feel at times , which lends great drinkability . an average mouthfeel in strength , which does not detract from the beer at all , and which i find is so characteristic of german pils . nice mix of pilsner malt and light hops in the lingering crisp finish . drinkability : pretty darn good . i can imagine myself sitting outside a german caf or brauhaus sinking a few steins of this pilsner without much effort at all . overall : a german pils , an oxymoron if there ever was one , but all round , a nice effort , which never threatens to overwhelm you with its strong flavor profile . a delicate example of the pilsner style lager . soft pilsner malts and a light hop character . well worth a try .'

S"appearance - amber in color , with slight head out of the bottle . smell - probably the best feature of the beer : a citrus aroma with good amount of hops and malt . taste - sadly , the aroma does n't translate well into the taste . the taste lacked any bite , and it did n't have any flavor hitting the palate . mouthfeel - mild carbonation , but not much else . drinkability - you could have a few in one sitting . however , i would n't try it again ."

S"served on tap , appears medium dark bronze , fairly dense head though not long lasting . aroma is very muted ( unless it was because the beer was served chilled ) hardly any aroma at all , and what there was hinted at sweetness and alcohol rather than much else . taste is almost as expected ( and as others have said ) very sweet , hints of candied fruit and spice , and the malts , but little evidence of hop bitterness . the alcohol is obvious from the impression as it goes down , slightly heavy and warming . rather too sweet for my liking , though sure would warm you up on a cold winters day . because of its sweetness and alcohol strength , would not ever consider it a session beer , and not sure i could drink a whole pint of it ! for that reason i rate drinkability down . i could imagine having a small glass on a cold winters evening , and enjoying sipping it slowly , but not otherwise ! johnw ( while in tampa fl may 2007 ) b'ham uk"

S'mephistopheles foil wrapped , 12oz . bottle with some nice art and descriptions , huge 15.1 % abv. , poured into a snifter . a opaque , dark as night . the maglight wont shine through it at all . head laces excellently , head retention is minimal but ok to style . brown head , micro bubbles . s lots of fusel alcohols , esters . banana , fig , molasses . heavy malt character , dark chocolate and molasses . t cloyingly sweet . would score a bit higher on this with less sweetness . complex flavors of malt , molasses , etc . toward the end feels much more alcoholic with a lessening of the sweetness a bit more like a heavy wine taste with a strong prune/raisin taste toward the end . different , interesting some hop bitterness may offset the massive sweetness . m complex . low carbonation and heavily felt on the tip and middle of the tongue . the aftertaste comes in waves as does the flow of the beer . the alcohol clears the palate well from the 15 % abv. , and there is a cool cascading feeling in the mouth at all times which intensifies toward the end . d- couldnt drink more than one 12oz mostly due to the sweetness and high abv . much more a sipper than anything but a tiny bit hard at times . overall notes bought 2 bottles of this , split the first with my girlfriend . am going to cellar the other one for a long time to see how age will affect this towering brew . would probably not buy this again unless the stored version comes out well it is a bit too sweet ( and strong ) for personal taste .'

S"i got a 4-pack of this 2007 vintage for christmas . the first bottle i tried was prickly hot , almost solventy . i did n't enjoy it much , i was pretty disappointed . just cracked another bottle on a whim ... less pronounced alcohol than in december '07 . 5 months have made a big difference . huge , pillowy malt aroma , with raisins , brown sugar rummy , and walnut nuttiness all swirling about - and sure , some ethanol . a touch of willamette hops maybe ? i should give this a 5 , i 'm not sure why i do n't . this will be amazing in another year . head-retention is impressive for the gravity , with a small foam cover lasting all the way through the glass , with no lacing to speak of . taste is a little flat compared to the aroma , with a harshness from the alcohol . sweet malt , mellow bitterness , and a heavy punch from alcohol in the finish that dries it out a little too quickly . it finishes like a superdry martini , to be honest . mouthfeel is heavy , sticky sweet on the lips . not much carbonation , which is fine , and makes the head-retention even more impressive . drinkability is low . the alcohol detracts from the finish , and it tires a bit . i never get tired of the aroma though . overall , this has improved considerably in only 5 months . it 's worth cracking a bottle now , and tucking a few away in the name of science ."

S'a- pale golden in color , about a 1/2 inch of head , which quickly dissipates . s- smells sweet . very fruity , like black raspberry ice cream . also a hint of hops in the form of a flowery aroma . t- a pretty sweet beer . the blackberry really comes through as the dominant trait . the blackberry fades away after sipping , leaving the taste of the witbier behind . very nice balance of flavor . m- a light beer thats a bit coarse . the carbonation is heavy , but appropriate and welcome in this kind of beer . d- pretty drinkable on the right occasion . this would go well with a thanksgiving meal or a savory dish .'

S"reviewed on paper because the internet was down . the beer had a two-finger light tan head that hardly moved . the body was was a hazy golden-amber , with huge bubbles of carbonation . the nose was filled with a strong fruity , honey , bread aroma , which was a little sharp . the taste had a very roasted ( for an o-fest ) , thick flavor , like heavy bread , with light dosing of citrus . the mouth was fairly thick , too much so , with soft carbonation , despite the appearance . this beer made me grimace - i may have had a bad bottle , so i 'll try to check again ."

S"light gold in color with a fizzy short-lived head . the aroma is pungent and gross skunk ! yuck ! i was hoping i might get a fresh bottle . aroma is telling me obviously not , and you 're an idiot for buying an import that 's in a green bottle again . the skunk is n't anywhere near as strong in the flavor as in the aroma . it 's still drinkable . the pilsener crispness is there with just enough hops for a slightly fun finish . i imagine this beer would taste pretty good and refreshing while fresh . but i doubt most of these green bottles sitting on shelves for months at a time are fresh ."

S"a - hazy orange copper starting to push the tang envelop . a tiny head that disappeared quickly and left no lacing behind . visible carbonation . s - sweet smelling caramel and light malt with a bit of grassy hops . pretty maerzen-like if you ask me . it is n't a strong aroma though . t - it has a very malty taste , yet it is not a sweet as i had expected . the grassy hops make a mild presence , but are a fabulous compliment . the entire taste is masked since the carbonation is so intense . the aftertaste is mostly watery with only a touch of light malt and grassy bitterness . ( edit : i tried to shake this pretty violently to see if with the carbonation lessened , more flavor was there , but the flavor was then found to be rather watery on the whole . the weak flavor is not just a side effect of the carbonation . ) m - very , very harsh on the tongue from high carbonation , but smooth on the throat . pretty thick . only a little refreshing . i slash it here since the mouthfeel masks the flavor . d - i have in the past found over maerzens to be too sweet to have much dirnkability . this one does not have that problem , but the flavor ( which from what i can tell is pretty good ) is masked . this is drinkable , because the high carbonation , decent flavor and mild , yet pleasant , bitterness mesh to make this a beer you throw back for hours . but the carbonation really kills my desire to ever have it again . not an awful beer , but not worth a second try imo ."

S"its possible that this beer gets a bad rap just for being fairly mainstream in canada . i think when reviewing this beer one has to remember that the version of ipa that the north american brewing industry has created is generally a much hoppier and more alcoholic version of the old english style of ipa . so i do n't give this beer bad marks for `` only '' being 5 % abv or not having enough bitterness to destroy my taste buds for the evening . the appearance is pretty damn yellow and pretty damn clear ( as compared to any other ipa i 've seen which is usually reddish-brown ) . white head , with a slight hoppy aroma that for some reason i want to describe as `` creamy '' ... i 've never been good with words : ) . now the last time i had this it was right after a dry stout , and i could easily taste a citrus hop flavour similar to cascade . but thats usually not so prominent . dry aftertaste , lingering bitterness for several minutes . for me , keith 's is a pretty good ol ' standby beer , something to drink on a hot day , or when you just feel like having something you know you like . i like this beer , despite any flack it gets me from fellow beer snobs : ) . cheers"

'' massive banana bread taste , with maple indeed bringing up the rear in the aftertaste . indeed , this is a veritable malt showcase , with bready , banana-rum flavors everywhere . full bodied . this is an intense flavor bomb . so much that i find it really tough to drink that much of it . i want to drink it again ... .and split it with 4 people . it is a bit much for one saison-lover like me to handle . i am finding that this brewery is especially given over to intense flavor bombs ..."

'' a : pours a clear , deep amber color with a finger of off-white head in the snifter . retention is quite amazing , especially for 10 % . the final result is a collar on the brew , with no lacing down the sides . s : molasses , roast , nuts , raisins . as it warms , it quickly starts giving off a rubbery ethanol aroma , and when it really opens up it smells like a dead ringer for solvent . t : when cold ( and i mean cold ) , it 's really not that bad . a nice melange of toasted nuts , raisins , burnt caramel , molasses , and the lightest hint of roast . but again , as it warms up and hits its stride , it becomes _incredibly_ solventy , to the point where i 'm wondering what the point of making this was . did n't they taste this before releasing it ? m : light-bodied , with high carbonation . lots of booze . not even a little shy about 10 % . jeez , try to hide it better . d : no . this is so harsh and solventy . it might age well -- the flavor underneath the booze was pretty solid -- but i have no desire to find out . i do n't have any patience or respect for a booze-bomb ."

S"750ml bottle to wine glass , caged synthetic cork reads 'wn0109 ' after uncorking . $ 17 . indicated on the bottle as an amber wheat ale , special reserve from the brewmaster 's collection . a : witte noire pours with a 1 and a half finger , medium brown creamy head that is fairly fast to diminish . lasting film . the body is a very dark shade of amber-brown with transparency only along the edges . lightly particulate . good lacing initially , but stickiness is lacking , resulting in a glass scantily clad with erratic strings of lace . s : malt head , featuring aromas of grains ( wheat ) plus light chocolate . between toasted and roasted . there is a piney/woodsy scent that nearly goes by unnoticed . pleasant yeast aromas start with leather and ease into dough . refined nose . t : light dark fruit flavors of plum and cherry that are more than likely derived from yeast esters . maybe a hint of strawberry . at just 7.5 % abv , the alcohol is perhaps a touch too noticeable , which starts at the belly and works its way up . m : the mouthfeel extends the flavor duration . the wheat component of the grain bill has a profound impact on the mouthfeel . the body is extra full , creamy , and extremely smooth and supple . effervesence is gentle yet ample enough not to be disappointing , even though i was looking for more crispness at the end , not the astringent finish i experienced . d : overall , a very quality brew . but what was intriguing to me at first , ultimately became tiresome towards the end of the bottle . perfect to share casually among friends ."

S"got this one from ludachris from a trip he made to nova scotia . thanks man appearance : pours with a solid thumb of head that retained decently but did not lace . the beer itself is a a little bit on the yellower side of gold but boasts decent carbonation and good clarity . smell : very muted and watered down but that is good , because all i 'm getting is a white bread smell with a slight acidic touch . taste : if i could give this beer a 2.75 i would , as it 's not bad or offensive , it 's just generic and watered down . it starts with the barest touch of malt , and then turns to a generic bread and corn like taste common of many adjunct and then turns to the barest kick of earthy hops . mouthfeel : well , this beer is smooth although the carbonation is a bit off , and for something so subdued you would n't think it would transition poorly . it does leave a wet feeling in your mouth because it 's watered down . on the plus side though there is no aftertaste , whatsoever . drinkability : simply put , this beer is a guzzler . it 's light on the gut , highly refreshing and goes down smooth . frankly , if you drink it fast enough you can miss the bitter hop kick entirely . i would have no problems polishing off a six pack of these in short order . final thoughts : all in all , a good beer for a hot day of work but not much else . it does n't have that much in the way of character , but as a adjunct i suppose it does it 's job . that being said , there are better hot day beers i 'd rather have then this one ."

S"i spent the night down at the headkeeper for my best buddy 's birthday and picked up a bottle for a nightcap . i have had this fine belgium-style quad before and felt it fitting to offer my humble opinion now . the fine people at the brewery ommegang have really out done themselves with the three philosophers . i truly believe that their beers are very much in sync with their belgium counterparts . the three philosophers poured a deep rusty reddish color , wish a creamy off white head that quickly dissipated . there was no lacing on the inside of the crystal snifter , which has been the medium that i sample all of my beers in . the smell was sweet with hints of sour cherries and yeast . the taste was suburb both hoppy and fruity with a sour finish . this beer is a wonderful american take on a traditional belgium quadruple . i would recommend it to anyone ."

S'indica pours a dark amber color with a tan head that will fade shortly after the pour . lacing is minimul but some hints can be found . the smell at first was of wood and tree sap , then as i swished the beer around hints of citrus and malts arose . taste was very strong but unbelivable , very suprising considering the smell , citrus but strong hops and malts overpower all . feels dangerously evil and full in the mouth , explosive off the tongue . i must say i can only drink about 2 of these at most , very strong and tend to get bitter the more i drank .'

S'pours a copper amber hue , with translucent clarity . three finger head holds very well , even for an ale with lots of hops and leaves good sticky lacing . fruit esters and noble hops in the nose . strong hop bitterness and lingering aftertaste overpower a distant roasted malt flavor . this unbalance hinders the already undercarbonated and medium bodied mouthfeel . even an aggressively hopped apa should feel smooth and dry , but the hop finish turns abrasive and residual .'

S'pours dark like molasses with a rich caramel head - a feast for the eyes . coffee , molasses , prunes are evident in the nose ; it is deep , rich , and complex - abundant in subtle fragrance . the taste is sweet like caramel and molasses , rich and bitter like a good strong coffee , full like a hearty whole grain bread . it also has an earthy , nutty flavor - very excellent . feels wonderful in the mouth - full up front , lighter at the finnish , but with flavor that coats and lasts . a heavy but drinkable beer .'

S"an extremely good chocolate stout . lucky enough to find it on nitro-tap at elmer sudd 's in wilkes-barre , pa . i 've had it out of the 22oz bottle as well . pours midnight black with a good-sized tannish head . smells like pure milk chocolate ... unreal ! mouthfeel and taste are exactly how the good lord envisioned ... very noticeable coffee and milk chocolate overtones . i am a big fan of rogue and this is unquestionably one of their best offerings ... definitely worth a try !"

S"thick white foamy head and very hazy beer . what you should expect from a wheat beer . smell is light , but the corriander spiciness is evident . smooth to drink , and some carbonation , but not too heavy . a decent amountt of spiciness is evident , but not too much . the wheat and grain taste is evident but pleasent . this will probably be a staple in the fridge . i ca n't wait for the summer to have some shelfish and a few of these ."

S"current abv is listed at 4.8 frangelic stout is on a nitro-tap , and the appearance of this beer is excellent ... a thick white head , perfect stout black colouration , very appealing to look at . the smell of this one lets you know that the frangelica is present , because it 's a hazelnut bomb with some slight roasty notes on the side . the flavour is pretty much what one would expect given the components : the backbone of the beer is a smooth , creamy stout with some subdued roast tones , while the frangelica coffee controls most of the flavour with a strong hazelnut tone . i find the pairing enjoyable but not amazing , if you really like hazelnut coffee , this is a must try though . the mouthfeel on this , above average , trending toward good . it 's creamy and full , enjoyable . drinkability is the only place where i really have to knock this beer , and it 's the same reason why i would knock the rating on hazelnut coffee if i was rating coffee at coffeeadvocate.com , it 's abrasive on the stomach and tastebuds if you have more than one . frangelic stout is a nice stout offering by founders . personally , i would never have more than one in an evening , but it 's a good change of pace , and fits the winter months well ."

S"the color is nice , but virtually no head . kinda confused about what number to give this ... the smell has the promised fruit in it ... dark rum , like rum raisins . sweet malt . estery alcohol . sugar and belgian yeast . did they remember the hops ? belgian-ish flavor , yeah , but not top notch really . i 'm getting something almost like that pink bubblegum from it . the rum raisin thing is still going on , with the malt there but in the background . alcohol nose gets quite strong as it gets warmer ; decent for a belgian yeast but not top notch . the alcohol hides much of the malt . hops still mia . mouthfeel could be better , with the stickiness sloshing around in the mouth . the alcohol helps , but still thick in an unpleasant way . i 'd have a lot of trouble drinking several of these in a row . unbalanced but not horrible . like some other stuff from dogfish , quite a unique experience . something to have for a change every once in a while ?"

S"the smell was definitely of the brewing process and not so much of a beery scent , but it had a hint of a different , yeasty aroma . not unpleasant at all . first sip was an eyebrow raiser . the carbonation and taste of beer with a most definite taste of lemonade . succeeding sips after the tastebuds settled in confirmed that the lemonade taste ruled over the beer taste . not thick in the mouth parts at all , but the remnants of the lemonade flavor lingered . quite nice , actually . for now , anyway . more sips , more lemonade . hey , where 's the beer ? it was as if the lemon citrus flavor took over the whole show like that real hammy kid at eighth grade graduation commencement performance . ok , i see where this is going . now , was this concoction brewed for the thirsty , or for the ladies ? i 'd classify this beer as another `` lawnmower '' beer . you 're hot , sweaty , smelly and stinky from cleaning out the septic tank or whatever , and you want to slake your thirst . grab a couple of these guys . they 'll go down just like ... well , like lemonade . you 'll hammer those down and go for the third before your stomach knows it has a visitor . but if you 're chillin ' on a so-so day looking for a good tasting manly beer , pass this one up and grab something else . there are plenty of others to choose from ."

S"a trademark mexican beer with not much to be proud about . it pours , yet again , your average golden tone , even clearer which would make me guess it was rather watery . especially after the mild foam head faded quickly . and guess what ? i was right . this beer has no smell and no taste at all . it is the worst of the light beers . you can throw in a lemon to give it some taste , but you can also do that for a more cheaper edition of `` water '' and have some lemonade . a beer that actually needs help on the taste ."

( okay , i 'm in wi and i have 7 bars in a two block radius . but my favorite bar . ) pours out a dark , dark , brown with decent head retention . very light bodied for a dark beer . prevailing taste is definately the extreme roasted malt . has a coffee flavor too . not bitter at all and quite crisp . this is a dark lager that almost anyone could drink .

S"review taken from vip tasting seminar at the columbus beer fest . after having just tasted the founder 's el diablo del noche i was expecting a lot from stone 's new black ipa . unfortunately the balance and finesse was lacking in this brew . poured very dark like a mocha porter . smelled almost entirely of fresh strong hops . there were the normal oily hop notes and mild citrus aromas of massive amounts of dry hopping . i personally did n't detect any roasted malts here . the taste is of a pure and utter hop bomb . my first thought was - `` my god this is hoppier than ruination ! '' if i remember correctly the stone rep claimed that they do n't like to release the actual number of ibus on this one because once you get to a certain point most palates ca n't tell the difference anyways . in any case , this is to this day the hoppiest beer i have ever tasted . mouthfeel was hot and prickly from the hop bitterness . drinkability was really low . i would struggle through a whole pint of this i fear , and i love ipas . if you want a hop bomb then this beer is for you . if you want something with the complexity that a black ipa would suggest then i would recommend trying something else ."

S"orange glowing body with a bit of a tarnished haze to it , thin and fluffy egg shell colored cap , keeps a fluffy collar ; lacing is in minimal spotting . aroma is bleak if not transparently open and clean , i wiff and wiff and do n't get much of anything . as it warmed some slight toasted husks emerged . perhaps deserving of a lower number then average , but it has no off aromas and is clean so it gets the average . taste is smooth and clean , light caramel malting , a bit of some toasty aspects , crisp and firm in the front , bready and lightly chewy biscuit with caramel/honey edges smooths out a warm and rendered light chewyness in the finish . light leafy/grassy hops play very secondary and kinda mingle into a small section of fruityness in the middle area . feel is firm and smooth , nice little malty chewyness and residual sweeter fruityness across its appealing lighter medium body . this is n't overly flavorful or substantially full in character , but damn if it ai n't drinkable . i could have alot of these , would make for a nice session o-fest brew for sure . thanks to mentor for the cross border exchange !"

S"this beer pours a deep dark mahogany brown with rusted red accents into my chalice . it has a thin tan head that quickly disappeared with little to no lacing to speak of on the glass . the smell is dominated by sweet malt and dark fruits coming through . the scent of alcohol and pineapple is present as well about mid-chalice . sugary malt , pine , dark fruit , and a touch of citrus run across my palate . there is a great deal going on with this beer . rich malted tones and a smoky caramel are the most dominant flavors to me in this beer . i served this beer at cellar temp and still somehow this beer tends to gain more life the warmer it gets . the sweetness of the malt and bitterness of the hops is very well balanced and well made . the taste is in your face the whole time and in no way subtle , but the balance is really a nice surprise . this beer is a very nice sipper and coats the mouth and tongue very well with it 's stickiness . after finishing the bomber i do n't really want another one right now and i would n't drink this beer with a meal most likely . it is very heavy and quite filling . i know the american strong ale category is a bit of made up category to fill a large variety of beers that craft brewers are making , but the flavors on this beer actually reminded me of a good barleywine.all in all great offering ."

S"whew . had this beer out of a bottle , poured into a snifter-style glass and served just below room temperature . appearance : dark and vicious on the pour with a slight , tan head . laces well , much like a stout should , but nothing about the pour or appearance screams anything more than your average imperial stout . smell : whew . big bourbon notes ( although next to black tuesday , i would suppose they 're a little more tame , but then again , what is n't ? ) and then a roasty , toasted malt filled second layer and finishing with a slight chocolate and vanilla , but mostly the bourbon and slight booziness . taste : very complex , and a little sweeter than i was expecting . bourbon is big and thick , with the booziness being quite strong . chocolate and barley are here too , but on a secondary tier from the bourbon start . although this was n't the newest batch of bcs , it 'd probably be just a tad better with another 6 months to a year on it . there are 6 more in the cellar though , and maybe i 'll come back and update upon further review . i mean , i love a good bourbon beer , and when in the mood , this certainly delivers , but i think its strong suit is also what keeps it from being a 5 : it 's a little too much bourbon . hopefully the mellowed sweetness will push that up a bit too , i really do n't doubt it . mouthfeel : ooh , so velvety and smooth . powerful-good thickness and finishes warm . that 13 % is definitely here , no doubt about it . carbonation is spot-on too . drinkability : i feel bad knocking it , but it 's not the most drinkable of beers . the boozy character catches up over the course of the bottle , but the rest of the experience is excellent . drinks like a 13 % , which hey , it is , making it feel pretty average in that department . but for a special occasion , and maybe some chocolate cake , this beer is happiness in a bottle ."

S"on tap at the alewife for the stone total tap takeover on friday 10/1/10 . they had both the 10th anniversary special blend and this ; the `` greg koch 's mad man mix . '' we arrived late and they must have run out of glasses because this was closer to a 10oz pour in a tumbler instead of the advertised 5oz sample pour . this brew pours a very dark brown to black color . when held to the light it has some lighter coloring of brown around the edes . a ring of darkly tan head sits atop this brew hanging close to the sides of the glassware . a light swirl revives the seemingly nonexistent head to about a finger 's strength and then rapidly dissolves . the aroma of this brew initially smells like a blend of milky sweet chocolate and a bunch of mineral quality . as it warms , citrus hops come forward along with a secondary type of aroma that is n't quite hops but is somewhat peppery citrus . the taste is dark and roasty upfront with a bit of malty sweetness . the roasted character is borderline smoked but with a woodsy flavor . the taste fades into a citrus twang that is somewhat mineral-like and includes a type of peppery zip that is almost citrus like but not quite . it is hard to describe , it is similar to a citrus hop component but much more earthy . it is similar to the citrus character that a habanero has right before it overwhelms you with it 's heat . and yes this brew has lots of heat in the finish . there is both the alcohol warmth of this brew and also a peppery spice and warmth that clings to the mouth and continues to warm the mouth/throat long after each sip is swallowed . this is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation . the carb opens up once it hits your tongue and really makes the flavor of the peppery component in this brew go wild . to have it once was a nice treat but the heat and spiced flavor of the pepper was too much for me to enjoy more than one glass ."

S"a : nicely colored tan shade with a quickly dissipating head foam that leaves very little lacing behind . s : very oak/piney smell that leaves a hint of fruit scent behind . feels easy on the nose . t : a very fruity beer , hint of apple and maybe a bit of pear . definitely tastes very solid and does n't leave too much flavor left behind . m : letting this brew sit in your mouth for a few seconds before downing it is really a treat . it flows over your taste buds with heaps of fruity texture and generally leaves you feeling refreshed . d : decent , above-average maybe . can drink the brew constantly if needed be , but do n't desire to since the taste repeatedly strikes the mouth in a good way . overall : very good stuff , much better than i initially expected . do n't know why i came into it with low expectations but it totally showed me up in every aspect . would buy again !"

S"being that this was an english ipa i was n't expecting much of the tastes and smells that i have become accustomed to with the american ipa . i found this to be an easy to drink ipa that does n't come on too strong . pours an amber color that is pushing towards brown . tops off with a 2 finger white head that has great retention and leaves beautiful white lace on the glass . smells are heavily malty and sweet , with only citrus hops coming through . there is also a hint of floral scents in there . it tasted slightly woody but had a tangy sweetness that i could only describe as citrus , mainly oranges . alot of breadiness in here that kind of masks the hop bitterness , followed by some malt sweetness in the aftertaste . mouthfeel was medium-bodied and kind of chewy . very drinkable . not too intense and the alcohol does n't show up in the taste ."

S"poured from a 22oz bomber . appearance- the beer looks almost like grenadine syrup . the head is only a finger 's width . constant lacing throughout drinking session . color is a very deep amber , like a darker amber than my irish next door neighbors hair color . smell- a mix of freshly baking bread and musty hops . taste- reminds me of rye bread without the seeds . a great balance of toasted malts and earthy/musty hop flavors . mouthfeel- great carbonation , and being just shy of 6 % abv , a great session beer . the balance of hops and malts makes this beer so very appealing and easy to drink ."

S"batch 5 , feb 2007 bottle poured into a bruery tulip . yes , this is a 4+ year old dipa . pours a bright orange with a small head that lasts as a small film throughout . smell is n't too good , i get a slight over cooked vegetable smell . some piny hop aroma in the background . taste is nice and subdued , the alcohol is well hidden . obviously the malt is more pronounced with the age . still a decent balance with the hop flavor . not bad for a 4 year old dipa ."

S"hmm . a * poured into a simple pint glass . dark , dark in pour , dark in the cup . zero transperancy . light brown head that dwindles down to nothing across the surface , light stickyness of head wedged in the corner where the beer meets the cup . lacing is thin lines but plentiful all the way around the cup . s * wow . smells wonderful . smells like walking into a fine chocolate shop . dark chocolate , malt , coffee , and molasses . t * i 'm confused here . i do n't pick up any hops in the nose but they are very prominent , almost too bitter for what i 'm prepared for . i am expecting dark chocolate and malt , which are there , but the taste is overwhelmed with hop bitterness , almost soured in combination with the other flavors . reminiscent of old coffee . i 'm wondering if this bottle has been sitting under the lights too long . m * smooth , kinda creamy , over-carbonated . i 'm immediately hit with an odd sour bitterness in the back of my tongue which is throwing off any potential it has for a good creamy mouthfeel . d/overall * i 'm disappointed . i 'm kinda worried this was an old bottle that was sitting for too long . i got it for $ 4.99 which around here is an amazing price for a rogue 22oz , generally they 're $ 6.99 . i will try this again , but not until i find it on tap ."

S'poured out of the 12 oz . bottle , into a proper weizen , glass , the beer looked the part of a proper german wheat beer , with a pale cloudy body , and a good sized head . the head did not last too long at the initial size , but it did leave some nice broken lace behind . the smell was decent , but not quite up to the best beers in this style . all the basic elements like banana , lemon , and clove were there , but the proportion was not quite right , and the intensity was not there . the taste was a more watery than i would have liked . the dilution made the traditional flavors of banana , lemon peel , and clove , a little less delicious . extrapolating how fast i was able to down this 12 oz . bottle , this beer would be easy to drink in large quantity on a summer afternoon . although each gulp would be only a reflection of what a truly good hefeweizen should be .'

S"on tap at the brewpub . served in a nonic imperial pint . enjoyed with fries and chipotle mayo . from the menu : an american pale ale that was brewed with our friends and co-political activists at sun king brewing co. 50 ibu . 5.4 % abv . $ 5 imperial pint . a slightly hazy golden yellow body with a white head of 2 fingers . the lacing is beautiful- thick , sticky , sheets of fine bubbles do n't form rings , they form curtains . glorious . the smell is light malt , kinda toasted bread , perhaps even pilsner malt ? the hops are nice . not mind-blowing like the citra hop hits on zombie dust , but still quite nice . lemon zest , andsrink oranges , and grapefruit . the grapefruit comes though as a huge flavor on the finish , with other citrus notes in the supporting role . the malts are light , just a nice nuance that makes this insanely drinkable . this is another beer from floyds that i could happily kill a growler of . the body is light and well carbed . bright and tasty . it is almost like a cross between osiris pale ale and alpha king ... and it works pretty well ."

S'poured a rich copper ale with a white fluffy head that subsided quickly with no lace . the aroma is next to perfect with a beautiful blend of rich english malt , a fine hop nose , and that distinct english mineral character . the flavor is also good with a sweet malt in the begining which quickly segues into a quick touch of hops and a clean , dry finish . the body is the only flaw i have with this beer as it seems a little bit too light but the carbonation is perfect leaving the beer with very little carbonic bite and a nice pseudo-cask conditioned feel to it . this beer is highly drinkable and i would easilly order a couple pints as it has a very clean finish .'

S'appearance- orangish amber in color with nice tan fluffy head off the pour , small bubbles slowly stream along the glass smell- nice citrus and piney hop nose , also faint malt in that back ground taste- this is a very balanced ipa first and foremost , the hops are there and they are tasty and enjoyable but they never be coming overly crushing and overwhelming , good malty sweetness up front keeps it quite balanced and enjoyable , has pretty enjoyable flavor , overall what i enjoy most about the flavor on this beer is just how balanced and aligned properly the balance of hops and malts are mouthfeel- very smooth with right amount of carbonation and smoth drinkability- this beer is extremely drinkable to me and despite fact its 7.3 percent would make a great session ipa becasue you could so easily drink a few of these and still be wanting another because its just so perfectly balanced , it gives you a good dosage of the hops you want with out choking out your tastebuds and making you have enough , its not the hoppiest but thats not a bad thing and its may not be the most complex ipa i have ever but in terms of drinkablity for they style i think its just about perfect'

S"tannish , amber in color . very highly spiced aroma-just like the label says-sassafras , vanilla etc . it really reminds me of the real thing berlinner weiss i had in germany with woodruff . suprisingly not bad flavor considering the press and reviews . tastes more like a birch beer then a regular beer . spiciness of the herbs and flavors dominate . somewhat medicinal and toothpaste like i have to say . decent enough body . if you take this for what it is , and is supposed to be , it isnt that bad an effort . overall i dont see having more then 1 to try . i bet this gets worse reviews then say , any dfh `` historical '' beers , but again just like a macro or `` bud b to the e '' it needs to be approached in context ."

S"the pour may have been nitro , but this beer took five minutes or more to settle and was like a third of a glass of beer and half head after the first poart of the pour ... totally thick and creamy . the head was ultra brown . thing of beauty . smell was hoppy imperial stout , with that slightly stale aroma i notice in a lot of brooklyn stuff -- floral hops in style , but more of dying flowers . taste was full and similar to the aroma , add a roasty smooth malt flavor that was appealing and very drinkable , but as it warmed the stringing alcohol , and dying flowers poked through . it 's not that the taste was bad , but big beers and stouts , other than alcohol , tend to have the taste ( and score ) bias due to the intensity of flavors compared to paler-malted brews . this does n't mean they taste better , they just stand out more . given the style , the flavor here was on par and average for a typically above-average style . this does not mean it tasted bad , it tasted delicious , it just lacked a certain something to put it over the top in the catergory , flavor wise . mouthfeel was unmistakably full , and points given for the beer-head-mustache i had on the first sip . this beer slammed me on an empty-other-than-peanuts stomach , and i did n't totally realize it was 10 % until too late . half the glass was still full after about ten minutes , but i had to put her down for 20 minutes and sip slowly after that , as i started floating . i 've had better , but this is a good brew . of note , i did n't like it in the bottle when i tried it last year , but i would get this on tap again , despite the generally 'middle of the road ' ratings ."

S"this is a beer that has become available in my local area very recently , and it seems to have a big following nationwide . that in itself leads one to assume the beer 's mildness of flavor is behind its popularity since the general beer drinking public considers it palatable . do n't get me started on the sales of the urine sample labeled bud light . that being said , fellow bas seemed to have ripped stella a new one ( stanley kowalski not withstanding ) . i prefer porters , stouts and ales in general , but have tried to review this lager with the reference of the beer style in mind . it is very mild across the board . it has a mild hoppy finish and is very easy drinking , especially when it 's hot outside . i had several while visiting my brother in charleston sc , and it was hot as hell . i would consider this an upgrade from most macrobrewed domestics with the exception of yuengling . look for big beer taste elsewhere , but when a lake trip requires a better than u.s macro talk to stella . unlike many of my brethren bas i enjoy a walk on the mild side occasionally and stella certainly fit the bill ."

S"if you do n't like the smoky flavor of scotch or irish whisky , or that of smoked meats or cheeses , save this one for those of us who do . pours a orange-tinted amber topped by a just not-quite-white head as you 'd expect from a classic marzen . one has to prepare for the smoky aroma with a hint of malt . it was disconcerting until i thought of the smokiness i 'd expect from a nice single-malt islay scotch or a smoked , dry-aged schwarzwalder ham . with that in mind , the smokiness is a nice rich flavorful smoke that complements the marzen remarkably well . unlike some other flavored beers , this one does not skimp on the base beer . the melanoidin maltiness comes through the cloud of hardwood campfirey smoke and smooths the edges of the smoke and light hop bitterness . the mouthfeel is typical marzen , and while it would otherwise be a dangerously drinkable beer , the smoke flavor would wear out its welcome ."

S"presentation : 25oz . dark green bottle ; no `` bottled on '' or `` best before '' warning on the label ; i know this particular bottle dates to the later part of june 2003 , however , as i witnessed its packaging in person ; purchased for $ 10 directly from the alesmith brewery . appearance : poured a viscous , sludgy black with little in the way of head , carbonation or lacing ; the 4oz . sampler i had on tap down at stone 's 7th anniversary showed a beautiful , cascading , cocoa-brown head with lots of lacing and good to very good retention ; it is upon the latter experience that i have graded this beer 's appearance ; bottled version would merit a 2.5 . nose : largely of chocolate , coffee and sherry -- and all three pungently so . taste : huge notes of sweet chocolate and dark , plum-like fruits upfront ; predominant quality is of a deep , roasty coffee , however ; thick , pleasing bitterness in the finish ; strongly phenolic ; unfortunately , the bottled version 's lack of carbonation created a syrupy , liquer-like effect which was off-putting ; mouthfeel score is again based on the aforementioned 4oz . sampler which was itself a tad thick for my tastes ; bottled version would merit a 1.5 . notes : between the prohibitive $ 9-10 cost , stupor inducing 12 % abv and the above noted carbonation troubles , i will probably never buy this again ; that said , the 4oz . tap sampler i had out in san marcos was downright beautiful and one of the tastiest examples of an imperial stout i have ever had ."

S'this is a pretty good saison / farmhouse ale . pours into a glass , with a nice thick head . lots of carbonation , but almost automatically dissipates . the aroma is funky and grassy , a nice sign of a classic farmhouse ale . the taste is complex with a mixture of horse grass funk and dried citrus . overall this is a good saison , and particularly a good italian rendition . i would recommend this to beer lovers whom want to try something new and different , and even appeals to farmhouse drinkers .'

S"the initial smell was a delicious blend of coffee , chocolate malt , and bourbon . i also really enjoyed the first taste . but overall , i 'm not a big fan of this beer due to its overwhelming bourbon flavor . i 'm sure it 's great if you like bourbon , but i really do n't . it 's a well made beer , but the bourbon flavor is too much for me . the appearance was a beautiful deep tarnished black , however . the mouthfeel was intensely thick . i could never drink more than one of these , and at the price , i probably wo n't be drinking it again ."

S'*place beer was reviewed : au bon vieux temps , b-1000 brussel when i first smelled it , it was totally odourless . but then the first taste . i could remember that every first sip always tasted different with this beer . this time it was like i was having a bite on a piece of iron . very strange , a beer tasting like iron . anyway , it was very hard to distinguish a certain taste and to name the aftertaste as both where gone sooner as they came . i can remember though drinking a lot of them when some friends and i cycled to luxemburg in 2003 and we had the time of our life . stopping at a lot of towns famous for their beers . when we where in luxemburg we had the oportunity to drink diekirch ( also simon , bofferding and mousel ) . at that time we were drinking mostly diekirch . maybe the very hot temperatures and the tough exercise made the beer taste good . i dont know , at that time it tasted very good . i even took home a little barrel . i could conclude by saying that diekirch might not be the best beer in the world . at least its very refreshing during hot sportive summer days ! ut vivat , crescat , floreat !'

S"poured into a nonic . dark clear amber body with a finger of off white head . leaves plenty of lacing behind and very good retention . smells of caramel and toast . a touch of pine . sweet and malty smelling the hops take a decided back seat . the taste is caramel at first then resinous hops , orange rind , the caramel and toffee are always there and come back on the back end . caramel , resin , and toast lingers . the mouthfeel is full bodied with smooth carbonation . the alcohol is pretty well hidden , but there 's still some heat going down . the resin hop flavors become overwhelming and too strong after awhile ."

S"first time in about 20 years that i tried a pbr . ok i drank it out of the can so i ca n't comment on the appearance . i suggest you do the same . and make it ice cold ! i was tired and thirsty after a couple hours of karate class . i sped from class to the evening 's boccie match after changing out of my sweat-drenched clothes . my partner had the foresight to bring some pbr and some sam adam 's offerings . i said i was thirsty and he said `` good , here 's a pbr ... '' it was cold as hell and it went down smooth as hell . a nice light malt/adjunct flavor , no bitter finish and definitely thirst-quenching . i had another before switching to something else . the 30-pack price is unbeatable for a beer that beets miller lite and bud/bud light hands down . i might just stock up on this myself next time i shop for beer ."

S"grabbed this at the `` class six '' store in montgomery al . i do n't think this normally makes it there . pours a really rich , deep brown , but it 's still clearly brown . quite the gusher - i lost some of this one . off white head is really creamy and thick . sweet dried fruity nose . inviting for sure . the taste seems sweet up front , but it 's drier than expected as the sweetness is only on the front of the palate . raisins , semisweet cocoa , a little roastiness , and fresh plums kick in right before a somewhat burnt and hoppy finish . it tastes like it 's missing something at first . as it warms that missing component starts to take on astringency and harshness . overly thick texture keeps the drinking slow . as you work your way down , that thickness can grind on you . not horrible , but not good . finishing a whole bottle is a chore , even if you lose some due to gushing . i ca n't say i 'll ever drink this again . finishing 6 was tough , as i thought this was a variety pack . while this seems good initially ( look/nose ) , it falls apart fast ."

S'now quaffing : left hand imperial stout ~ 650ml pours a thick and extremely dark , ruddy brown with an agressive tan head . rings of lacing all the way down the glass as i progress . the aroma is sweet with hints of cocoa and faint licorice . the taste and mouthfeel is where this beer shines . thick , smooth and creamy with a combination of milk and dark chocolate with just a hint of licorice . as the beer warms hops are detected in the finish , hiding behind the fading chocolate goodness . as the beer nears room temperature , it takes vinous characteristics , dark cherries , acidic , dry finish . there is a slight alcoholic presence in the taste , but it is shadowed by the wonderful symphony of roasted malts . be careful , however as you will be reminded rather quickly of the 10 % abv . overall , the best offering from left hand yet , and a heavyweight contender in the imperial stout category .'

S"a standard fare 'light ' lager offering from the chaps who bring you guinness . harp has a very light gold appearance with a slight head , not much scent to speak of , or flavour for that matter . very 'clean ' taste with nothing to speak of beyond a hint of corn , very straight forward . this is good in that it does n't taste wretched , bad in that it does n't stand out , which is just as much of a death knell for me . mouthfeel is as light as it appears , though drinkability is , like most light beers , quite high . i 'd only have this again in a 'half and half ' ( 1/2 harp with 1/2 guinness stacked on it , you have to have bass/guinness for it to be a 'real ' black and tan ) but it 's not a bad beer , just a little generic ."

S'pours a shade darker than amber with a whispy little head . aroma is of hops , nice citrus piney floral hops . once you smell it you know what you are in for . taste starts off with a little prickly hops on the tongue , melds into a bit of nice malt in the middle , then drys off strong with the cascade hops . mouthfeel is nice with great carbonation keeping the beer from being astringent on the tongue . drinkability -- i could drink this all day no matter the season . one of the benchmarks for american pale ale . for a lot of people i know this is the when all else fails- beer , as it is widely available and often the only craft beer on tap.. this is not a knock because this is a very tasty beer'

S"a : golden orange color , thin but ample amount of head s : this one actually filled the air ( with hop aroma ) , no need to bother with putting your nose up to the glass , although that reveals more detailed aromas . somewhat of a citrus smell , but also pine notes . t : initial sip was a bit bitter , but what ipa is n't when starting a session ? a sweeter ipa than the majority , but sweet in a citrus-like way . this is somewhat confusing because they use columbus and cascade hops , which normally do n't put that taste off so strongly , if at all . cascades definitely gave it a pine undertone . m : smooth but bitter , perfect amount of carbonation for an ipa . d : good all around ipa , very cheap too ( under $ 5 for 22oz ) drank this while brewing a homebrew this past weekend ."

S"i have never seen this beer in socal , and no , this was n't found in socal , but rather santa cruz . 750 ml twist-off bottle , on to the beer : poured into a weizen glass , the beer is a lighter black , not total darkness . ruby brown hues at the edges . there still remains a little bit of tanned white head on top . ( on the second pour , the head is gone and only dots of tan bubbles spot the top . the aroma ... .well first , you get a big whiff of molasses . but underneath that , there 's a squirt of chocolate syrup , which is pleasant . almost like a chocolate stout . decent taste . if the taste was like the smell , i would be happier . a little molasses first , burnt flavors are obvoius . banana emerges here and there . there 's a little vague sweetness , but it 's nowhere to the sweetness you 'd get in a young 's double chocolate stout or mackeson xxx . it feels light , and seems a little overcarbonated . not luscious or creamy the way other sweet stouts have pampered me . the aftertaste is roasted , but with less than pleasant astrignency . when i bought this beer , i was physched to try a beer i 've never seen or had . when i discovered it was made by carlton & united , the same folks who do such masterpieces ( *sarcasm ) as carlton draught and victoria bitter , i shivered . sheaf stout is decent , and it probably is what i could have expected from these guys , and it 's not a life changer in your beer pursuit . but hey , it only cost $ 2.99 ."

S"got this from awyeh as part of our trade ; thanks again luke . vintage : 2011 , bottle 60/225 pours opaque black with a thin layer of tan foam on top that dissipates quickly . leaves no lace whatsoever . lots of tiny bubbles on the sides of the glass . nose is sweet , but only slightly so . definite vanilla up front , but it is soft and tame . a touch of rum behind it , and a faint milk chocolate all throughout . potentially phenomenal blend of aromas , if only it was stronger . it does n't help that no amount of swirling will generate any sort of head to sniff . i only got these once the beer warmed a great deal , and even then it took several sniffs to get anything . vanilla up front on the taste is clean , pure , and sweetened , like icing on a cake or ice cream . rum comes in next , seamlessly taking the baton from vanilla and moving to its own slightly fruity , molasses and cane sugar middle . distinctive rum flavor is present in spades , but at the same time it does n't overpower . i guess the malt profile takes a backseat to all of this , as some chocolate and roasted malts are present , but do n't make a big show . i happen to love the vanilla and rum though , so i 'll give that aspect somewhat of a pass ( even if it happens to be a requirement of the style ) since it is n't cloying at any point . mouthfeel is fluid but syrupy , giving the drinker some of the best of both worlds . no carbonation whatsoever is fine to drink i guess , but i want some to generate head so i can get a better smell of the beer . drinkability is really fantastic for the style , as i found myself taking swig after swig of this . no hint of the abv at all ; even the rum flavors were never offensive . could have used more malts , especially some to bitter the beer up at the end , but perhaps this is exactly what they were going for . whatever the case , i enjoyed it a great deal for what it was and hope to try more traditional jackie o 's brews in the future ( since they 're from my home state and all ) ."

S"this is a 1999 vintage limited edition ! poured into a brandy snifter this beer is extremely rich looking with a powdery tan to off-white head that quickly forms . to accentuate the nuances of this ale i have decided to consume it at room temperature . this day is officially special ! the aromas are of fine aged scotch , fruity sherry and age port come together in the nose with plenty of malt . toffee , burnt sugar , alcohol , and tropical fruit esters are all here and dancing playfully in my nostrils . the first taste is smooth , rich , and sweet . there is not even a touch of hops detected ( as i expected for a 10 year old english barleywine ) . there is white chocolate , cinnamon , spices , ripe fruit , and the richness of a fine artesian dessert . mouthfeel is really rich and velvety until the finish . the finish is really dry . i can tell that before this beer was bottled there was plenty of sugar left over for secondary fermentation in the bottle . the 11.5 % alcohol content is probably low , but who knows . perhaps this `` vintage limited edition '' bottling has taken into account this extra alcohol . drinkablity is great for the style . usually barleywines take me an hour to finish ( with few exceptions ) . i could easily drink this down in a few minutes , but i choose to savor the flavors in this grand beer . if you find this on the shelves you 'd be wise to pick one up . this is one tasty beverage !"

S"0.33l bottle , purchased and consumed in brussels belgium out of a chalice . deep dark/black with reddish mahogany visible at the very top edge . not at all translucent . thin tan head of small bubbles , quickly dissapates . smells of molasses , and barley . flavor has a residual molasses , slight bit of dark chocolate , and a bit of coffee . hard to pin the overall flavor . hops in a long lingering finish . more bitter than a guinness . good full mouth feel , that hits the palette in waves . seems a bit thin , especially considering the color , but not lacking . not a beer i would consider drinking more than one of . i suppose it would be good to fit a niche - like if i was dying for a beer but also really wanted a coffee , and it had to be at exactly the same time . since i ca n't imagine when that would happen , i do n't know that i would reach for it again , given the wealth of other options available . overall a good beer , but likely only to be purchased for visitors who ca n't find it in the us ."

S"after five years of attempts , i finally secured a bottle of the enigmatic dark lord this year , thanks to my friend adrian , and i opened it last night . this will also be my first review for beeradvocate , and i could n't think of a better beer with which to start . a-it looks like your typical high-alcohol russian imperial stout , with very little carbonation or head . s-the smell smacks of charred fruit or english pudding . this is where dl starts to distinguish itself . t-the charred fruit smell segues into similar taste notes of charred fruit . i may have detected a bit of port too . the finish smacks of coffee . m-mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as i expected , certainly not as heavy as the often-used analogy of motor oil . d-while the 13 % alcohol content is not so evident in the tasting , it definitely catches up with you quickly , plus the richness of the taste causes a decreasing rate of enjoyment after the first glass . i drank the entire bomber by myself , and i would n't recommend trying this . overall dark lord was a phenomenal beer . i do n't think it is worthy of traveling across the country for , but few things with that much hype live up to 100 % of it . this is definitely in my top 10 of beers , and i look forward to the next time i can enjoy dark lord ."

S"orange ale may not be the best tasting type of beer out there , but it can sure be refreshing , and that 's what i need right now . 16 ounce tallboy , on to the beer : we 're looking at the leafs changing color ; an autumn orange colored beer with bright yellow hues and solid head retenion . some lacing is left on the glass . the aroma is n't straight-up sweet orange nectar ; it 's more like walking past an orange glove . unripened orange aromas , very floral and very perfumy . this could get interesting . it 's not sweet in slang or being literal . it 's a bomb of bitter orange peel crushing the palate with lots of acidity . my ph balance just shifted three levels over . i can find a whisper of caramel in the aftertaste , but that 's the only `` anything else ? '' i can get . interesting at first , but it becomes unpleasant quickly . the high carbonation does n't help matters either despite a medium body that wants to be creamy . i think buckbean should try to sell this as perfume instead ."

S"appearance : cloudy mustard-to-orange with a positvely billowing frothy , pocked , pillowy head with great retention . eventually implodes , leaving chunks and bergs stuck to the glasswall . carbonation is quite odd ; a bit large , but it also appears to bounce around the glass at angles -- i 've never seen anything like this before . cool . smell : very nice . clovey and spicy , with a big , chewy , overripe banana body , hints of citrus and papery wheat . taste/mouthfeel : wow , this is something . it 's two , two , two beers in one ; pure , dense , sweet spiced banana bread up front , tart refeshing lemon spritzer in the finish . i 've never seen a beer so black and white start versus end . the mouthfeel is ok , thin and a bit sharply carbonated ; think seltzer . drinkability : great . you really can have your cake and drink it too with this one . big ol ' flavor , but cleaned up in the end with hops and lemon . satisfying and refreshing , and a good deal to boot -- what 's not to like ?"

S"i thought this was a decent beer that was easy to drink , but compared to other belgian style christmas ales , i thought this was lacking in flavor . it poured beautifully with a one inch big bubbled head . the body was dark until held up to the light then was reddish and crystal clear . the most dominate flavor was metallic , with chocolate , maltiness , and spices very subdued . alot like their pale ale but darker with a touch of chocolate flavor . a bit thin on mouthfeel with a high carbonation level made it easy to drink . i think i would rather have delerium noel or n'ice chouffe instead ."

S"750ml bottle , courtesy of mikesgroove ( thanks mike ! ) , into a chalice . a - pours a slightly hazy golden yellow . not much head to speak of at all , maybe just a thin ring , with no retention or lacing to speak of ( obviously ) . even at almost room temperature there 's not much of anything . s - bright , fresh apples right off the bat , followed by bready yeast and dried apricots . the brandy comes in late to finish things off , but it 's not too forward . the smell is mouth-watering and inviting to say the least . t - whoa ; the brandy is much stronger than i would 've expected from the nose , while the apples are much further in the background . it 's a little strange , since it 's apple brandy , but they seem to break apart , and the two are n't really integrating together very well with the other elements of the base tripel . the flavors seem to be fighting each other . the booziness also gets in the way and complicates things . disappointing after the great smells coming from the glass . m - medium bodied , slightly sticky , but with nice , effervescent carbonation . o - overall while it 's not a bad smelling beer , it 's not something i would spend the money on again . i was really looking forward to it , since i love apple brandy and tripels , but this one just does n't work for me . if you factor in the price ( i do n't ) , it just gets worse ."

S'appearance - pours a hazy pale orange and yellow . a thick soapy head melts down fairly quickly to a patchy covering , leaving ribbon lace around the glass . aroma - a yeasty , alcoholic candy aroma . rather light all around but pleasant . taste - malty and sweet , some bitter fruits up front . things turned markedly bitter on the swallow as a rush of carbonation fills the mouth . a wash of alcohol heat finishes thing off , leaving the mouth warm with alcohol vapors . a little off-balance but interesting . mouthfeel - slightly heavy , very bubbly . drinkability - intense stuff , but not in the best way . the abv is a little overdone and tries a little too hard to be big .'

S"pours black into the glass with a finger sized amount of head , carbonation clings to the glass if you tip it , but the stout itself does not . it has a very grainy scent , but nothing remarkable . in the mouth a medium bitter slightly coffee tinged tang hits you , as well as the carbonation . unlike most stouts it feels very light in the mouth , watery in comparison to the micros i 'm used to drinking . quite a solid score in the drinkability category for a stout though , the light mouthfeel and easy drinking nature makes this one of the few stouts i 'd consider a 'session ' beer . overall nothing spectacular though , guinness has a reputation mainly because people are n't aware of the vast world of other stouts that exist . not to say that the beer is bad by any stretch , but it 's far from the best as well ."

S"immort ale pours a nice looking mahogany into my duvel tulip , turns ruby if held up to the light . there 's not much of the off white head , and there 's no real lacing to speak of . smell is largely of alcohol , with some maple and vanilla lurking in the background ... this is n't promising . i 'm not usually a huge fan of smoked malts , but they 're welcome here because it 's something that 's not alcoholic heat . as with the nose , the maple and bourbon mentioned on the bottle are ancillary flavors . the beer is nicely carbonated , but the body is a little too thin for such a big beer . any beer this overtly boozy is going to be a slow sipper , and right now i 'm feeling glad that i only picked up one bottle instead of a four pack ."

S"appearance- pours a light head with alright retention . filmy foam leaves a little ring the edge of beer and glass . color was a deep yet clear burnt orange and amber hue . the lacing was moderate , but it was interesting that i could see the lacing from twelve feet away . smell- surprisingly , bananas , sweet bananas and lightly toasted malts . this was not expected at all from any trader joe 's beers or an american amber lager nonetheless . taste- whats even better is that i could taste the bananas as well . i had to take a couple of very analyzing sips . the mix is odd yet very pleasing . bananas and toasted malts gave me the feeling of drinking banana nut bread . mouthfeel- this is pretty light and refreshing beer with such light sugary flavors being thrust on the palate . i do n't know the abv . but i would venture its not over six . by that token , a very good session beer for me ."

S"pours a pleasant , if slightly light yellow gold , cloudy with sediment . head is suitable large , but loose bubbled - leaving it look like soap suds . carbonation is rampant and large . not the best looking hefe i 've ever seen . not much on the nose - a bit of sweetness , a bit of an oily character . but not a hint of the classic banana/clove/bubblegum of the best hefes . very weak . taste is also a bit bland - a light bitter character up front that leads into a gritty yeast character . it 's not bad , albeit missing the true hefe phenols which would be working their way around the sinuses . however , apart from that , the palate is quite hefe like . mouthfeel is a little too carbonated , but the body has a smoothness which is nice . it 's by no means a great hefe , but it 's a pretty drinkable beer . in fairness , this is a style that 's hard to get right , and easy to get wrong . and while they have n't really got it right , they have n't really got it wrong either . very drinkable at least ."

S"amazing , huge , fluffy , foamy nut colored head is sculpted and precariously teetering well out of the rim of the glass . damn thats sexy . the lacing is good , and the beer itself is black with slight ruby tinge , as the name implies . the nose is alcohol , cherry , slight raisin . well crap . for a beer that looks and smells so impressive , i sure was expecting a big taste here . i have been disappointed . perhaps the first thing i notice is the mouthfeel , which is ridiculously thin for a stout , is very carbonated at first , and then totally flat . it is slick also . first taste is definately of red wine . it slowly goes to a snapshot of malt and then a big splash of very typical stout bitterness , with more wine in the finish . this is really a good beer , its appearance and smell just had me expecting something way different from what i got . this is an interesting stout , worth a try , but it has some serious mouthfeel issues in my book and if you 're going to drop 4 bucks on a stout you can really do better ."

S"i think one should first try to figure out what the brewery is going for in a beer . columbus brewing is trying to make a pale ale that converts macro and craft drinkers alike into having this ale as their session choice . it certainly is starting to do that for me . the hops dominate , but not overbearingly . it is not a `` world class '' pale ale like great lakes burning river or even sierra nevada , but when it comes to local columbus brews , it is at the top of its class . sometimes people over emphasize the `` bigness '' of a beer and then review these milder pale ales at a disadvantage . i will not because columbus pale ale does what it sets out to do , and never dissapoints me . drinking local guarantees freshness , availability , and pride in city ."

S'whoa ... this is one epic misfire . pours an almost grape-y purplish red with a large off-white head . the smell gives warning that something is terribly , horribly amiss . there are some vague spicy notes , a bit of unidentifiable sweet fruit-i-ness , and an overpowering miasma of cleaning solvent/nail polish remover . whiskey tango foxtrot ? it was all i could do to get through four or five oz . i like flavor bombs . i seek them out . i crave them . this beer has too much flavor . needs to have the spices and nail polish dialed down by a factor of 90 % . the sad part is the vinegar/tannin/leather notes are almost pleasant , and the fruit-y/sugar-y/lemon-y spiciness might have been good ... if not for that horrible god awful paint removal flavor that throttles everything it touches . a truly epically awful beer .'

S'from a 22 ounce bottle , this brew pours a clear , orange-amber color with a slightly off-white head . it has a mild and mellow aroma of lightly toasted malts and a little alcohol . theres some munich malt smells , but also a little fruit that seems misplaced . its malty and somewhat sweet up front , with more hop presence and bitterness than a traditional octoberfest . at times the beer is reminiscent of an english style barleywine , probably due to the alcohol , but with a decidedly german malt profile . its warming and fairly well balanced . it has a little yeast character and the fruitiness in the smell continues through the beer . i found it enjoyable , but despite the fact that i enjoy high alcohol brews , this one doesnt have exceptional drinkability . it doesnt have the cleanness that i expected . regardless of that , however , the beer is certainly worth trying again .'

S"first review in a while . batch 346/348 a - 750ml poured into my 32oz snifter . cola brown with a 2-finger , creamy , off-white head . held up to the light , the snifter has ruby edges , and it 's quite transparent . i have a feeling that in a smaller glass , it 'd exhibit a beautiful deep amber . s - oh man . it 's been a minute since i had a sour beer . random sour notes , dry oak , cinnamon , spices . rotten crab apples , brett . notes of oud bruin . funky , but not nearly as vinegar driven as the last bdm gr i had . very nice on the nose . t - definitely not as sour as it the nose leads you to believe it 's going to be . rather tame , in fact . tart on the tongue initially and ends in a dry , abrupt , flash . mostly malt-driven up front , and winds down with a lightly-hopped , lightly-funked characteristic that manages to entice you to drink more . m - medium bodied and mild carbonation . by no means flat , just not sparkly . works well with the beer . d - this may be better off split between two people , as it gets a little tiring near the halfway mark . by no means a bad beer , just becomes more of a chore by the last 10 ounces or so . notes : not the best jp offering by any means , and certainly not your typical biere de garde , it ends up being relatively enjoyable ... especially sniffing it ."

S'stopped by british beer company in framingham after dinner on sat 2/20/10 . saw they had a cask of this , and ordered a pint . served in a standard pint glass . dark brown color , medium white head , some lacing . smell was very smoky , like a nice peaty scotch . taste was actually excellent . was like liquid smoke , which is an acquired taste for some beer drinkers . super smoky and peaty , as the description said it was aged on beechwood . moderate mouthfeel , as the cask softened it a bit . only problem that i had with the cask was that i think that the combination of it being served at room temp and the woodiness from the cask made this beer hard for me to stomach , especially after a three course meal and two beers across the street at john harvard . i would have enjoyed this beer a lot more at a different point in the evening .'

S"having only bought one bottle of this beer and not knowing whether to cellar it for a year or drink it right away , i was faced with a bit of a conundrum ... $ 10 and and 16oz later at raleigh times bar and i had my solution . appearance is pitch black ... not oily in appearance like say 10-50 or dl but still pitch black . nice light tan head ... an active looking appearance which is nice for a stout . smell is mostly bourbon and not particularly strong . some vanilla hints in there but for me the bourbon dominates . pleasant enough . taste is dominated by the bourbon , but in a subtle way , if that makes sense . the base beer here feels very simple . not a lot of coffee/chocolate to counteract the bourbon , but the bourbon taste is still not stringent . overall the taste is pleasant but not particularly complex . i get vanilla notes more than anything with the bourbon . mouthfeel is very thin for a ba stout ... . but since the bourbon taste is relatively subtle ( though a little warm in the aftertaste ) , the thin body works relatively well . still , all in all the body is just too thin for a `` big '' stout . in turn though the drinkability is very high . finish is smooth and this is not a hard beer to drink , in particular for a ba beer . problem is that compared to ba beers like kbs or ba sex . choc . ( or even , to a lesser extent , olde rabbits foote ) this beer just feels like a little bit of a notch below . it 's easier to drink than those beers but i do n't want to drink it as much as those beers . still , its an enjoyable beer to drink in total , and i look forward to seeing what a year of aging will do to the bottle i have . if you can get this on draft for a reasonable price go for it , otherwise i 'm not so sure ."

S"grabbed a bunch of this on a recent kenosha run . served in a fobab pint glass . a - a half finger of tannish head that dissipates quickly and leaves next to no lacing . the beer is beautiful transparent maple syrup brown color . s - strong maltiness full of a variety of flavors - apple , maple syrup , berries , plum . there 's a touch of alcohol , but it 's surprisingly minor considering the high abv . t - incredibly smooth , moderate sweetness balanced by nice use of spice . apple cinnamon , toffee , dark fruits , sherry , and a touch of alcohol burn . m - thick , creamy , and smooth , with only a hint of tingly carbonation . leaves quite a bit of residual stickiness and has quite a bit of a warming alcohol sensation . d - i split a 12oz bottle with my wife and that was probably the right serving size . this is a slow sipper and not something you 'd want to session . i ca n't believe they sell this for $ 8 for a 4-pack ! another winner from new glarus !"

S"poured into a new belgium snifter a - mud meets tar , with a tan light and fluffy head , trace lacing s - toasty 'o so toastedness , burned oak , grains , malt and a bit of sweetness t - toasty everything and burned oak . nice hop finish , a bit malty and lots of earth tons , most of which were toasted m - medium/heavy , fluffy carbonated and bitter toasted finish d - because of all the toastedness , it is a bit hard to just session this beer . it tends to end up room temp before you 're done final thought - nice , toasty . this is a great stout , not the best , but great"

S"despite my recent past with this beer . see `` of all the nights '' in the ba talk forum . i have decided to put it behind me and review it . first there is no reason to enjoy this one out of a glass . anyone who says otherwise is a fool . this is a beer to drink , not to enjoy . this is , of course , not to say that this beer does n't have enjoyable aspects , it does . as far as american macros go , i think this is the best , it 's relatively cheap , has a pretty good taste ( aside from the fact you can really taste the rice , which i do n't particularly like ) and you can sit down with your college buddies and polish off a case of it without getting alcohol poisioning . but i digress . nothing about budweiser is impressive . it is what it is , it 's a macro , plain and simple"

S"has to be a the verge of being a pale ale ... ibus have to be low . i will chalk it up as an english style ipa , but still a `` light '' one . pours a deep gold with thin white head . light , almost clean aroma with a very predictable palate . the hops are there , but not near extent i expect from an ipa . very drinkable , a beginner ipa for sure ."

S"22 oz bottle . pours light orange-brown . i had to coax the head of it but it was nice and dense and long lasting after coaxing . flavor is light and lightly fruity . nice ( light ) malt flavor to it . the fruitiness and malt both seem a bit off style ( more so for the malt ) but , you know , it goes down really well ! some bitterness , but it really is , well , light ! this is a very fine thirst-quenching summer ale and i 'd buy and drink it again with that in mind !"

S"beer pours light gold , with a good amount of head and consistent lacing as i drink the beer . hops are clearly the dominant taste and aroma , but much more blah than the regulart harvest ale . no citrus or pine notes are clearly evident . mouthfeel is very creamy , and goes down really smooth , making this a most drinkable beer . very good for a pale ale , but leaves me waiting for fall when the real wet hopped beer comes out . just tried 2010 's batch and it was really tasty . the criticism that i left last year must have been a bad bottle , because the hops stood out on this one , and the drinkability remained great ."

S"cold 12 oz can poured into us pint glass . poors like ... coke ? deep , dark brown , but with a short-lived cappuccino ( ? ) head . aroma of nuts and caramel . very heavy in the mouth . the roasty flavors are n't overly bitter but they are somewhat cloying . it 's not milky or creamy like i really like in a scottish ale , nor is it especially sweet or caramely . it 's definitely an ale and not a stout , but it has the heavy and nutty flavors of an american strong brown ale or stout , at least based on how it froths in the mouth . i do n't get smoke at all . dirty would be putting it better ( or `` earthy '' to be kind ) . it 's pretty fizzy . i wonder what it would be like on nitro . good , falls short of great . i claim to really like scottish ales but too many american attempts fall short of something as simple as belhaven , unfortunately ."

S'for this beer i choose my favorite review glass , a fin du monde tulip . i pour the 500ml bottle into it and it reveals a orange hued copper beer with a medium sized tan head and a lot of stuff floating around in it . the nose is complex and interesting though not entirely pleasant . something in the nose makes me want to smell around it , i will try not to for the sake of the review . up front is dried fruit and grain or bread . i believe the alcohol is what makes me flinch at the smell , and it seems to be dissipating as the beer warms . i have to say that if i came upon this in the wild i would likely let it go as the smell is curious , not inviting . as it has warmed the beer exhibits smells of molasses , coriander and orange peel and the wafting alcohol mellows as does the uninviting overtones . the taste is similarly odd and complex ; sweet , tangy and fruity . i am enjoying how it counterpoises roasted garlic . i am amazed at how the sahti stands up to the potency and still has flavor to offer while the garlic seems to mellow out the off-putting smells and tame the bitterness . the finish is toffee and brown sugar . mouthfeel is medium and carbonation high . i like this beer and intend to make closing notes as a later addition . slainte .'

S'this beer pours a dark brown . pour it gently . the past 2 bottles i have had foamed up very quickly when poured ( both settled and at the right temp. ) . the head leaves moderately heavy lacing on the glass . the smell has hints of fruit flavors . the taste confirms this with plums and figs coming to mind . there are layers of complex flavors to this beer , and a nice balance with the malt and hops . overall an incredible tasting beer . the mouthfeel is smooth as can be with a little alcohol coming through . drinkability is lowered by abv , and the fact that you will go broke if you try to session this stuff . everyone should try this beer if they get a chance . outstanding .'

S"serving : 1 pint .9 ounce bottle this one was a surprise with a huge billowing fluffy off-white head , much more than i expected even with a careful pour . several veins of fine carbonation meander through this ruddy brown brew sustaining a one finger thick head . sour lemon , dry bananas , piquant wheat and sweet malt aromas mingle with a bit of spice and a touch of buttery phenols . all bark and little bite ! malts are the star from start to finish , hints of sour lemon , buttery phenols and dry banana are layered atop the malts with a slight spicy wheat kick on the finish . i was hoping this beer had more to offer , concentrating the non-malt flavors and kicking the wheat shot up a notch would do this beer wonders . mouthfeel is very smooth with a touch of cream on the finish . grip is mediocre , flavor lingers on the palate for about 20 seconds . drinkability is great , off flavors are kept in check and a slick mouthfeel keep me going back to the glass for more . overall , an `` average '' dunkel weizen that can be classified as a well-made , refreshing quaffing beer . cheers !"

S'coopers extra strong vintage ale comes in a vintage looking bottle , and pours a deep mahogany brown , yet cloudy colour with a humongous head that crowns up over the glass without spilling over . the label indicates 7.5 % alcohol and that they achieve it from choice malts and an extended top fermentation . the smell is a combination of aged , toasted malt and the sharpness of alcohol . the first taste to greet you is the sharpness of the high alcohol content . its not particularly well hidden , especially for only being 7.5-percent . the second taste is a toasted malty pseudo-sweetness followed , again , by the alcohol dryness . mouthfeel is quite good , body-wise and carbonation-wise , but post-swallow , the alcohol can get to you . its not as easy-drinking beer as you would hope , and the dryness becomes a bitterness . to sum up , i wont buy this beer again . although it looks pretty nice , and smells pretty good , coopers makes their extra strong vintage ale seem like the 12 % belgian that doesnt balance out the high alcohol content . the only problem is that coopers extra strong is 7.5 % alcohol and does a poor job of balancing it out . all the more disappointing . i adore their sparkling ale and stout , but this beer is not one of their best .'

S"got this 2010 bottle from northsidefred as an excellent extra - cheers ! it pours a rusty shade of brown and is more opaque than clear . the high abv actually becomes visible in a slightly layered effect within the beer . the initial 1/2 finger white head fizzles out immediately to a bit of swirly skim and a few spots of spitty white lace . very interesting aromas in this beer . i do get the syrupy grains and some dark , sticky fruits in the nose , but the dominant scent is specifically the vanilla and oak - not the bourbon - from the bourbon barrel . it gives a really nice , softening effect to the normally nose-singing boldness of a barleywine . the alcohol is actually hardly detectable . alcohol hiding in the nose certainly comes through , almost too strongly , in the taste . it does hold the essence of the bourbon , but the alcohol is definitely more sharp , more like rubbing alcohol , than like the full and softly warming feel of a good bourbon . the vanilla and the oak come through deliciously , with a nice mellow sweetness and charred flavor . as with the nose , i get the barrel a little more than the barleywine , but that 's okay with me in barrel-aged beers even if it is n't others preference . a bit of the deeply caramelized grains and that essence of sticky raisins and prunes comes out in the aftertaste . feel is n't as thick and viscous as it would appear , though is far from thin or bubbly . it has a slick and moderate presence that keeps the flavors hanging around in the aftertaste forever . drinkability is definitely impacted by the sharpness of the alcohol in the taste , but not necessarily any more than in other beers of this style . overall a tasty and somewhat unexpected beer that i 'm glad to have enjoyed ."

S"for this review i had poured a 12 oz . can into a standard pint glass . most of this beer has been consumed straight from the can or a plastic cup . this beer 's appearance from the start was light , pale yellow . it had a lot of carbonation that fizzled at the top , and provided lots of large bubbles . the beer had a small 1 finger had that dissappeared with an angry crackling sound . the smell was also sub par . the smell was very metallic , followed by small amounts of corn , and barley . over all not the most appealing beer . the taste is plain awful . it reminded me of pennies and other various change ( reviewing this from times i have played quarters at the bar and left one in long enough for other ) . there is small amounts of barely and plenty of water to back it up . the mouthfeel is like anyother standard adjunct lager , but due to the taste , i did n't want to have this one around the mouth very long . the drinkability however is solid . these go down quite easily ( but drinking a couple while sitting down is near impossible ) . i would definitely say for parties this is the cheap easy way to go . final thoughts - this beer has to be the worst to sit down and drink one of . not comparing it to other more flavorful beers , it is still difficult to drink compared to other light adjunct lagers . this is a cheap party beer . college students are saved by this beer and it certainly has its place in drinking games to get people drunk . in any other sense of the beer world , natural light is not worth it . strapped for cash and need a cheap drinking beer ( busch light is the same price in bottles ) . go for that instead ."

S"easy to drink but nothing special . its cheap , quenches your thirst , and is easily sessionable . golden body with a short lived fizzy head . smells of sweet corn cooked down but not overbearing . goes down incredibly smooth , does the job for the summer but as fall has arrived it wo n't stand up . i 'll buy it if its on a ridiculous sale but there are better alternatives in the macro world that are better and usually cheaper ."

S"a : this was my third time drinking this and i 'd yet to actually get a good idea about what it looks like until now . the brown bottle gives it a darker yellow hue so i was definitely surprised to find it has a pale yellow color , not too unlike a belgian white . s : the smell is what first attracted me , as a fairly young and new beer drinker , the reminiscent scent of watermelon candies was a pleasant one . the only drawback is that after the second and third time trying this beer , the smell of jolly rancher 's is n't as novel as it was the first time , it gets a little tiring . t : in contrast to the strong smell , the watermelon taste is light and leaves a faint but not overwhelming aftertaste of sweet and sour . unlike some of the more fruity or commonly `` girly '' drinks , there 's a good balance between the fruit and the average ale taste . the taste seems to get sweeter towards the middle of the bottle making for an overall pleasant drinking experience . m : the carbonation initially comes on strong and then fades almost instantly . if it were n't for the alcohol content i might confuse it for a weak flavored watermelon soda . it has almost all of the trademarks of the average summer beer that i can see enjoying on a hot day . still , nothing too remarkable about it , it 's a little above average . d : refreshing and light . unlike some beers i 've had in the past i actually feel like i 've had my thirst quenched . definitely a slow drinking experience though due to the taste and carbonation making it impossible to chug it down comfortably . i think for the price ( $ 8 for 6 pck . ) it 's worth trying . definitely not my favorite beer i 've had , but on a hot summer day i can see stocking up on this for a summer bbq or just a relaxing night in front of the tv ."

S"pch mortel pours an inky black that does n't allow a bit of light to pass through , opaque even when held up to the light . the small brown head fades at first but comes back to maintain a nice thin frothy layer on top of the beer . the aroma is a first sweet dark and roasted malt that quickly gives way to rich oily coffee . there is just a hint of damp , stale coffee as well . like the aroma , the flavor leads with sweet chocolatey dark malt but it quickly gives way to strong dark coffee . the crystal sweetness comes through again in the finish , but rich coffee lingers in the finish . there is just enough bitterness from the coffee and hops combined but no hop flavor to speak of . the alcohol is hidden but the sweetness shows the beer 's strength and makes it a sipper for sure ."

S"purchased from a fine shop in hull quebec . pours a golden honey with soft and plentiful head . smell - smells exactly like a chardonnay wine . if this was a blind tasting , i 'd have thought it was a sweet white wine . slight pear with sweet fermented grapes . taste - fascinating development of flavors . it hits the tongue as a sweet white wine with strong pear and apple flavors then quickly develops into a malty beer filled with cloves and cardamom . as the spice leaves the strong bitterness from lemony hops develops . my only critique is the bitterness builds a bit to strong and seems to overpower the finish . nevertheless , like many quebec beers , a fantastic brew ."

S"the color of the beer is nearly identical to that of the glass bottle , a dark brownish-amber . a finger of beige-colored head forms and sustains nicely . smoke is n't subtle on the nose ; this is an aggressively smoky , almost meaty smelling beer . campfire-like , it reminds me of meat grilling over a wood fire . there 's a solid malt character beneath the smoke , semi-sweet , and a slight mineral/metallic twang . the palate is more balanced than the aroma , initially at least , exhibiting a rich caramelized and toasted malt character that segues into intense smoke and wood flavors . it 's a bit metallic , though that 's quickly washed away by lingering smoke , which clings to the palate in the finish , eventually melding with the mild hop bitterness . i can understand why this beer is so revered , but it 's not something i can drink a lot of . in small quantities it 's very enjoyable ."

S"12oz bottle from a mixed 12pack from market basket . pours an almost opaque black with few ruby-red highlights and a quarter inch of light tan head . smells strongly of chocolate malt ( not chocolate ) , reminiscent of espresso beans . espressso beans dominate the flavor as well with a malty sweetness . flavor actually reminds me a lot of a less alcoholic kahlua . very similar to kahlua , which does n't bother me since i really like kahlua . medium in body with ample carbonation . not the most drinkable beer in the world , though it was n't much work to finish the glass . a unique interesting beer unlike any i 've had . perhaps a more fitting name would be 'coffee stout ' rather than a chocolate stout , though i understand the name . glad i tried it , definitely worth a try . i may try cooking with this one too - i think it may add a unique pleasant character to a chocolate pudding or brownies ( see saunders ' 'best of american beer and food ' to see what i mean ) . not a bad beer overall ."

S"poured from a 750ml bottle into a goblet . formed a small white foam head with little carbonation . color was a light golden with great citrus smell and flavor . this beer was brewed `` by the master crafstmen in the classic belgian `` tripel '' style '' . a little lighter in body than most of the other tripels i have had , which increased its drinkability . drank very well and left a pleasant after-taste ."

S"i have grown up on this stuff so i finally decided to review . unfortunately , after having many craft brews this is a step lower than i thought when doing an actual review . a - beautiful golden brown s - skunky - perhaps some light got in here but i do n't think this is atypical for this beer . got some malt coming through too . t - skunk , malt , and some sweetness but hard to discern what that was m - average - light carbonation d - this is the highest part of this . definately co9uld have a few of these and have in the past"

S'good beer , good lager , very tasty , the bottle is very heavy in weight for some reason not sure why the glass seems thicker , not that that has anything to do with the taste but interesting none the less . we drank this in a glass from the bottle , very crisp taste , good outdoor hot weather beer . the taste and mouthfeel were better than the average appearance and drinkability , maybe can have two at a time not a big session beer . i would buy again .'

S"de dolle dulle teve special reserva 12 oz bottle moderate pour in a tulip glass . bottled 2005 , enjoyed 05/07 . poured a hazy amber with a big fizzy white somewhat diminishing head . smelt of tres strong apple cider , sherry , biscuity malt , butterscotch . it 's kind of like a caramel apple in a way . flavor was upfront strong sherry and apple cider bitterness and moderate sweet bread and caramel and sour apple followed by a strong bitter woody taste ( oak ? ) and pungent mossy mushroomy smell with light sweet and sour apple compote with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg and allspice on a long palate was medium bodied , oily , scarce but stinging carbonation , strongly alcoholic and moderately astringent . overall , the odor took over the room when i poured it . awesome . once you get past the alcohol , flavors were intense and jammed packed with beautiful complex flavors . a good marriage of strong cider and malt flavors ."

S"pours a cloudy amber/golden color with a small whitish tan head . was served too cold and took some warming to bring out much in the aroma at all . when it did come about , it was minimal generic hops . the taste was pretty smooth , but lacking much in the hops department . this beer did not have the requisite hoppiness to make me think it should be called an ipa , and is less hoppy than some pale ales . pretty disappointing for someone who likes hops . this might be a beer i give to someone as the very first ipa they have to get used to a little bit of bitterness . the mouthfeel seemed fine and the beer was appropriately carbonated . this beer is pretty drinkable as it finishes very clean and without any bitterness . in general , i am not a big fan of this beer because it does n't satisfy my desire for an ipa to be at least somewhat hoppy , and as such , does n't seem to fit what i am accustomed to the style being ."

S'live review . poured from the red wax dipped 12 oz . bottle that i bought for $ 7.99 from world wines & liquor in mentor , ohio a few weeks ago into my orval silver rimmed chalice . a all too brief but great looking medium brown head ( it lasted about 5 seconds ) which then dissipated into a single row of bubbles around the top of the glass . all of that over an absolute black body that lets no light through even in front of direct light . at least a good look and although i am aware that the elevated abv of 12 % would probably not be conducive to a long lasting head i really wanted it to stick around because it looked so cool . anyway , the look is a good one for the style . 4.0 s certainly sweet bourbon notes rise up from the now headless beer . dark roast malt appears behind the sweet bourbon smells . i really like the smell of this beer . 4.5 t really very smooth if somewhat boozy taste of very sweet bourbon with an oaken nature to it . it reminds me of some of the higher rated bourbon barrel aged stouts and that should be taken as a compliment for sure . i think that i really like the choice of a porter ( instead of the more typical stout ) since a porter is more able to be influenced by the bourbon taste . in other words , the influence of the bourbon barrels comes through better with this style . that brings to mind one of my all time favorite beers which is also bourbon barrel aged but is also not a stout , the sublime allagash curieux which started out as a triple . 4.5 m appropriately big and smooth and again the choice of a porter really lets the bourbon feel comes though . 4.0 d not that great since it is such a big beer , it is pretty darned expensive and it really demands ones attention . it is not meant to be drank repeatedly anyhow . 3.0 overall : a nicely crafted ba porter that is worthy of a try by any beeradvocate .'

S'poured into a goblet , a very thick dark brown with virtually no head . smell was very intense- dark fruit , brown sugar , chocolate- and the whole show has some kind of phenolic character to it . smell suggests this stout will be richer than it is complex , not in a bad way . sweet . very sweet . there are some rich chocolate flavours and a roast coffee character in there somewhere , but they are overwhelmed by the almost port like sweetness . this is followed by an espresso bitterness . mouthfeel is full and sticky and lightly carbonated . works for me . a little dissappointed , as this is one very expensive beer here and i was hoping for something a little more ... exceptional . the sweetness is what ruined it for me . i could notice some very appealing characteristics in the beer but my palate was overloaded by that one aspect . the bitterness cut things up but it still seemed out of balance . this also made it less drinkable for me . saying all this i will buy it one more time and cellar it for a while . i can see how this beer could change completely with some ageing .'

S"after coming up empty handed in my search for this brew , i was delighted that greg at the trion had secured a few for his frequent customers to try . poured an intimidating dark red , almost black with a milky chocolate head that retained forever . aroma was bourbon , coffee , chocolate and roast malts and it was good . same with the taste , this is a monster of a beer . dense and chewy , with all those stout flavors amped up to an incredible level . as it warmed the tastes continued to change with coffee , bourbon , and the malts being front and center at different times during the experience . it was a little sweet and i ca n't imagine having more then one of these . honestly , to me , i like the founders breakfast stout a little better , just because i find it more drinkable . if i had to have just one more sip of a founders stout , this would be the one , but if i was to have one to go back to over and over again , the breakfast stout would take the day ."

S"i 'm proud to say that this beer will be my first review . i had this on 2/10/2010 at the trappist as a part of russian river night . poured into a russian river stemmed glass . from notes . a : pours a glowing opaque orange with a quickly dissipating one-finger head , leaving some beautiful lacing . s : this was amazing . grapefruit , orange , pineapple , flowers , pine cones , and a hint of weed/cannabis . no malt aromas whatsoever . t : wow . just utter bliss . big , bold , and fresh grapefruit and pine hops dancing together on the tongue . other secondary citrus flavors looming in the background , but the grapefruit is the star . the bitterness is there , but it 's not astringent at all . very subtle honey and bready notes . the 11 % abv is virtually undetectable . m : light to medium body . a bit sticky and unctuous . d : had to take marks off for this . as incredible as pty was , its just not something i could have all night . two was plenty . i hate to lap up all the hype , but this is the best dipa ( or tipa ? ) i 've ever had . the whole experience was exemplary . for all the boldness ( and occasional one-dimensionality ) usually associated with dipas , this beer had remarkable nuance and depth of character . it transcends the limitations of its style to something greater and immortal . one of the best libations to ever grace my palate ."

S"13 % abv . best by 28.05.04 marked on the 8.4 oz bottle . pours a pale amber with an off-white head . aroma consists of apricot and yeast . mouthfeel is thin to medium in body . taste is harsh and oddly flavored . the alcohol is so dominant , unbalanced and overpowering that it kills any flavor subtleties that this beer might have . from what i could pull out it , there seems to be an alcohol sloshed fruitiness , oak ( at times ) , grain and some stomped out caramel malt . alcohol warms the back of the throat and chest as it goes down . it 's not surprising that a beer that so prominently advertises its 13 % abv on the neck and bottle label is all about one thing- the alcohol . is the abv here a selling gimmick ? to me this beer has little appeal and is totally lacking in the flavor department ."

S"incidently , i do n't think i 'll ever have a raftmans again . this beer prides itself as a working mans beer - '' brewed in memory of those bygone masters of the forest who were always amedable to settling their differences over a beer and a shot of whiskey . '' up front were strong tones of bannana and cider with a crisp nasal burn from the whiskey malt . now , i had mine from the bottle behind the raildoad yard , but out of a glass it pours a thick amber hue , very cloudy with very little carbonation minus an 1 1/4 '' frothy head with hints of wheat . here you can feel the carbonation , although unseen - it actually burned my top lip as i then tasted the banana cidery whiskey light wheat beer . now since this baby is fermented on its yeast base with strong sediment on the bottom , this little fellar is destined for a glass - i drank mine out of the bottle after a two and half hour ride in a skidsteer . yes after a 20 hour shift , at five o clock in the morning ( now that this *beer was shaken up good ) i had me bannana apple bran muffin beer . pft ! this thing belongs on a coffee time breakfast menu - `` sir we have a bannana apple bran muffin ... . '' '' oh that sounds good ... . '' '' ... beer , would you like one '' '' what ? f___ you ! just imagine looking into the back of your fridge after coming home from work or watching the game and seeing that name on a bottle staring right back at you . bannana apple bran muffin beer - the only thing missing from that handle would have to be either `` daves '' or `` petes wicked '' written in front of it . all this clocking in at 5.5 % - now what the am i supposed to accomplish with that ? sure if this thing came in 1.18 litre bottle with an oversized screw top and clocked in at maybe 14.6 or something like that , then maybe i would n't be so peeved . but , the alcohol content was the nailing in the coffin - definatly my second peeve after the taste issue . now what 'working man ' coming off more than a fulls day work , crawls out of a piece of heavy machinery , takes a walk down to the railroad bar and says : '' barkeep , make mine a bannana apple bran muffin beer please ... . '' not this camper , and i 've tried it out of the glass too . make mine a shclitz strong please ."

S"this beer poured a hazy orange body with a small white head . nose is floral with loads of fresh root ginger . rather medicinal with mild notes of honey . reminds me sort of a belgian golden ale with an overload of ginger . light to medium bodied with a very floral , ginger quality that attacks at first , then mellows out , but ends with a long lingering ginger taste . a decent malt base , with an even bitterness that balances well . some floral and lemon zest notes appear . there 's a nice honey slickness taste that compliments the ginger well . overall though the ginger is very overpowering and does n't balance well . ginger honey ale . yup , that about sums it up . unlike a soda ginger ale , or even the mixed dark and stormy drink , this is pure ginger . it 's almost like you 're chewing on a raw root of ginger . it 's actually rather nasty tasting . it 's definitely not false advertising , but it just feels like a n ale focusing on ginger could have been more , drinkable ."

S"poured from a bomber into a pint glass , the beer pours a dark , crystal clear , amber-brown color with a thin , sparse covering of film instead of head . the beer definitely hits the nose with sour on the forefront , followed by some dark fruit smells , as well . the beer is sour on the forefront when it hits your tongue , followed by a very brief hit of dark caramel-malty flavors , then quickly back to the sour . in between the sours , there also seems to be a flash of chocolate flavoring . the sours in this beer pucker the mouth , but amazingly do n't linger long after you swallow . the aftertaste is all sour , but again , leaves the mouth quickly . a surprisingly smooth finish for such a sour , puckering , jaw clenching flavor . tasty beer , but the overpowering flavors make this a tough one to drink en masse ."

S"this is `` just another '' pale ale . pours to a clear coppery color with a good amount of carbonation and a thin but stable white head . the smell is kind of weak . has a small bready malt aroma to it , but nothing huge . to my disappointment , i could n't smell any of the amarillo , which is my most favorite aromatic hop . the taste is sweet with a light touch of caramel . the hops are more apparent in the flavor than the nose , but still do n't quite meet up to my expectations of the beauty of the amarillo . has a light bitter and citric aftertaste . not quite as light and refreshing as i was hoping for a summer seasonal pale ale hopped with amarillo ( see 3f 's gumballhead wheat ale , for instance ) . the mouthfeel is medium bodied with a pleasant bitterness . maybe too bitter and dry for what a summer seasonal should be , but for judging strictly as a pale ale , it 's good . not nearly on the level of drinkability as something such as snpa , however ."

S"a thin , pale , lagerish ale . clear gold with good head and lace , mild aroma of malts and bread crust . generally sweet bready , caramel malts lead the way here , with a very light trace of hops near the finish . hops are so mild it 's hard to believe this is a west coast pale . this is the kind of beer you could drink all night when you 'd rather be paying attention to the conversation with your buddies than focusing on what you 're drinking . i ca n't think of a pale ale as easy to drink as this , and that more than makes up for the `` lightness '' of the brew ."

S"poured from a 24 oz can into a glass . has a near-transparent color with a tall head that dissolves quickly into slight lacing . smell is fresh but weak , and there seems to be a bit of corn present . the taste is very plain , and the fact that it tastes a lot like water probably has to do with the fact that it is not much thicker . grains and mild hop flavoring present in the taste . still , drinks smooth with noticeably less carbonation than miller high life , a good thing , although i do think miller high life has more flavor . i give this an above average drinkability rating because , among the cheap beers , this really is n't a bad choice at all . still , not miller 's best beer ."

S'served on-tap at the flying sauce in raleigh . whether this was an american pale ale or a belgian pale ale as i was told it was a tad off for either style . not a whole lot in the way of hops . poured a very pale gold . no head but that was because of a bad pour that i witnessed . however , there was also not a whole lot of carbonation going on either . nose was more sweet malts than anything else . if this is an apa , where are the hops ? if this is belgian pa , where are the traditional hops/sugars ? very underwhelming . at first i thought the wrong yeast was used for this malt/hop bill and should have been made into a kolsch instead . it would make a very nice kolsch i think . but as a pa of any sort there is a whole lot missing . it is very drinkable though because there are no strong flavors and with this abv it would make a nice session beer . i would probably order this beer but as for a representative of any pa style it is a miss .'

S"another stout today , so awesome ! pours inky dark black , a small finger of dark tan head dissipates into a tiny rim of foam , not much lacing . aromas are alternately sweet , then dry . lots of dark chocolate notes as would be expected . some hints of spiciness is in there , too . maybe clove and licorice . not super exciting so far , but good . flavor is very unique . super robust , very tangy right upfront . lots of sweet chocolate malt , roasty roast-o goodness provides a sharp tang . this melds into a middle that strikes me as sweet , but only for an instant . this rides a nice long wave into what appears to be hershey 's hot cocoa mix . mouth is wonderfully creamy and velvety . finish is also super long and breaks into some hoppy hop bitterness and some of the cocoa notes . great , complex and unique flavors roll around in this and the 10 % abv is wonderfully masked . probably expensive , but this was a trade so i have no idea . i 'll assume middle range price . not sure you could sit through more than two of these as it is such a rich brew , but i would try on turkey day while watching football . i 'll bet this tastes awesome with pecan pie , or even pumpkin pie/cheescake . what i like most : the beautiful , unique and complex flavor profile . what i like least : the average pour and appearance . verdict : awesome , robust unique ale . must find if you can ."

S"appearance - a decent enough pour , an inviting hearty amber with a reddish hue . i 'm trying to get some amount of head , but what little i can muster is momentary . no retention , no stick . aroma - grain , slightly fruity with a coconut/chocolate aroma , not very prominent though . an underlying booziness , too . additional input from the malt as it sets up , imparting some roastiness . much better cocoa presence too , give it a minute or two to fully bloom . taste - good roasted flavor , though a little blah on the actual grain taste . they somehow managed to incorporate some macro grain flavor in , and it weakens the overall flavor . chocolate tastes like tootsie roll . not a *bad* thing but makes it hard to take this beer very seriously . the alcohol is woven in fairly well , doing the flavors good with some needed enhancement without being oppressive . ends with some fading roastiness and mellow booziness . overall , the flavor is hampered by a degree of thinness but the taste earns some genuine merit . a superior lager ? not in my book . again , as with the vanilla , there is no hop presence in this beer . it is incomplete in that regard , so i 'll have to reserve top marks for a more complete brew . mouthfeel - i can allow for a bit of thinness in the body , a lager does n't have to be excessively thick . it 's to the thin side , but for the style it 's in the ballpark . good smoothness , a little under-carbonated but overall it 'll do . drinkability - i think this beer accomplishes what it intended . i prefer it to the vanilla but only worth trying for posterity 's sake ."

S"a cheap , light golden colored lager beer from wisconsin that comes in returnable bottles . ( this is n't a bad thing . ) pours with a lively carbonation which settles to a thin collar of foam . neutral aroma . nice mouthfeel for a light lager , but with a lasting almost over-carbonated character . fairly neutral tasting with just a hint of graininess and hops . a beer that is clean tasting and dry enough to be rather pleasant and quite drinkable ! pretty darn good for $ 12 a case and the thick returnable bottles are great for filling with homebrew . the red and white label is classic !"

S'i recently thought about the idea of toning down the bold new belgian ipa style to a belgian apa . i think weyerbacher had the same idea , and zotten is the result , as it is not consistent with the classic bpa style . overall , it was very successful , but there was a pervasive grassy sort of bitterness in the flavor that really hurt the brew ( especially its drinkability ) . i think maybe the hops variety used and/or how much is used for bittering should be re-evaluated for this beer , as it otherwise has potential to be excellent .'

S"shared with my good friend , bassist , and fellow ba dvelcich , who gave a right-proper pour from the bottle into two pint glasses . i believe we were enjoying a 2010 , as our trooper was wearing a groucho marx-esque big-nose-and-glasses disguise . ( george lucas ' empire strikes back ) upon pouring , trooper was black and impenetrable with a robust , 2 finger head which slowly lapsed into thick , dark brown lacing around the glass , even while retaining a more pronounced head the in the center away from the glass . beautiful black body with a creamy , medium-deep brown head . my nose agreed with my eyes , detecting a thick , roasted dark chocolate smell masking a bit of an alcoholic scent that finished with a mildly sweetish hop aroma as i exhaled . deliciously dark flavor . the hops mingle well with the roasted barley/coffee/dark chocolate flavors . hops are actually surprisingly up-front in the mix , for such a heavy , dark beer . a pleasant , roasted flavor in the back of the throat . beautiful , creamy mouthfeel with a nicely warming bite on the tongue . it 's as drinkable as any other russian imperial stout . although it my be a little heavy duty to drink all night long , i sure would n't mind trying ."

S"it just would n't feel right if i did n't review the `` king of beers . '' pours a grainy gold with over the top carbonation , no lace and a miniscule head . bud 's strong suit has never been its look . smell is rather faint . corn , grain and tinfoil are the first things that come to mind . i 'll give it credit for being less offensive than most of its type and i think the rice helps the aroma a bit . taste is buttery with canned corn and a light malt as backup . conclusion is a little creamy , which may be due to the rice . it 's really not too bad flavor wise and it 's certainly one of the better macro lagers . mouthfeel is smooth until a mild burst of bitterness shows up in the conclusion . the lively carbonation or the rice may be responsible for some of the bite . let 's be honest with ourselves here , this is n't beer genius . however , it is dependable and it certainly blows most of its brethren out of the water . if you 're stuck at a party with no craft brew in sight , this is your back up ."

S"presentation : 375 ml corked and caged bottle that i shared with a friend . served chilled and poured into a sam adams perfect pint glass . 2010 vintage . thanks to buzbuzzer for this . appearance : cloudy dark brown in color with some reddish highlights . not much head at all on the pour . aroma : the red wine is really assertive , especially here . i 'm not sure if its the barrels or the combination of fruit and dark ale , but i definitely get a strong pinot noir note . tart cherries , molasses , raisans , and a touch of bourbon heat are definitely noticable here as well . nicely complex and even some balance . taste : again , big wine notes off the top . oak and pinot noir dominate . the cherries add a nice fruitines then meld into a nice sour component . some funk here as well . among all this , there are still notes of a good quad floating in and out . molasses and dark fruits add a nice sweet component . the bourbon really only presents in some heat . i think a little age on this might have improved the balance significantly and allowed the bourbon to shine more . at the same time , i think the fruit might have faded a bit and i really enjoyed the fresh cherry flavors . mouthfeel : full bodied , but perhaps a little undercarbonated . not a flat mess like a couple of lost abbey beers i 've had though . drinkability : at this stage , this beer is pretty hot . even with some age though , i have to imagine this is meant to sip . overall , a really interesting , unique , complex beer that i enjoyed for the most part . definitely has its flaws but certainly worth trying . the sour component works well with the quad and the cherries are very nice . i would love to try an older vintage of this sometime to see how it evolves over a couple years ."

S"poured at about cellar temperature into a red wine glass . i know , i know . i should do dishes *before* drinking . too late , it 's poured . having read the previous reviews , of course without absorbing any prejudice whatsoever , i tried the hard pour down the middle ; i think the carbonation problem mentioned in many previous reviews has either been corrected in this batch ( laid down either in '06 or '07 ) or my bottle has by some miracle been stored with more care than those of other reviewers . i 'm more inclined to believe the former . anyway , my high gravity pour produced a thick , light brown head with an aggregate of bubble sizes and something of a gelatinous look -- it jiggles when shaken . the foam still blankets the top even as i let it sit too long while i type . oh , and it 's chunky . when left to settle , a spattering of little light brown bits appears on the bottom of the dark brown liquid , leaving it to look a bit like the fading edges of last year 's cheap easter chocolate . it smells sour , alcoholic , and fruity . i wonder if it would be a good base for one of those beer shampoos ? like any barleywine , it 's an acquired taste . first , it makes one flinch . then , it makes one want to try another sip . the bitterness and thick , smooth mouthfeel mask the alcohol , while the sweet and sour promised by the smell are delivered in job lots . it leaves a sour , somewhat metallic aftertaste not unlike that experienced with an earthy , tannic red wine . again , like most barleywines , this is not a session beer . the unpublished abv can sneak up on you , and three bottles in a sitting at high altitude are apt to make you think you 're a far better hiker than you actually are ... overall , i would recommend this to any barleywine drinker . if you do n't like it at first , try it again in a couple of months and see if it 's grown on you like it has on me . i would also recommend that any who 've tried it in the past ( especially before '06 ) give it another shot . the carbonation seems to have improved since then , though i ca n't say for sure that anything else has ."

S"a- beautiful color , a bright reddish orange when back lit , hazy and appealing , with a creamy beige head that possesses remarkable retention abilities for such a big barleywine . rings of lace slide away leaving spots behind and forming a negative silhouette of mountainous peaks rising behind this thick lake of danger . s- crazy hops , hop on board the mothership , pine and grapefruit , and a big whiff of alcohol , even when it 's still rather cold . orange , tangerine , pineapple , passionfruit , and a good amount of brown sugar and honey sweet malt although it is overwhelmed by the monster hops . some caramel and toffee , sandalwood , cognac , milk chocolate , and a creaminess as it warms up some . also as it warms , the malt sweetness opens up and competes with the hops , achieving a sublime balance and at the same time ( thankfully ) suppressing the alcohol esters . t- sweet and malty up front with a huge hop explosion on the backside . woodsy and earthy with a caramel sweetness that is overtaken mid way by the hops . tons of pine and grapefruit and the other aforementioned fruits all slathered in a bath of bitterness and vodka like sweet alcohol , almost dank and musty , but in a very good way . flavors of earth and soil , stone , grain husk , grain meat , sherry , pork , and plenty of herbal and burnt fruit flavors from the hops . i could n't guess what varieties are in here but i would compare the flavor profile to centennial , amarillo , and simcoe . insane bitterness mellows out quickly , allowing for a nice balanced finish of toasted grain , burnt grapefruit , and pine resin . mf- full and lush , like as good as any single malt scotch i 've ever had . warming and luxurious , with the feel of articulation and dignity . carbonation is somewhere between medium and low and i feel that any lower and this thing would be a syrupy mess . being masterfully brewed however , this monstrous potion feels as good as a vegas hooker with a bottle of glenmorangie and a ... nevermind . clutch . d- could n't hold out on this one more than 6 months , with another in the basement for good measure . a real treat in my silver rimmed stone levitation tulip glass . 1/3 of the bottle has me 'stoned ' but the rest will be enjoyed on two more upcoming occasions . for the faint of heart and palate , this is as arrogant as any bastard could ever be ."

S"trying to lose weight and was curious to see how a 64 calorie beer would taste . 64 calories is the catch and 64 calories is what you get . a - color is a pale yellow that pours a 1 inch white head that does n't stay around long without any lace to speak of . s - smell is of corn and cereal but not skunky . t - better than some of the tradition swills but lacks any real flavor . taste is slightly sweet , carbonated and finishes with a tingle in the back of the throat . m - very light , watery at best . d - slammin - meaning you drink can these like water and with a low abv means a lot of them . but that just defeats the purpose of a low calorie beer . i would recommend drinking less of a better quality beer to achieve the same means ."

S"thanks to tyson for this one . pours thick and black with a dark brown head , like a mix between milk and dark chocolate , that swiftly vanishes , bubbling lightly as it goes . very thick , looks good . the smell eminating from the bottle upon opening promised me a truly `` aromatic '' experience ; and when poured , it does n't disappoint . hints of both chocolate and vanilla , with an undertone of bourbon/alcohol complimented by a trace of wood ( oak ? ) . the flavor borrows all those attributes of the smell , but descends upon the palate with an undesirable sweetness reminiscent of blueberries . that same sweetness gives way to a bitter burnt coffee aftertaste that , though not bad at all , could be more impressive . not as complex as it would have you hope from its smell , which could be attributed to the intensity of the sweetness up front and the burnt bitterness at the end . huge alcohol burn on the way down , and though it is n't all that unpleasant , it does n't add anything to the beer . let this beer age and cool down a bit . i might as well be eating this with a spoon ; the thickness is ridiculously awesome , and if it was n't for the fact that it is slightly over-carbonated , the mouthfeel would certainly warrant a 5. a slight burn going down warms up your whole body , which is n't so surprising considering the 12 %"

S"this beer is not retired . i went to the carrefour in varna , bulgaria today and found a great many of these on the shelf , when i did n't seen them about a month ago . the date on the bottle is 2/2/2010 so i think these are back into rotation . a : poured from the 500ml brown glass bottle into a weizen glass . the beer is a nice cloudy orange , just like a normal weiss , with a good amount of carbonation within . head was very surprising - 3 and a half fingers , pure white , and with very good retention - something i have n't really seen in a low abv beer before . nice . s : heavy on the bready/biscuity notes , with a slight hint of yeast , like a waft of biscuits n the oven . outside of that there is a slight hint of citrus and almost none of the stereotypical banana or bubblegum notes . in this way , this does n't quite smell like a weiss , but it 's not a bad smelling beer . t : here 's where the beer starts living up to the non-alcohol reputation . the beer has no backbone , and is very watery . there are some hints of bread or citrus , but almost invisible . this might as well be bud light , taste-wise . almost nothing here . finishes similar , a slight lick of some sort of light fruit , then just water all the way down . notes : for a moment there this seems like a `` real beer , '' right up to the moment before it hits your tongue . then everything fades back into reality . this might be a good beer substitute for someone on the wagon , but comes very short of being a good weiss . if i ever gave up alcohol , i do n't think i 'd go to na beers , but get into something else instead . they just do n't quite live up . that being said , i think this drink is probably near the top ( if not at the top ) of the na list . before drinking , it gives a good impression of being a real beer , which is really the point , is n't it ?"

S"taken from notes dated 9/13/2010 . a : although the label calls this a brown ale , it is actually fairly light . i 'd compare it to more of a medium-colored ipa with it 's light amber color . builds a thin 1-fingered head that disappears into pretty much nothing after a few minutes . no lacing to speak of . crystal clear . s : ah , this smells rich in spicy cloves , cinnamon and pumpkin . the spices overwhelm the pumpkin a bit but helps round out the nose . the bouquet on this is fantastic and sticks around potently throughout . actually getting more spices and alcohol in the nose than pumpkin . some pumpkin hints after the initial wave of spice , but it is obviously not a straight pumpkin-forward nose . t : the taste follows the nose on this one ! following the nose , the taste is very much so spice-dominated . i 'm getting some nutmeg and cinnamon , then a bit of alcohol , and then a hint of pumpkin . very warming and for those who are just getting into pumpkin brews , a nice way to ease into the pumpkin flavor . i 'd like for it to taste a bit fuller and less hot , but it is still quite tasty . a great combination of autumn flavors that has me looking forward to the change of seasons and halloween . m : mild carbonation , feels light in the mouth . alcohol warms the mouth . d : very high . the excellent mixture between spice and pumpkin helps this one go down easy and makes me almost reach for another bottle immediately . although i do wish the alcohol hid a bit more behind the richer flavors , for 7 % abv , i could sip this one all day ."

S"bottled on 3/3/09 , that 's a little late for this unpasteurized beer . guaranteed fresh for 180 days , this beer was bottled 204 days ago . appearance : deep brown with tinges of ruby near the edges . head grew to a finger height and settled into a slight covering of the body . smell : coffee and burnt chocolate . taste : dry up front ending with a tasty coffee turn at the end . burnt malt lingers on the tongue . mouthfeel : medium body , smooth . carbonation is good . the smoothness is what i like so much in oatmeal stouts , and this is a good example . drinkability : very high . this stout goes down easy and is very sessionable ."

S"this beer is like chocolate puddin ! i was lucky enough to discover a can of this in manuel antonio , costa rica . it pours just as you 'd expect , like a dark motor oil . a tan/yellow frothy head and a dark `` black hole '' color . it tastes like an incredibly rich version of the extra stout . it 's has exactly what the us domestic version is missing . this beer is luscious . it 's not what i 'd call `` drinkable '' though . you 'll catch a nice buzz off the first pint and you do n't exactly want to follow it with 5 more . regardless of the poor drinkability factor , have one sometime . if you 're into dark stouts , you 'll totally dig this one ."

S"got lucky enough to pick up a 4-pack at the local bevmo . looking for the 120min ipa too ... no luck yet . chilled bottle poured into a pint glass . a : deep reddish amber . small head with excellent retention and intricate lacing throughout the drink . s : fruity , piney hops . sweet malts and alcohol come through . t : piney and citrusy hops dominate , but are well balanced with spice , sweetness , and alcohol . none of the flavors dominate , making it a very well-rounded brew . m : full bodied , good carbonation . d : i 'm not a hophead and i do n't really seek out ipas . i would n't buy this again ( bottled ) due to the price , but if i saw it on tap i 'd make it a point to order it ."

S"bottled april 2011 . tasted 31 august 2011 , reviewed from notes . pours a dark brown , opaque , coffee-colored at the edges . big thick two-finger head , a light tan color , nice retention . tons of sticky lacing , so abundant it actually looks like lace . smell is interesting - dark malts , but also black licorice . about half black licorice , a quarter dark malts , and a quarter warm and slightly sweet ( vanilla ) . it 's a crazy cacophony that almost works , but does n't quite come together for me . the licorice is a little too dominant . sadly , i do n't like licorice . and this does n't taste like beer with licorice highlights , it tastes like licorice beer . there 's a little bit of dark roasted malts before the licorice kicks in , but the middle two-thirds of the taste is strong licorice and slightly bitter . i do n't like it . fortunately , it gets less licorice-heavy as it warms up , but still not enough that i really want to drink it . mouthfeel is quite thin and light . carbonation is medium-low - with the heaviness of the flavors , it could use some more . this beer does n't work for me . my big caveat , though , is that i do n't like licorice , and i do n't like the way it combines with beer . adding sharpness and bitterness on top of something that 's already bitter and sharp does n't help . adding black licorice to a rich , sweet stout might work , but here it just accentuates the qualities i do n't like : the acrid and thin bitter flavors ."

S"extremely fruity and hoppy , all in all far too busy , amazingly complex , but far too complex , also a mite sweet . the bitterness is nice and strong , stronger than the regular alt , but it ca n't quite balance out the sweet fruitiness . i wound up having to drink this one straight down more or less in order to make it palateable , which for the price is unfortunate to have to do . i 'd prefer to savor it . if you 're a big brandy fan mabye this one is for you , but i was rather disappointed .

S'12oz . bottle poured into a tulip-style glass . it pours a deep orange color with two fingers of head . lots of yeast floating around in the glass , a bad pour on my part . there is a bit of lace left on the glass . the smell is very fruity with white grapes and apples . there is also a good dose of alcohol to the smell . the taste is very malty and sugary , with some buttery diacetyl as well . the alcohol is very present in the taste too . the mouthfeel is fairly good , but the drinkability suffers due to some cloying and the large alcohol taste .'

S"appearance : very nice bottle but the beer itself does not impress with its looks . light amber / light copper color . thin , whitish head that dissipates very , very quickly . aroma : intense grassy , citrusy , floral flavors . i feel like i 'm rolling in a field full of tall grass and flowers . amazing ! incredibly refreshing , right from the start , before you even drink the first sip . taste : for someone with little experience in british ales , like me , it does have a ... british character , without being too ... `` weird '' . floral and slightly bitter character always there , with an underlying maltiness to keep things in balance . fairly strong alcoholic character , besides the mere 4.5 % abv . mouthfeel : light , `` thin '' , but just right for its character . little , but still detectable , carbonation . sense of dryness in the end . drinkability : yes . just yes ! can you smell that ( addictive ) smell ? refreshing , light , but nowhere close to `` watery '' . how did they do it ? it must be the fresh , organic ingredients , among other things . nicely paired with cheddar cheese and greek `` imi-hloro '' ( semi-fresh / green ) cheese ."

S"a - moderate pour into snifter produces finger-thick light tan head that produces medium head-retention and slowly fizzles out to thin film . swirling beer in glass rouses head , alcohol sticks slightly to side of glass , though lacing is not too prevalent . density of head is quite thick and when poured into a tulip glass , head retention is incredible and produces more lacing than in a snifter ! chill haze provides slightly opaque appearance . amber-brown to brown in appearance ( srm 19 ) with possibly a slight ruby hue to it . s - intense floral bouquet of hops & malts mix together beautifully ! biscuity note by way of the maris-otter pale malt mixes with syrupy sweet caramel . chocolate malts come through with a slightly roasted note , though mild at best . alcohol fusel tops out the mixture . slight orange aspect mixes with the chocolate , which makes me think of chocolate orange ice cream that i had once in paris ! no pine resin is noticeable , though with having used columbus , chinook and centennial hops , there 's no doubt that this beer should be yielding this under different circumstances . clearly , this beer is malt-forward , which is to style ! f/m - hops & malts constantly are vieing for position ! chocolate malt and hops leave a bitter kiss on the palate that lingers for some time . alcohol warms the throat and mouth and a syrupy sweet taste of caramel and raisins helps to balance out the hops . finish is wet , though does dry out with time , which shows that this beer was aged fairly extensively . a very slight tinge of roasty character does come through , which although is n't to style is welcomed . a piney note comes through when swirling the beer around on the palate , which is interesting , for i was n't able to pick this up in the aroma . the orange that i noticed in the aroma comes through slightly , though despite the 80 ibus , this beer maintains impressive notes of malt . with this said , hop-forward it is and the palate is quite taxed after several quaffs ! as the beer dries out , lemon drops come to mind and the tongue feels like a tired marathon runner that 's looking for more liquid to quench his/her thirst : ) carbonation is medium and provides a bit of tingling feeling and warmth from alcohol is moderate . wheat malt provides for a bit of grit and chewyness d/c - this beer at 10 % abv definitely packs a punch ! of all the barleywines i 've had though , this definitely ranks up there as one of the finer ! a truly incredible interpretation of new world meets old world and is something that i would continue to rely on at the ski lodge in scandinavia ."

S'blue body label double-deucer with a cool silver mountain in the background and a blurb about 75 ibus . dark zero light escaping pour like someone just filled my glass with midnight . this is buh-lack like used motor oil from a 1971 oldsmobile with a dense gargantuan tight light brown tan craggy surface-of-the-moon head cap which wont go away if ya asked it to . this is a monstrous cap of statuesque proportions leaving thick glass painting brown lace . huge massive grassy syrup pine forces muster and attack me nostrils . not too much more scents followed through with the oak barrel , but the roasted malts and piney hops commingle . first swigs : bakers chocolate , coffee , and pumpernickel . vanilla extract . quite complex . flavors meander with cocoa , brown sugar and roasted malts . lemon oil and pine tar blend with black coffee in the lingering aftertaste . beers dont get any thicker than this . a mega-heavy imperial stout . goes down like cake batter rather than beer . the drinkability was stifled as a result of the oak aged aspect getting in the way and the hops being so overwhelming to the point that the stout characteristics were subdued . plain yeti would be recommended . last swigs : grassy leafy hops meets thick roasted malt bakers chocolate . looks great , smells great , full bodied , but in the long run , just another r.i.s . wouldnt go for another if it were free . still hot with a lack of oak character overall . a lack of oak flavors which may need time to mellow and develop . maybe a year in the cellar will be stellar ? after a few swigs , this becomes such a flavoe monger that your tongue becomes entwined . reminiscent of vicry storm king such that if you have had storm king , ya aint missing much worthy to write home about . this ran the gamut of flavors since it started fridge fresh and wound up room temp tepid . beer is good . happy beering .'

S"12 oz bottle poured into a hefe glass . very nice bright white head , 2 fingers or more . receded to a medium lace , moderate stickiness . color is a standard golden-amber . smell seems off for a pale ale , almost lager-y . it 's little sour and yeasty . taste is a very , very mild hops , more sour than bitter . there is also a bready malt notes . mouthfeel is light in body , almost to the point of being watery . moderate carbonation . despite this not working very well as a pale ale , i can see this as a great hot weather beer . good for working in the yard . i may grab some after mowing ."

S"i got this as an extra from plucier a while back . one hell of an extra . this is the '07 . pours dark reddish mahogany . barely any foam . when swirled a small cap forms but does not stick around and it just reverts to a ring around the edges . looots of raspberry in the nose . that 's not really a suprise but it 's very strong . smells sweet and malty . it 's like syrup or sorbet . the syrup trend continues with the taste and mouthfeel . it 's like ice cream topping intermingled with other ingrediants like cocoa , caramel and cottoncandy . i 'm really enjoying just letting it roll around and picking up all the different things going on . it 's warm , smooth and dry . i was wondering why the bottle was so small ... not anymore though . i feel a little buzzed and i 'm not even halfway through . it 's an amazing sipper ."

S"12 oz . brown bottle poured into a dogfish head signature glass . served at cellar temperature , 45 degrees f. pours a beautiful deep copper-amber hue with a small half-finger of slightly off-white foam that does n't linger , fading to a thick crown that fails to stick very well , leaving behind only small , sporadic splotching on the walls of the glass . aroma is magnificent ; i 'd even venture as far as dream-like . bourbon notes take center stage here , and they are big and bold , with lots of vanilla and faint traces of alcohol . sitting right behind the bourbon notes are those of sweet maple . quite exquisite , making a sip difficult to resist . body is quite full but not heavy ; carbonation is mild , but there is just enough there to give a little pep to this heavy-hitter . up front sweet malt makes a brief appearance before the barrel aging really shines through again . vanilla notes are massive here , though not overpowering , and they stretch easily from start to finish . the maple on the palate is a bit more subdued than in the nose , but it stands present just after the malt begins to subside and just before the hops kick in , which combine with an immediate boozy warmth to balance out the sweet side and dry things a good bit . at the back the bourbon character really picks up , sliding down the back with a bourbon-vanilla-alcoholic fade ( which burns just a little on the throat ) in a finish that really shows off the aging character extremely well . at the finish , it 's almost easy to forget that this is a beer and not a snifter of kentucky whiskey . drinkability is severely hindered due to the strong alcoholic presence and content as well as the overall strength of character , and this is certainly something that i probably could only put back one of , two max . that said , this is certainly one of the most characterful and delightful beers i 've had the pleasure of trying to date . founders has done an amazing job here , and i must say that i 'd love to try the syrup that was aged in these barrels prior to their acquisition by the brewery . simply world class ."

S"poured from a bomber dated may 2010 into two pint glasses for my wife and me . tmk , this is the first bottling of this brew . dammit , biggred1 beat me to the first bottle review ! pours a rich amber , not quite dark enough to be copper . good inch of head on each glass . poured very clear into both glasses despite some sediment left in the bottle . the aroma is not very strong for a double ipa , but pleasant . tastes good . as indicated by the aroma , the hops are concentrated on the bittering , not the flavor or aroma . but nonetheless , this is a good , solid , if unexceptional , dipa . exactly what you 'd expect for the price ( $ 5.50 ) . mouthfeel is very good . all in all , a very drinkable beer . not an `` event '' dipa , but an exceptional choice for a more-than-one , especially for those of us in indiana who want to drink local ."

S'a - it pours a brilliant gold with nice white head , a decent level of retention and some lace . s - for a tripel , the aroma is quite euro-lager-y , and also of straw , banana and farm . and a rich yeast is obviously behind most of it . t - it tastes pretty delicious ; the yeast has a strong effect on the overall flavor of the brew . it goes from smooth to hot to a fully clean finish . makes for a dynamic experience , albeit solid and not spectacular . m - it totally enhances , or more so is an integral part of the flavor profile , as the mouthfeel interacts with and enables some of the flavors . d - pretty good , but it is hard to prefer it over other good belgian options .'

S"this beer pours a very dark brown ( not quite black ) color with copious amounts of creamy light-tan head that lingers around for a while and laces the glass pretty substantially . on the nose all i pick up on is something that reminds me of oats , not much roasty or chocolate or coffee , just toasted oats . almost reminds me of a bowl of cheerios . flavor wise there is a little more roastyness , but not much coffee or chocolate . it has a subtle sweetness to it that i do n't really enjoy with the oats . not exceptionally sweet or thick and creamy as the name would suggest . this beer is on the watery side for a stout , its very drinkable , but just not very creamy and viscous , really lacking in the flavor department too . i almost want to call this an oatmeal stout ."

S"`` julenatt '' means `` christmas night '' . so what do we have here ? a vanilla porter ? right . the colour is very deep brown-black , the liquid is clear and the pale brown foam forms a firm uneven finger thick head with minimal lacing . a large blob of yeast covers the bottom of the bottle . the smell is different . sweet notes of jellybeans , perfume , vanilla , oak wood , minerals and some roasted malt and a mild bitterness . the 3.0 does not mean average , more like i really dont know if it is good or bad . the taste is not as heavy as i had expected . an artificial candy-like flavour bubbles in the background white a fresh bitter roasted note develops into a milder , sweeter malt ( with some chocolate ) taste that changes into a very dry stout-like bitterness . the aftertaste got a slight metallic note , but it is mostly a dry , rather anonymous bittersweet quite long lasting flavour that finishes this beer . the carbonation is gentle with small bubbles . not much of vanilla then , more like a candy porter . and i am not really convinced ."

S"jesus , this is a big ale . another massive beer from dogfish head . ( as if anyone on this site has never heard of them ... ) appearance - a deep muddy coppered ale forms a smallish off white that , despite the abv , quite supprisingly lingers for a few moments before dissipating . lacing is minimal , but again more that i expected . smell - smells more like wine than an ale , with fresh grapes up front . a slight alchohol burn follows , and maybe , just maybe a touch of dry malts . hops are imperceptable to my nose . taste - a deep raisony explosion hits the mouth like a ton of bricks . `` fuck me , that 's complex . '' are the first words out of my mouth . alchohol burn is quite mild , only really warming up my chest . a little malty , and a bit of bitterness , which could be just percieved because of the large amount of other things going on . much like it 's little brother a slight metalic finish lingers . i 'm not sure how to rate this one . mouthfeel - a lively carbonation adds some lightness , but the ale its self is still dominatingly heavy . as top be expected . very smooth . drink one and take a nap . drinkability - 20 % will always destroy a beers drinkability , but that 's part of the fun , right ?"

S"my original review was deleted due to the system crashing . i do n't remember exactly what i said , but here are my general thoughts . i had the '08 a few months ago and was n't necessarily liking it a whole lot . thought it had a lot going for it but in the end was just too sweet . the '09 is a completely different beast though . big and very hoppy , with the sweetness merely adding complexity rather than dominating . my original rating was a 3.9 b+ , but i have updated it to reflect the '09"

S"appearance : the beer pours a dingy golden color and is topped off by a respectable white head . from a wheat beer i would expect a little more in terms of head volume but the consistency is creamy and displays good retention and lacing . smell : deliciously spot on ; huge notes of banana nut bread ooze from the glass . taste and mouthfeel : a bit of a let down from the scent , but the flavors still manage to come across slightly true bringing forth a creamy prominence of spiced banana up front despite panning out to a more dry and fruity ale like middle . the finish is more bready with good nutty banana undertones that carry on in to the aftertaste . overall the flavors are there but the development of said flavors paired with a marginally more sharp mouthfeel take away a bit from the beer . drinkability : i think this beer is perfectly delicious on any occasion and has all the makings of a repeat offender . bottom line : i think this is quite the slam dunk for hoppin ' frog . just enough attention to traditional qualities without too much sacrifice to their own interpretation of the style ."

S"bomber into a duvel tulip . much thanks to my buddy impma in phx az for hooking it up . gorgeous deep brown with a burgundy-mahogany hue beneath . that brett carbonation that has the tiny , off-white cosmic bubbles that gather round the edges of the glass and leave little round clusters sticking to the glass above the liquid level . aroma : 5 . complex and wonderful . dark cherries , cranberries , red wine , some wood , peaches and apples , brett damp earthiness . belgian farmhouse-y . some damp rose petals beneath . some sweetness that does not come through as much in the flavor . same flavours as above in the taste . dry finish with lasting flavours of tart cherries , cranberries , peaches , and especially plum . the most caramel-malt flavours i 've tasted in a sour . there is a sense of cloying that evolves in the taste and then that i feel in my stomach . oh well , the aroma and taste are fantastic - to the extent that i 've said wow a few times . the brett is actually relatively `` clean '' - perhaps because of the 30 ibu ? i might taste a touch of grassy hops at the end , followed by the honeyed figgy-plums . i also attribute the sense of a somewhat subdued brett funk to all the other things going on - cherries , wine barrels , and the thickness . feel is nice . thick and definitely has that brett-effect . i thought i 'd have no problem finishing this bomber solo , but it 's starting to get a little too sweet - i 'm sensitive to sweetness in beer - but there are still enough redeeming qualities to finish the bomber without too much discomfort . drinkablity has come done a bit and overall enjoyment has waned since sips 1-8 , but not because the alcohol has become noticeable ; it just seems heavier and not as refreshing now . oh well . next time i 'll prolly split it . i might prefer this to goudenband . i 'd love to do a side-by-side , but that has n't been in austin in about half a year , and it seems dissident has been gone for months . it tastes a little more belgian-y with the yeast/sediment poured it . also more muddled and thick . i 'm glad i waited until the end to dump it in . i started off loving it , buy still enjoyed finishing it . definitely recommended for it 's aroma alone , and it 's uniqueness , and is worth seeking out . tasted and contemplated with m83 's saturday=youth"

S'the beer poured into the chalice medium amber with a very slight haze . the head was just off-white and fell slowly to the edges of the surface then lasted to lace the glass . the aroma was low with caramel aromas and a light fruitiness . some slight floral aroma was also present . no appreciable increase in aroma occurred as the beer warmed in the chalice . the flavor was distinct deep caramel and dark fruits with a nice bittering component that keept the malt in check . some belgian spice was present in the flavor along with some light fruitiness . the flavors were all well blended and smooth , but the only real exhibit of pure complexity was how they hid the 9.2 % abv . the finish was even with lasting malt and caramel and belgian yeast spice into the aftertaste . the body was medium full and the carbonation made it seem less . 33 cl bottle . code on botttle 28 12 05 . the real winner to this beer is the ability to restrain the alcohol and still make a well balanced beer . the alcohol warming after consumption was still on the lower side and the beer was highly drinkable for the level of alcohol it contained .'

S"on-tap @ foothills the day of the olde rabbit 's foot release . a . same as total eclipse . dark black-brown , small bubbled red-brown head . decent retention . purty . s. big bourbon warmth , smooth oak and vanilla blended with some rich bourbon sweetness and the tasty roastedness of the stout . the barrel is in full force here and is foremost , but the beer is no slouch either . some chocolate and coffee peeks through . smells very `` complete '' , even if a bit aggressive . t. mm , bourbon . i love bourbon . i love pappy van winkle bourbon . i love pappy van winkle bourbon barrel aged beers . i love pappy van winkle bourbon barrel aged total eclipse stout . just stellar bourbon complexity that comes close to overwhelming the ( tasty ) stout underneath , but never quite manages to , thankfully . warm , peppery , vanilla , oak , toffee , cocoa , some ( cascade ? ) hops , mocha , roast . delicious . it works . m / d. full , thick , warming . wonderful bourbon-roasty finish . not overly drinkable , seems more a nightcap than a lunch beer ... i 'm pretty convinced that foothills has this bourbon barrel thing down . a great stout kicked up a few notches by a lovely bourbon . great if you like bourbon ."

S"i just returned from a week long kayaking trip in ecuador and drank more of this stuff than i would care to admit . for a macro produced lager ( did not seem like a pilsner at all ) it really is pretty good . there is nothing offensive about this beer , but on the other hand there is nothing that will blow you away either . that said , i think i would drink this over budweiser but since i could not do a side by side comparison i 'll never know for sure . i 'm not going to get in to commenting on tastes because you probably know what you are getting when it comes to a mass produced light beer . where pilsener gets you is the drinkability . this stuff goes down easier than water and when you are in ecuador , that is probably a good thing . just remember one thing when traveling south america : beer good , water bad ."

S"had at my sister 's wedding with a guy named andy . the following are taken from notes and the beer was drunk before i started pounding down glasses of sierra nevada pale ale . it appears dark brown with a sizable light brown head . it smells a bit of citrusy , grassy and pine like hops . there is a nice mild caramel sweetness as well . i also get a bit of a woody smell as well . the taste initially is dominated by a complex hop flavor . i get some mild citrus quality from the hops a nice grassy pine flavor from the hops and of course bitterness from the hops . the powerful hop flavor is dominated by a nice caramel flavor . there is a great strong oaky flavor that leaves a nice woody and vanilla like taste on the palate . really good they blended this beer perfectly and got the best elements of all three of the bastards . the carbonation is moderate . it has a nice mouth feel . the drinkability for the size of this beer is not bad , but this is not the kind of beer you drink all night . overall a fantastic beer . i feel lukcy for being able to pick up a bomber of this . stone did a fantastic job blending the three bastards ."

S"best by nov. 10 , 2013 . a - big sniftered . a decent frothy 1/2 finger off-white cap sits atop a hazy , opaque rusty-bronze body . little bubbles jet to the surface but carbonation does n't seem to be too prevalent or pronounced . s - bubblegum , fruity hops , unfermented sugars , slight booze notes , ever-so-slight dusty record store . this is bringing back memories of my golden days and i 'm loving it . great smelling brew . t - rather big on the tongue at first , it sorta overwhelmed me . guess it 's my first barleywine in a while haha . big big big booze notes that detract from the overall flavor . sweet malts couple with a big , dry hopping that do n't even try to balance each other out . just a bit unbalanced and not in the right places for me . the alcohol really gets to me , and gives me a slight cough medicine vibe . m - fucking sparkly . i do n't think any barleywine should be as crisp as this . the body is n't even bad , it 's the carbonation that 's just over the top . d - spritzy and boozy are the two words that sum up this one and done for me . notes : victory very rarely impresses me ."

S'i found my new cheapskate drinking buddy . pours with decent looking head that goes quick but leaves a bit of surface foam . smells of adjunct , maybe a hint of summer fruit such as plum . an alcohol laden bitter flavor , punctuated by a slight fruity dry taste that beckons one further into its inexpensive glory ... the can says union made and no additives or preservatives , so my heart is with miller , though their beer generally sucks . this is not fancy beer , but its dirt cheap like all american macros should be were it not for their inflated advertising budgets ( instead of using the money to make a better brew ) . i know some guys who make a bundle of money and still drink the beast . not that i am that dedicated . mouthfeel is unimpressive , drinkable yet intense , not very inviting , but what would one expect from a brew with 5.9 % alcohol for $ 5.37 a 12 pack ? drink the beast ice today , because tommorow we may go without ... as the ancient romans said ...'

S'beer in a limited edition 11.2oz bottle . very dark out of the bottle , little to no head . great smell , lots of interesting notes - tart vanillia , liquor scents . taste was bitter , with strong vanilla backing notes ; sour liquor-like notes are prominent . chocolate notes are secondary - definately for fans of sour , liquor-like beer-lovers . oddly enough , the cask conditioning appears to have brought out lots of sour and bitter notes in this beer . the regular engine oil is sweeter and more drinkable , and certainly more representative of the scotch ale style .'

S"picked up a few bottles at oak tree buy rite , edison nj , the store that sucks ... the money out of my wallet.. gladly : ) eyes ... gargoyle hoisting a brew ( i sense a theme from stone ... ) , deep amber with orange highlights , 1 full finger of pure white head with varying bubble size , from soapy crag on the top to tightly packed bubble wrap floating on top of the beer , lacing is mostly good , not great though ( retention is good ) , jeezus , i can smell it a foot away ... but i 'll get to that . a good looking dipa , nothing wowing me though to warrant more than a 4. nose ... grapefruits shoved up your nose , and then stomped down on by dyke boots until the citrus comes out yer ears , some `` green '' hops smell but mostly a huge citrus odor with pine accents , zero detection of the 10 % abv lurking in the depths waiting like the kraken ( hopefully medusa is not around , or her head ) . this is pretty one sided , not always a complaint with dipas but i have sniffed better , not too many better , but certainly some . taste etc ... this is pretty hot tasting ie alcohol , the hops do not fight off the alcohol enough imo , definitely needs mellowing out ( but i wonder if mellowing this out will also mellow the hops unfortunately ) . once you are used to the alcohol you can focus in on the other flavors a bit more . the hops are exactly as they smell , except the `` green '' taste is much more apparent , it is a nice green wood taste that lingers along with the citric bitter notes . i happen to like the bite the carbonation provides , very prickly and refreshing , a nice foil to the heavy handed hop oils that want to do a valdez on the wildlife of your mouth . this is definitely not one of the top dipas i have had . the flavor is a bit unbalanced but at the same time i can not call this `` a hop head 's delight '' .. something is missing . verdict ? a nice attempt but right now as is this beer has it 's flaws . just because it is stone does not make it the end all be all of beers . when stone hits it out of the park , they hit the cover off the ball , this is more like a ground rule double . i have plenty of bottles and will continue to taste it but right now i ca n't go ape about this one ."

S"a - pours like used motor oil . this stout is incredibly thick ... it even leaves solidifying residue on mouth of the glass as you drink it . light can not penetrate a glass of this at all . s - founders nailed it with this one . the bourbon aroma dominates , but coffee and cocoa take away the edge and leave a truly fantastic smell . t - wow . each sip is like a great journey . the first tongue contact reveals a sweet , mildly fruity character . then a wonderful bourbon flavor comes through ... balanced and woody , not overpowering . after the bourbon fades , a chocolate flavor is revealed , with the tail becoming darker and slightly bitter . this is definitely of the best stouts i 've ever had . m - wonderfully creamy and thick ... it coats your tongue and mouth without any `` grittiness '' . d - perhaps this is the weak point of this excellent beer . the taste is wonderful , complex and powerful , but it simply will not go away . the bourbon and chocolate resonate forever ... simply robbing you of an insatiable desire for the next sip ( but perhaps i 'm being a bit critical considering the 11.2 % abv ) . overall : this is a really , really nice imperial stout . it has an incredible taste ... but it 's a bit extreme and not an `` easy to drink '' . but considering the price , abv , and limited availability , you 're probably going to sip this slowly and infrequently ... and that 's how an intricate beer like this can be really enjoyed ."

S"this beer looks great . somewhere between golden and amber with a pillowy white head that lingers for the duration of your drink . the smell is good , but a little underwhelming . piney and citrusy hops dominate the slightest hint of malt sweetness . not too complex , but a nice fresh blast of ipa hoppiness . wow . a very solid beer . again , not much on complexity , but certainly refreshing . lots of piney and citrusy hops as the smell suggested and a nice grapefruit bitterness in the finish . the high abv is not noticeable until the aftertaste and the slight burn in the esophagus . a slight maltiness gives the beer a sweetness that actually compliments all the hops , but is in itself very subtle . it has a very odd herb/spice characteristic that i ca n't quite put my finger on . the beer is well carbonated with a medium bodied mouthfeel . i never get too excited about the mouthfeel of ipas or dipas , and this is about average . drinkability is through the roof . as previously stated , it 's hugely refreshing , and the abv does not hinder it 's ability to be consumed in mass amounts ."

S"had this a long time ago on tap at the z bar in state college . a : brownish red pour with a thick white head . very nice retention and lacing . s : slight bourbon smell but dominated by the spiciness of a winter warmer . t : it really only tastes like a winter warmer with hints of bourbon . spicy and caramel mainly . one of the more watered down bourbon aged beers i 've had . mf : decent amount of carbonation with hints of the alcohol . o : a miss . wanted more bourbon , less winter warmer . with that said , it 's a damn good winter warmer considering this is easily one of my least favorite styles ."

S"powerful floral and grapefruit scent and great head with full lace , that 's already two plusses , yep , this is an ipa . lighter orange with slight cloudiness . mouth is like fruit cocktail ? ? ? yep , the first impression i had was like the lite syrup from a cheap fruit cocktail . also the note of , furniture polish lemon ? ? that makes this a very different experience , confusing , but ... hell i do n't know . so , it 's all hops in this one , grapefruit , unbalanced , raw , like an imperial ipa , yet , there is that detracting finish on this . maybe they made this way to strong and got the balance off ? i love a good ipa but this was off for me . needless to say , i do n't think i 'll be having another ."

S"wow.. this one was a big miss for me . just way too much of an alcohol taste , so much that it ruins the whole beer . i could only stomach through half of this before i had to pour it out . it tasted like a poorly made mixed drink . the alcohol taste is n't bad in small quantities ( like any dipa/ris ) but this almost induced a gag reflex . it 's this breweries highest rated beer but i think it 's their worst.. take it as you will . just because it has a high abv does n't mean its good ..."

S"a- as much head as you could possibly want . if you hard pour it , it pours solid head . a soft pour leaves a couple of fingers that linger and lace beautifully ... it looks like whipped cream . s- yeast , raisins , strong malt , some slight anise , caramel , honey , alcohol , pepper ... one of the most complex noses i can remember . it 's wonderful . t- initial malts , some yeast , bread and biscuity notes , and strong warming alcohol . hops in the back come in to balance beautifully . a wonderful taste , but dissappointing after the outrageously good nose . m- thick and chewy , low carbonation , a lingering alcohol warmth and slight dryness after the smooth finish . d- the alcohol especially , and the bready flavor , make for slightly lower drinkability ... we split this bottle four ways , and we all had plenty ."

S"this was another take out from the headkeeper . i tried the southern tier pumking this past fall and fell in love with it , so i figured this imperial ipa . was worth a shot . i grabbed my crystal snifter and favorite bottle opener with gusto . the beer poured with a wonderful inch thick head . the color was a beautiful deep golden , with a minimal amount of lacing . the aroma of hops and citrus hit me immediately as i took the initial breath . the taste was bitter for an ipa . but also very mellow . this beer boasts an 11 % abv but you would n't know it by the taste ... it is very well hidden . this is a wonderful example of what an imperial ipa should be ."

S"oh ! a new beer at my favorite burger place who 's draught selection includes *three* varieties of macro light beers , sam adams , leinie 's honey weiss , and summit ( they do n't tell you it 's the extra pale unless you ask ) . they substituted the doppelbock for the usual leinie 's red . i 'll give it a go . appearance is opaque , burnt red color with a decent head that did n't last ( could be the glass - this is n't a beer-lover 's bar ) . aroma was mild , but the beer was served pretty cold . flavor ? umm , slightly hoppy and negligible malt flavor or sweetness . smell and flavor did not seem to improve upon warming . feels like water in the mouth . not a terrible beer , but a terrible doppelbock ."

'' in any case , i guess it is beer . does n't look , taste , smell , or act like a dopplebock , however . pours a strong gold with powerful carbonation going nuts throughout the glass . the beer really is a bit too sweet - it could use a stronger malt presence to balance it out . an interesting experience , but not one that i would want to have every day ."

S"again , another not so detailed review to get this one in the database . this is old ruffian brewed with a belgian yeast strain . you get all the beauty of the ruffian with a nice belgian funk . the tap hanlde just said `` belgian barley wine '' the yeast actually does a great job of balancing the super hoppiness of the old ruffian . it really brings out the maltiness of this beer and makes it a touch sweet . i really wanted a second pint of this beer , but i knew it might be a short night if i dove in . belgian yeast and barley wines are two of my favorites . get it while you can if they still have it ."

S'pours pitch black with a huge foamy/creamy bubbling tan head that fades slowly as all the bubbles pop and the head eases down ; looks like a stout with a foamy head . smells of cocoa , chocolate and roasted malt up front , followed by molasses or syrup , caramel , charcoal and light vanilla like a sweet rum ; some faint hops come through after the malts fade , but in general this smells like cocoa . tastes of cocoa , chocolate , roasted malt , coffee grinds , burnt grains or burnt wood , molasses or syrup , caramel , charcoal , light vanilla , faint citrus hops , lemon , mild citrus like grapefruit , brown sugar and a slight yeast funky-ness ( which was strange ) ; pretty much a malty beer that allows the cocoa and chocolate to control the flavor . while its sweet and enjoyable it just seems to be a bit limited in the overall sensation : the sweetness and hop flavors only seem to pop up and visit the tongue and not leave a lasting impression , so i wish they would have played a bigger part even though that deviates from the style . mouthfeel is slick and smooth with a watery feel , as this beer is very light , with a light body and the only aspect that seems heavy is the dry cocoa/coffee aftertaste ; very surprised at how light this beer felt and how easy it went down . decent drinkability , and another good sam adams variety pack beer , but not a beer that id buy a six pack ofworth trying for those who like variety .'

S"saw this at trader joe 's many a time for a mere $ 5.99 per 6-pack and finally decided to give it a try . definitely a good idea ... there is almost no yeast in the bottle at all , unlike most ipa 's . not bad , just different . by just looking at it in the bottle it looks extremely filtered . certainly the lightest , thinnest ipa i 've seen . once poured into a pint glass , mission st. india pale ale has a very nice and dense , pillowy white head which does subside almost completely but leaves nice lacing . the body is golden , amber in color and looks very crisp and light . it could pass for a lager or even a kolsch . it is totally clear ; there is absolutely no sediment that i can see . very attractive . the smell is of fresh sweet , grass , straw , and hops . very nice and pleasant . the taste is great . finally a drinkable ipa ! it is fairly thin and mild for an ipa , but still very smooth . it is very sweet but still has the requisite hoppy bitterness . there is a nice touch of grassy-ness also . this is definitely not an `` extreme '' beer , like everyone seems to want to make their ipa 's to be -- especially those cats up in the nw ! if that is what you 're after then this beer will disappoint you . however , it is a very drinkable and enjoyable ipa . it could pass for a straight pale ale by some people 's standards , but i think it is still hoppy enough to lay claim to `` ipa '' title . do n't sleep on this one ."

S"living in pa , getting beers this exclusive can come to be a real hassle . for us , certain distributors have the rights to certain breweries over a certain distribution area . i found out from my dogfish head distributor that they got 14 cases of this stuff for the 18 counties they cover , so of course i was excited when i tracked down and bought a bottle ! it was $ 25 but the chance to try it , good or bad , was worth it . i 'll go into more detail below , but in a phrase , this is one of the most unsublte beers i 've had recently ! a : pours like motor oil , thick as paint and jet black . and i mean jet black , i had about 3oz in a tiny wine glass and could just barely make out any hints of redness around the edges of the glass , even when i tilted and thinned it out , this stuff is a black hole . the head was also dark , a pale-ish tawny brown , short-lived but thick and smooth composed of small , uniform bubbles . s : as soon as i gave it a quick swirl and stuck my nose in the glass , one thought hit me ; `` wow ! this is something really special . '' malty and slightly toasty , with a strong hint of honey and a touch of coffee , and a bracing whiff of an exotic , spicy barkiness that i found rather enchanting . truly like nothing else t : again , like nothing else . the first flavors to hit are all the sweet honey flavor backed with a lot of smooth citrusy sweetness , followed by a typically stout-like maltiness and toasty flavor . the beginning and middle of this beer are really something , but the finish and lingering aftertaste are what brought my score down . definitely coffee , but with a kick of that bark-like pungency that made it taste almost like quinine . not a good compliment to the beer , and lasted way , way too long . m : as an avid stout/porter man , i liked this one . only lightly carbonated , but as thick and heavy as i have ever felt . sipping and swallowing feels like drinking liquid lead . also , dry . i like a dry beer , but going through the 3-5oz i drank took a full two 16oz glasses of water . d : to be shared among more than a few friends , the super strong flavors , pungent aftertaste , and heavy , dry qualities of the beer make for a brew where a dab 'll do ya . good for a small glass , particularly after dinner , but not something i 'd want to reach for on a daily basis . it 's worth the price"

S"after a nice dance with some other american-made belgian style beers ( new belgium , ommegang ) i figured to take most ba 's advice and check out allagash . i went for the dubbel , figuring it would be a nice mellow example of what the brewery can do . this beer pours a tannish-red color with a monster fluffy head that got quite out of control . there were nice swaths of lacing on the glass , and there was a nice belgian-sweetness on the nose . i was n't hugely into this dubbel . it had a chocolate-bar sweetness with hints of spice and cinnamon . the beer has a thin mouthfeel , which was the most dissapointing part . most belgians have rich and hedonistic mouthfeels , but this one just did n't cut it . more like a watery-stout feel on the palate . i was also annoyed by the fact that this beer seems much bigger than it really is , coming in at a relatively mild 7 % . i 'll keep trying this brewery 's offerings , but for now i think i 'll take a ommegang if i 'm drinking belgian on a budget ."

S"i got a sixer from the distributor near me just to broaden my ipa knowledge . i was a little disappointed since this ipa does n't really taste like an ipa ( and because i 'm a poor college student , the cost of $ 10.34 hurt ) . i can barely taste any hops yet it is a surprisingly dark red amber . it is a bit watery and thin for the style as well , but it is not without its character . practically no lacing , but at least some head remains on the top till the end . smell is so-so.. ( certainly not bad ) but it just smells malty . tastes somewhat undercarbonated but mouthfeel is still fair . probably the highest element of this beer is that it is very drinkable ; it is an overall pleasant beer that does n't fill you up as much even when compared to some other ipas . it was not what i expected but it is still worth a shot ."

S"poured from 12 oz bottle into nonic pint glass . a - pours a deep , rich brown , quite transparent . three finger head falls to 1/4 inch and then recedes to a persistent white cap . significant lacing . s - predominant aroma of nuts , roasted nuts , praline , and even butterscotch . some fruit lingers with dark malts . t - begins with upfront hazelnut flavor and perhaps brown sugar , but quickly gives way to red grapes , prunes , dates , and raisins . the bitterness kicks in and a woody , dry finish lingers for a couple of minutes . m - slick , with maybe a tad too much carbonation for my tastes . d - the bitterness is what would most deter me from knocking back three or four of these . snacks or a meal might be a good way to beat this , but in general i prefer less bitter beers for sessioning . otherwise it strikes a good balance between flavor and heaviness , and if not for the bitterness would make a great session beer . i 've had this beer before and did n't really enjoy it , though each time it grew on me and for the first time tonight i actually liked it in more ways than not . sammy smith has always made bitter beers , but the depth of flavor is worth the endurance . surely a beer i will revisit from time to time ."

S"poured into a samuel adams new glass appearance - 4.5 pours 1/2 white head . clear brown and amber color . reminds me of coke a little . smell - 3.5 i can smell some malt and a subtle hop scent . not much going on here , but what i do pickup makes it hard to not jump right into the tasting . taste - 4 first sip was very smooth . took 3 more quick sips . taste lingers nicely ... a little bitter . i can pick up the red style and it seems to have a nice subtle hop kick . i can taste something that may be alcohol burn but is not bad . it just reminds me of the usual imperial tongue teasing . mouthfeel - 4.5 smooth , smooth , smooth . low carbonation feel ; very smooth . mouthfeel is not overwhelming at all ... even with some swishing and aerating in the mouth . drinkability - 4 this is 7.2 % ? well , it actually seems low for an imperial style . but what do i know ? i could drink 2 or 3 of these without blinking . then i 'd need something with a little more flavor . comments - excellent to try and i 'd buy a single 12oz bottle or 2 again . but i 'd probably reach for some ballast point amber instead . ( yes , i know it is n't an imperial red ) i do n't have much experience with the imperial red style ( ie . none ) , but i 'd say this is tops in the category for me . excellent brew . i only wish i bought more than one 12oz bottle now . -- - 12oz bottle purchased at pizza port bottle shop in carlsbad , ca on friday , september 19 , 2008 . consumed on tuesday , september 23 , 2008 ."

S'12oz bottle a : pours pretty much black with a 3 finger head ( i had a mildly aggressive pour ) . nice head that sticks around and finishes to a creamy looking texture . beautiful lacing . s : dark , roasted smell mostly . hints of coffee in the background . t : the taste had an amazing espresso taste . very dark and roasted at the start with a nice bitter finish . hints of bitter chocolate also . this beer is a great find for me . i love espresso and coffee and this beer has it down to an art . it is like drinking a cold , carbonated espresso ! ! ! ! taste is a bit bitter on the finish , but matches the taste perfectly . will definitely be having this one again . great beer lost coast brewery ! ! ! !'

S"dark yellow color with immediate but non-lasting head ; trace bubbles coming up from the bottom of th glass very weak malt ; no hops no taste until the very end where there is a bit of sweetness from the malt ; almost like an afterthought . mouth feel is absolutely average for the style . for a 'full flavored ' beer very drinkable.i rated drinkability as very high because it 's accessible to the consumer , it 's inoffensive to most every tongue , and people , [ myself included way back at the start of college ] drink it in more than medically sound amounts ."

S'i had a pitcher of snake dog ipa at a tavern . it was on special for $ 5.00 . pours a copper/gold color and is hazy . a rich foamy white head forms on every glass . the head dissipates slowly and laces the glass nicely . the smell is typical of an ipa . citrus notes and a real hop presence which yields a pine aroma . the taste is also typical of the style , with tangy citrus flavors , and an extra bitter aftertaste . the mouth feel is crisp and refreshing . the beer is moderately carbonated . this is a drinkable beer , and a very typical example of the style . id have it again , especially at $ 5 for a pitcher .'

S"have seen these around forever , but never picked any up until it arrived in my beer of the month club . i 'm happier that way , frankly . this looks promising coming out the bottle . a hazy , deep straw-orange , almost like an ipa . nice retention if moderately poor lacing . on the nose , though , this is offensively over-spiced . pepper and coriander so strong it 's like sticking your nose in a spice bin . fortunately on the palate this is somewhat muted . this is surprisingly full bodied ( medium to medium full ) and is nicely rounded with a crisp , sparkling finish . mid-palate has a grainy , lightly toasted or bready sweetness . this is almost powdery , however , in the spice notes , and although it is n't terribly sweet to taste , the body sits a bit sweet on the tongue , leaving this feel sticky and spicy and not terribly refreshing for a lager or a wit . i bet you could find a food pairing that would take advantage of this faux-wit 's strength : its abundant body and structure , and turn its primary negative : the excess of spice , and make it a better experience . unlike saison du buff , which somehow manages to make an herb-forward beer that pleases , the spices here ( and perhaps that 's the key ) foil this beer ."

S"deep yellow with orange/amber hints . low head that 's just gone . smells sweet corn and malt . ? i 'm maybe imagining things . ok , how about light wheat malt . at least it does n't taste like the macro lager i thought i smelled . oof ! in fact , it 's kind of similar to a wheat beer in the aftertaste . but there 's everything that comes before that and everything that comes before that , well , is n't really there . crisp , dry , bitter . hints of banana but only in the aftertaste . probably a great beer for the dog days of summer - i can totally see how it would be refreshing on a wicked hot day . not something that i would recognize as a wheat beer . drinkability is high in the context of hot-day summer beer drinking . i 'd way rather have one of these than a macro lager ."

S"overall , this beer is far from good . the color is too light , the taste and smell leave something to be desired and coors light typically tastes watered down . the one redeeming quality of coors light is it is quite drinkable in a mass amount sense . what i mean by that is that because of it 's light texture and flavor , `` the silver bullet '' can be used for parties and get togethers , when one does not want to spend too much money . it 's worth trying if its free , but if you 're going to buy beer , spend the extra dollar and get a better beer ."

S"one of the first lcbo fall release brews to make it out my way . i 've been very pleased with almost everything st has released so far , so i 've certainly been looking forward to this ! poured into a duvel chalice . inky black , with a thin tan head that dissolves into a fine ring . some lacing when i swirl the brew around . nose is rich , milky chocolate , very delectable . indeed , as other posters have mentioned , chocolate syrup is n't too far off the mark here . hard to detect anything else , but frankly , i do n't care . the chocolate smells that good . despite such a sweet-smelling nose ( and keeping in mind the super-sweet concoction of their creme brulee stout ) , i was surprised as to how sharp the chocolate was in this brew . not bitter , mind you , but certainly not milk chocolate . much more in tune with the mexican chocolate featured on the label . big flavor burst here of both the chocolate and some coffee/roasted malts , with delightful warming alcohol to the finish . my mouth is well-coated in bitter chocolatey goodness which lingers for quite some time . a great evening brew for the first frost of the season ( in ontario , anyhow ) . rich and hearty , choklat has a thick , velvety mouthfeel , with light but detectable carbonation . well worth the pickup ( and the price - nearly $ 10 in ontario ) . a great stout , neither too bitter nor cloyingly sweet . certainly a well-made brew , although not one i 'd return to regularly . despite the delicious flavor , i 'm having a bit of trouble finishing choklat because it is so incredibly rich . i 'd advise that folks share a bottle after dinner with friends , because one bottle is pretty heavy for one person . great work by southern tier ."

S"12 oz can poured into a snifter fridge temp 2008 appearance : pours a cloudy golden color with a short lived 1/2 '' off-white head . carbonation seems pretty lively , as bubbles cling to the side of the glass . swirling creates a tiny bit of lace . smell : a strong , distinct wheat aroma comes out of the glass . a small watermelon aroma is present . taste : a unique blend of jolly rancher-esque watermelon flavor blends with a normal wheat flavored beer . the wheat malt makes a nest for the watermelon flavor to be all over the place . not as bad as i thought it would be . mouthfeel : a very nice , medium , smooth body is created by the use of wheat , but is corrupted by the cloying sweetness of the watermelon aftertaste . did i just rot my teeth with a jolly rancher ? drinknability : not a great beer , but a great niche beer . i would buy a case of it under 3 conditions : it was cheap , local , and during the summertime . overall , decent ."

S"as my first beer review ever i decided to pick a style that i 'm very familiar with and try a beefed-up version of it . i started carrying avery 's dictator line because of a combination of the brewery 's exceptional reputation and the outright marketability of this cool concept . plus , the gigantic abv percentages are a nice bonus . out of a 22oz . bottle into an imperial pint , it pours a hazy copper with a two finger creamy head that dissipates fairly quickly . pretty much exactly what i was expecting - no surprises here . big big smells . my nose stays focused on a piney , dank smell surrounded by some fruit smells i ca n't identify . outright . lots of people mention pineapple - i do n't get that . some also mention passion fruit but we do n't get a lot of passion fruit at the grocery stores here in minnesota so , who knows ? maybe it 's there . taste is hops hops hops all day . pine again , with a really smooth bitterness . mouthfeel is smooth as well - there 's lots for your tongue to do while your brain figures out what 's going on . as soon as a flavor freaks you out a little bit it 's replaced with something just a little different to keep you on your toes . overall , this is a serious ipa with a big reputation to uphold . i 'm not sure what i was expecting , but this was a good drinking session with lots to occupy and educate . this is a great beer , but for me not very sessionable , probably thanks to the 10.54 % abv . still , highly recommended for fans of the style that want to move above and beyond the basics ."

S"been so long since i 've opened one of these . 4pm on a tuesday afternoon ? why not ? 2008 bottle poured into a bruery tulip . the pour is a deep , dark brown - not quite black , but pretty close . a small tan head forms , recedes to a collar almost instantly . this beer pours as thick as any beer i can think of . the pour is almost whisper quiet , indicating ridiculous viscosity . like a glass of used motor oil . smell is fantastic . leather , tobacco , and an oak and smoke background . a little boozy , but not to the degree that the abv would indicate . bourbon , oak , vanilla . very complex , very inviting . the taste is divine . the tobacco leads , with leather not far behind . the bourbon is noticeable , but contributes more in flavor than it does in booziness . this beer has done well over the last couple years of aging ... i 'm glad i have more . espresso , molasses and brown sugar round the taste out . this is slightly sweet , but not nearly as much as other imperial stouts . mouthfeel is great . thick , oily , sticky . this beer , despite being massive in flavor and in alcohol content , is still very drinkable ( all things considered ) . it 's a sipping beer to be sure , but damn , i would n't mind having a couple of these in a night . excellent beer . highly , highly recommended . ***edit : as the beer warmed further towards room temperature , some booze and a bit of unwanted astringency manifested itself . taking off 0.5 for both mouthfeel and drinkability . still highly recommended . ***"

S"i picked up a 30 pack since they were on sale . i like to have an economical `` daily driver '' light beer on hand through my work week and enjoy my favorite full bodied craft brews on weekends . the keystone light was a disappoint although it did n't seem greatly different from other industrial made light beers i have consumed over the years . i poured a can of the slightly yellow tinted fluid into my favorite beer glass and noticed a very vigorous head . sadly it rapidly decomposed into a small ring clinging to the side of my heavy tumbler . the aroma as it fizzed away was nothing good or bad , just nothing . this was no doubt a good preview of what it would taste like . the mouth feel was good , aided by the still abundance of carbonation . there is a small hops presence but not quite enough to prevent some sweets getting through on finish . well that 's about all there is to it , just fizzy water with a little beer flavoring . lacking flavor it 's still a drinkable beer good for chugging or for parties with the in-laws . i wo n't kick the remaining 'stones out of my fridge but will stick with my regular daily driver ."

S'the beer poured into the tulip crystal clear reddish amber with a tall frothy amber hued head that lasted well and fell slowly to coat at the glass . the aroma was raspberries . plungins you nose in the sniffer was like smashing up fresh sweet aromatic raspberries . the flavor was light with bittering that accentuated the raspberry presence . the raspberry flavor was well done and not overly sweet . the beer certainly dried on the palate over time . the finish was dry with lasting raspberry flavor that becomes more dry and interestingly bitter the longer it contacts the palate . the body was medium light to almost light . the beer goes down like water , but could use more complexity all the way around . 75 cl bailed and corked bottle , best before end 2005 on label . bottle says 6 % abv . i thought this was going to be a lambic prior to opening ... oh well .'

S"pours a cola-brown with a 1/2 inch cap and remains nice and foamy throughout . good head retention . the smell is the thing on this beer . it has a burnt wood type of smell with burnt roasted malt coming through too . i do n't think it is burnt but just extra dark roasted . this only applies to the cask version -- i tried the colder co2 version and it lacks this characteristic completely . that 's why i am reviewing the cask and that 's why i am giving it high scores . it is very unusual in both smell and taste . taste is almost the same as the smell except it seems like cedar -this woody taste . it also reminds me a little of burning leaves -- very autumnal . sticky finish but nothing too sweet or syrupy . mouthfeel is fuzzy , woody , and sticky . drinkability is average cuz this thing is way out there in terms of taste - i 'm almost scared to have more than 2 for fear that i might taste the burnt wood in my mouth for the rest of the day/night after . this is not a typical stout . while i gave it slightly lower scores on my notes from a couple days ago , it reminds me of a good movie , where it takes you a while after watching the movie to realize it was good . and i am looking forward to returning for another try much sooner than i originally would have thought ."

S"purchased this beer on a whim at beer mart in reading , pa after enjoying the company 's oktoberfest last year . i purchased a case on clearance for $ 9.99 ! ( oktoberfest was $ 10.99 last year ) i poured the beer into a pint glass for enjoyment . color was a sort of light and cloudy , almost like a belgian tripel . smell : initially , i took a good sniff which revealed hints of banana and some citrus along with a wheaty finish . first sip : i was very pleased ! while of the belgian style , this beer was certainly american ; however , you can taste the belgian influence . the beer has a smooth and subtle yet intriguing citrus flavor that is not overwhelming but just right . the beer finished quite clean with no odd aftertaste . drinkability : this beer was not very heavy and flavor was good not overwhelming . i enjoyed two no problem ... recommendation : i would certainly try this beer . for the money , its a darn good deal . i do n't particular enjoy beers of this style during the cold fall and winter here in pennsylvania , but this one is refreshing nonetheless and can see that it would make an excellent beer to drink on a hot summers eve while sitting with man 's best friend on your front porch !"

S"served chilled in a tumbler . a ( very ) slow pour produced plenty of rocky dark-tan head from the can , with excellent lacing . pours dark and opaque , black to the eye , and exhibits crimson and deep burnt sienna characteristics when held up to direct sunlight . nose is heavy on the dark roasted malts , with a pleasant smokey character , espresso notes , and slightly oily and tangy as well . sweet and tangy on first sip , as well as chalky and unctious . . . is this their cream stout ? some light espresso and heavier cocoa/chocolate notes , a touch ( *very light* ) of green apple and iodine and more of that smoke from the nose . . . if this is a bock it 's quite a ways off-stye ( unless maybe it 's a smoked bock ) , and seeing mabz 's description of the aaaah bock i know the old stone city bock was fairly earthy , but this drinks far more to style as a cream stout . lingering chalky character and medium bitterness , fairly dry and bitter in the finish . . . it fits the style . body is medium-full , with fairly minimal carbonation ( once it 's out of the can ) and a creamy mouthfeel . very , very drinkable for the style , and there 's none of that intense sweetness i 've had from many milk stouts . way to fool a guy with the self-adhhesive labels ! i hope the stout can has some bock in it ; on second thought naw , i enjoyed this brew more than i do most bocks . . . a cream stout this well rendered is few and far between , and it 's in a can , too ! worth seeking out ."

S"appearance : pours to a murky caramel-brown at first , then clears up to an amber-yellow . the head , however is simply fantastic . the widget creates a huge , thick and creamy light tan head that settles and retains a 2 finger froth that simply does not go away . aroma : smells of grain and faint , very faint citrus hops . nothing really predominant . taste : honestly , i thought i was drinking water for a minute . literally no flavor up front , however it finishes with some minor hops and a barely noticeable caramel malt . mouthfeel : medium bodied and very creamy . very little carbonation . drinkability : looks great , feels great , just wished it tasted great . does n't taste bad , it just lacks any real flavor at all ."

S'22oz . bottle poured into a snifter . 11/05/10 bottled date . huge thanks to beerfmandy for opening this with us ! ( a ) - pours very thick and pitch black . produced a minimal tan head that dissipated after awhile . ( s ) - ridiculously rich ; plenty of boozy molasses and raisin . some creamy vanilla and bourbon notes . minimal cocoa . ( t ) - again , very rich with a blast of vanilla up front . bits of chocolate and molasses behind it with an ever present boozy heat . ( m ) - a good carbonation level . extremely rich and boozy . the vanilla is nice , but in my opinion , tends to overwhelm some of the other flavors completely . ( d ) - on par with the regular version , but it seems even more boozy than that . the vanilla definitely adds additional richness and sweetness to this . it needs time in my opinion , though , what that will do the the vanilla character , only time will tell . in all seriousness though , i really do not see what all the fuss is about . i will stick to the regular .'

S"the original oeo is chocolate malt-laden decadence . the special reserve is pomp and circumstance . the brew is tainted , not infused , with off-flavors of whiskey that lend an odd green raisin , olive , and old sock nose . there are some tart vinous qualities on the tongue muted by an overbearing cocoa sweetness . there 's an element of pinot noir presented by light notes of ( mostly dark ) cherry , plum , and loud , loud prune that later comes to dominate the brew . more aggressive and this might be along the lines of a shiraz . but i do not mean to suggest that these flavors characterize the beer ; they are secondary and even tertiary components . the longer oeo sr settles , the more the prunes dominate . if you think hard enough , you might get some dried dates as well . it is n't evocative and , after a while , it is n't even pleasant . i 've had scotch aged in sherry and port casks and the good ones always showed their experience ( the wood ) first , and then showed what they 'd learned , how they 'd come into their own . while some sour notes in oeo special reserve kind of make me think of whiskey , i hardly find it worth the effort . and if these prune notes come out of the aging , then they should have scratched the plans long ago . the finish is a bit charred , chocolatey , and absolutely delicious when it garners up the strength to punch through the dark stone fruit . unfortunately , this wholly unbalanced beer gives us no time to enjoy the good stuff . relax , relax . ng"

S'a - this beer pours a hazy golden yellow with a finger of rocky head the fades to a lace rather quickly , sustained carbonation with a few streams so thin that i thought a hair was in my glass s - almost a bmc maltiness , wheres the wheat ? wheres the honey ? hmm , thats really all there is to the aroma t - there it is , a decent wheatiness and a subtle honey sweetness , still is that lingering bmc maltiness , and odd balance of nice craft flavor and some bmc maltiness , but still a decent flavor , with a lower abv would make a decent session beer m & d - not ultrasmooth , but nice and easy , somewhat fizzy , not to a soda level but a liveliness on the tongue , overall to sweet from the over-maltedness of it , but has potential , a decent brew'

S'nice shaped bottle with a bb 25 01 09 date on it , had it in my dbf for about 4 months . poured a thin dark shoeleather brown color with a pillow-y yet rocky off-white head that remained a large fat ring and skim coat on top for the entire glass , moderate lacing . smell is like a cup of coffee with sugar , no cream . literally . taste is like a cup of coffee . it doesnt have the common flavor like you are sucking on roasted , ground coffee beans.. this is more like a cup of fresh brewed coffee . it sorta tastes like i had a half a glass of leftover beer and poured my morning coffee into the cup and drank it . it is actually quite good . there is only slight bitterness on the finish with a slightly dry , chalky finish which helps to dry the palate and screams to be drank again . mouthfeel is pretty thin , i have probably had regular coffee thicker than this before , and there is a fair amount of carbonation as well , but these only serve to make it lighter and easier to drink quickly . as for drinkability , i am happy to report it is only 6 % because i could easily suck down several of these in no time flat without question ... a very easily consumed beverage . i will definitely try to keep one or two of these in the dbf for those times where a cup of coffee just wont do and i need the added bonus of alcohol ; )'

S'this poured a bit darker than i was expecting with a very nice looking heat that lasted all of 45 seconds . colour is dark reddish brown . smell is very malty and a bit earthy . almost smells like a glass of unsweet tea with perhaps some ground oats in it . taste , too is very , very malty with loads of toasted cereal profiles . this seems bereft of any hops at all , in fact . it is also quite sweet , which is why i placed drinkability at 3.0 . this is a good brown ale that i like very much , and could perhaps be sessionable if by sessionable you mean around three . the sweetness on the finish in this one would most likely prevent me from having more than four of these at the most in a sitting . i did really enjoy it , though .'

S"on nitro- tap @ iron hill lancaster on 1/29/11 . served in a 10 oz footed pils glass . this pours fairly black , with some ruby coming out along the bottom of the glass , and is topped with a thick finger of mocha colored head . just a great nitro-induced look to this , with heavy swathes of lace sticking to the sides of the glass like crazy . the aroma smells of fresh coffee grounds that mingle with some floral and leafy hop notes before a delicious tangy mix of vanilla and chocolate greets the nose . there is a touch of alcohol in the back but it merely adds a bit of extra warm sweetness to the proceedings . the taste is sweet and creamy with chocolate and vanilla upon first sip , which then quickly moves into fresh roasted coffee character and some citric hop bitterness that starts to stretch into the backend of the profile before meeting an extra wave of chocolate and caramel flavors . this finishes with a mix of dry roast and some lingering leftover earthy hops . the mouthfeel is full bodied yet still creamy and smooth in the mouth despite the high abv . i mean the alcohol is just magnificantly well hidden here . i could have sworn that this was 6 % if it was n't for the overall heavier feel of the flavors . while this did n't quite come off to me like the most full flavored or complex stout out there , it 's the nitro pour here that elevates this and really puts it over the edge . i mean it 's so smooth and creamy ; it literally went down like a fuller bodied guinness at times . just unbelievable drinkibility for a stout this big and its probably one of the most dangerously quaffable beers that i 've had in some time . i initially went with the 10 oz pour because of the high abv but could have easily gone the full 20 oz mug without straining my palate in the least . fantastic stuff !"

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint . this was the beer that brought me into the world of better beer so i guess it 's time that i got around to reviewing it . appearance is an orange gold . pour produces a fizzy white head that recedes after a bit and does n't leave a whole lot of lacing . scent is faint but mostly fruity with some grainy undertones . taste is grainy with some faint hop and tea leaf tones up front with a crisp fruity apricot finish . one of the things i like about this beer is the fact that it 's kind of a fruit beer without really tasting like a fruit beer . mouthfeel is medium/light bodied and the drinkability is phenomenal . i know this is a pretty average beer but it will remain one of my all time favorites for the simple fact that i owe my current craft beer passion to this beer ."

S"presentation : poured from a 22 oz brown bomber into a large chalice . label is typical of 3f , a demonically grinning sun , surrounded by various cartoon space creatures , characters , etc . `` it 's not normal '' on the side . no freshness date . i can see an inch or two of sludge on the bottom , that 's not normal . appearance : pours with just over 1 finger of very dark tan head . this settles quickly to an incomplete layer of foam with a large island above the nucleation point . some lacing . the beer itself is an extremely dark brown with no hints of light passing through , even around the edges . bottle has a ton of sludge . smell : strong roasted barley aromas with undertones of black coffee and bitter cocoa . hints of cherries and dark fruits . green , vegetal hops in the finish . taste : green vegetal notes upfront followed by cocoa/chocolate flavors . lingering roasted barley bitterness , but generally more mild than i would have expected based upon aroma . mouthfeel : average to higher than average carbonation level . body is very good . drinkability : one note , why ca n't 3f seem to get a grip on quality control . most of their beers are phenomenal , but most also have serious qc issues . case in point , the unbelievable sludge layer in this one means i probably got 15 or so ounces out of the 22 oz bomber . i really think i would rather drink decent beer with consistent quality , then great beer with the hit or miss problems . 3f , you are great brewers , but you are also businessmen , whether you want to admit it or not . get your shit together please ."

S'appearance : this beer is a pleasing golden , dark-orange color , with a foamy head that fades quickly and clings slightly to the glass . smell : spicy and fruity , but not overwhelmingly so . taste : smooth at first , then the spice flavor kicks in . the hops are tastable underneath , but theyre not as prevalent as other , stronger ipas . mouthfeel : again , very smooth . not too carbonated or dry . a bit waterier than i expected , but not that noticeable . drinkability : its easy to have more than one of these . great for enjoying a drinkable , refreshing beer with more taste and flavor than usual , but if you want something really complex or bold , look elsewhere .'

S"appearance was dark brown with tinges of honey at the edges with a thin white head that dissipated rather quickly . did n't look like much at first look . smell was somewhat like a light aroma emanating from a bottle of maple syrup and a bit of nuttiness . apart from making me crave pancakes - it was very nice . taste is of a light maple sweetness mixed with a bit of roasted nuttiness . can definitely taste some toasted malt . the more i drank it , the more the maple syrupiness moved to the background and the light nuttiness came out . it was a very nice blend of flavors although it was all on the light end . not really a robust flavor profile but that 's a good thing sometimes . i was hoping for something big here , judging by the label . mouthfeel is smooth . nothing else jumps out to mind either good or bad . so it gets an average score . drinkability was excellent . i kept thinking to myself , `` this beer is n't even that good '' . and in a few minutes , i had polished off the bottle without knowing it . that light flavor contributes to the huge drinkability . i 'll definitely pick up some more bottles of this when i 'm in the mood for something maple-flavored ."

S'i am sampling at room temp in an english pint glass . the beer pours a rich dark color and allows no light to pass through . a large creamy tan head foams up 3 cm easily and recedes slowly leaving large craters on the surface . aroma is mostly roasted malt with some lite espresso bean notes mixing in . not very robust on the nose , but not unappealing either . first sip reveals a thin watery body with mild carbonation . flavor is all malt with some short appearance of a sweet malty flavor that is quickly overtaken by roasted malt and finishes dry and coffee-esque . not a very lingering flavor on the finish . the beer is lite and very drinkable . at 4.0 % abv it would be an incredible session beer i think .'

S'dusky , dark bronze with reddish highlights are a jeweled firmament to a blossoming , creamy , off-white , 3-finger head . head developes pits , then crumples and recedes to a gossamer ring supported by a constant stream of fine bubbles from the glasss etching . notes of green , leafy hops are sharp at first , but tempered by a light molasses and toffee sweetness . noticeable mineral-bite when cold but softens nicely and disappears as it warms . an earthy , almost peat-like fragrance is in the back . taste starts with malts that are of toffee and oven-roasted pecans and walnuts . a touch of smoky , roasted grain and faint hints of maraschino cherries and dried fruit . somewhat to my surprise , slices of honeycrisp apple paired very well and brought out an apple-skin bitternes , which was quite enjoyable . bracing , fresh hops give a tingly , mineral-citric edge which combined with the robust malts bring together a sturdy , rich christmas-y flavour . medium , body supported by smooth , active conditioning compliment the strong flavor and while alcohol is well hidden , two of these is all i can muster appropriate for an evening sipper on a cold night . another solid standard from a great brewery and one i look forward to every year . pecan pie , bread pudding or dare i say , a fruitcake would do quite well with this brew .'

S"i was a little bit disappointed with this helles from pete 's . while it is n't heavily flawed , it just seems to be sitting on the fence of mediocrity in all facets . still a notch ahead of most mainstream macros , this is a good choice if all that is available is the same old stuff . pete 's wicked helles pours a very nice golden color , but the thin , fizzy/foamy head that forms disappears in under 30 seconds into nothingness . the smell has some light malt and some mild hoppy aromas , but i thought i detected some corn , which would explain the `` cheap smell '' in the aroma . mouthfeel is thin and a bit over-carbonated . the flavor is rather unspectacular as well . there is an almost decent malt presence here , lending some cracker-like notes to the beer , but what i perceive to be corn arrives here as well . there is an herbal/lightly fruity hoppiness present , and the finish is moderately drying . aftertaste has some neutral grain flavors , and yes , light corn . this one finishes off with a very light alcoholic warmth . i certainly expected more out of this , but it ended up tasting like a middle-of-the-line macro lager to me ( see michelob ) . a decent , drinkable beer , but probably not worth the admission pete is charging ."

S"pours a hazy , pale , yellow ochre . non-filtered , so particulate matter is evident and the beer is translucent . moderate carbonation is visible . the beer forms a thin ( 1 finger ) head that dissapates quickly . smells of wheat , rye , slight herbal hints , some almond and very slight citrus aroma as well . tastes initially somewhat dull , but it improves a bit over the back of the tongue . very earthy , nut-like feel in the back of the mouth , slight citrus , a bit of grass , and finally a weak hops kick as you swallow . leaves an aftertaste of cooked rice or grits . the carbonation is just about right . the beer comes on a little thick at first , but finishes nicely . a little bit cloying for my taste , but not bad for the style . overall this beer is pretty drinkable . it does n't seem to sour your mouth very much over time , and it drinks quite smoothly . not my style of choice , but it 's pretty well done none-the-less . i might buy it again sometime for sipping on those hot summer days ."

S"poured a cola color . far too light for a stout . little head . nose was somwhat sickly sweet , not what i want from a stout . taste is sweet with very muted tones of chocolate and brown sugar . mouth was surprisingly thin . nope no way i 'd session this at $ 8 a bottle and a high abv . i can only hope it improves with age ."

S"a- clear golden orange , nearly the color of slightly aged orange peel with a light frothy off white head that shrinks incredibly quickly ... bubbles wiggle up to the top but the foam continues to diminish and on a polished glass there 's no stickies to be found . s- at first what smells like it could be citric hop aroma turns out to be a strange mixture of co2 and orange soda . orange blossom honey is definitely present but seems to get mixed up with and ultimately overpowering some pale malt . the floral notes of ripe orange peel also play a small part and after taking some time and putting things in perspective , the 'orange soda ' smell is actually a decent blend of all things orange ( minus the juice ) . though not much beer smell can be appreciated , the floral lean of this one is nice . t- thankfully , more malt is present in the taste . a good amount , as it were . blossom honey is up front holding hands with caramel malt and a slight bitterness of orange pith . the actual orange flavor is very subtle , only being revealed in the finish and in some vapors as i exhale through my nose . there 's also a very small amount of earthy bitterness near the end , taking on a chocolatey flavor from being combined with the honey . mf- one thing is for sure- this cream ale is creamy . unfortunately , the nice full feeling is compromised by a cloying sugary film that forms on the inside of my cheeks and a high level of carbonation . d- fruit beers are n't my favorite style , but orange blossom is my favorite variety of honey so i had to give this a try . i 've had some terrible fruit beers and i 've had some ok fruit beers , but my mind 's eye still imagines something quintessential that i have yet to taste . that being said , bill 's orange blossom cream ale is a pretty decent brew , mostly because they 've highlighted the floral essence of the orange rather than the plain fruitiness of the juice . still- sweet , sugary , gave me a headache ."

S"pours a very nice deep orange-hued amber color with a slight reddish head that does not last long . thick and viscous looking . smells wonderful : spruce needles , orange zest , middle-eastern spices , and alcohol . true to the american style , this barley wine is quite hoppy . tastes very much like dogfish head 's double ipa . nice resiny hop flavor that is not too over the top , but enough to struggle with the maltiness for dominance in the brew . good mouthfeel , slightly less drinkable due to the high abv and viscousity ."

S"have n't had this since college , but the new look won me over . i needed an item for non-beer geeks , so this seemed perfect . pours a pretty light amber color with a little head , but nothing too crazy . smells like lager yeast ( clover honey ) , and i 'm sure the honey flavors are accentuating that even more . tastes sweet , but still definitely `` beer-y '' enough so that you do n't think you 're drinking something else . not much of a hop presence , but the finish is clean enough to know they 're there and doing the job . it seems a little watered down , but certainly a big jump over bmc . not too bad , and i 've always known this as an excellent gateway beer and summer go-to item . probably a little bit tame for a true beer geek , but this can be a life saver in beer challenged areas . put it in the same grouping you would yuengling ."

S'a friend picked up a 6pack of 12oz bottles for my birthday . i pour into my spaten optimator mug to review on the first one of the pack . an aggressive pour yields a nice quarter inch and rising frothy off white head . almost no head retention . decent lacing . color is dark brown on the verge of black . aromas of malts and dark molasses . sweet and candy-like with hints of over ripe banana . taste is similar to nose yet seems to be lighter in character . mouth is somewhat watery and beer is medium bodied . good carbonation .'

S"i bought a case of this knowing i had a small gathering of non craft beer drinkers coming over to my condo . i had to protect my cherished beer fridge , so this was the buffer . well , it was well received by all and i got congrats on buying the `` good '' stuff . oh boy , perspective is everything right ? on to the review . the appearance was good in my opinion . dark amber , clear , nice foamy white head that clung to the glass . i admit it looked good . the smell was grainy/herby , slightly big macro like . although i did detect a bit of hops in there , overall not bad . the taste was grainy as well . this is not my favorite type of beer taste at all . big emphases on the grains , not too much happening in the hop department . again , like the smell , there was an herby earthy quality in there . the mouthfeel was ok , a bit thin for my taste , but again overall not horrible . i gave it a 4 on drinkability as it was very easy drinking . although it may seem like i panned this brew , overall it was not bad . i would certainly take it over any macro ( except maybe sam adams ) , and it certainly is on par with beers like bass ale . a good session brew at a price you ca n't beat . certainly in the upper quality echelon of domestic macro 's ."

S"2008 bottling , aged ~18 months in my cellar . pours a finger of dark brown head over a pitch liquid . smell is mild overall . bitter and dry cocoa powder . clean alcohol and mild dark fruits . anise is very low , as is a nutty and wet chocolate . tastes dry from carbonation , baker 's chocolate powder , and edgy alcohol . malt is chocolate and almond . dark fruits of prune and raisin . hops are grassy drying with a bit of blackberry flavor . hard to tell about hop bitterness as the other drying and rough flavors are rather strong and could cover it up . honestly , the alcohol is rather piercing and unpleasant . after a while it really dominates the experience . light in the mouth and too strong of carbonation . not very drinkable ."

S"a : dark copper with a slightly off-white head that lingers leaving a beautiful lacing on the glass . there is some haze , but that 's probably cause the beer was bottle-conditioned and i accidentally just dumped all the sediment in ( long day at work and i was rushing to pour my evening beer ) . s : sweet malt with hints of honey and raisin . there is a slight alcoholic note on the nose . no hop aroma . the aroma finishes with some caramel and toffee . t : some biscuity malt , but the beer is fairly well-attenuated , finishing dry . there are some intense solvent-like alcohols , which are a bit overwhelming . mild bitterness . these higher alcohols are really masking much of the flavor -- there 's not much else i 'm picking up . m : medium bodied with medium-high carbonation , lending a slight carbonic bite . the alcohols coat my mouth and provide an intense warming sensation . d : this was a vintage-dated bottle dated 2008 , so i probably drank it a bit too soon . overall , those higher alcohols were the dominating flavor in this beer and were harsh at best . i 'm thinking of buying a few more bottles and seeing how it ages over time , as this beer definitely needs some years to mellow out . i 'll try to come back and re-review this beer once i had the chance to age a bottle for awhile ."

S"the `` best '' thing about this beer is its nitro-can . it gives the beer an amazing head , and is a cool looking shade of blue . everything else about it is disappointing . the most disappointing thing : it only contains 3.9 % alcohol ! that 's incredible ! i did n't notice that until i already had poured it , and when i tasted it i could n't deny the beer 's weakness . after the creamy head was a wierd yellow beer that had almost no taste . it did n't taste bad , and it did n't taste good . it simply had no flavor . not surprising when you consider that it is weaker than mic ultra , the tapwater beer . i would n't buy it again . if you get a chance to try it for free , do so , just so you can tell everyone about the weakest beer ever ."

S'this is the first beer review that i have posted , despite following beer advocate for quite some time . i recently participated in a sufficiently rare tasting event to justify writing up my experience . a year ago i received a gift of the 1990 , 1993 , 1994 , 1995 , 1998 , 2001 , and 2002 vintages of bigfoot . they were procured at stuffed sandwich in la . more recently i acquired the 2008 and 2010 ( sadly , 2009 was missed ) vintages as well . last saturday ( 100210 ) , the nine vintages were tasted vertically , from oldest to youngest . no alcohol was drunk beforehand , and only small amounts of each vintage were consumed until after i finished taking notes on each . several palate rinses over a few minutes were performed between vintages . a few general comments : the 2010 and 2008 vintages are both a rich red-brown color and have at least 1/2 inch of robust head from a strong pour . vintages 2001 and 2002 form and retain a small head . vintages 1998 and older show virtually zero carbonation . the 2001 and 2002 vintages are brown , while the 1990 to 1998 vintages are extremely dark , opaque brown . tasting notes by vintage : 1990 : nose : raisins , brown sugar , maple syrup . taste : a burnt , woody finish after hints of toffee and dried fruit . mouth feel : smooth and syrupy , much like better barrel-aged barleywines . general comment : nearly 20 % of the bottle was dark brown ( tasteless ) sediment . 1993 : nose : initial sour/rotten smell , suggesting the bottle had gone over . after the volatiles dispersed , a nose of caramel was present . taste : sour , rotten wood . sadly , this vintage had gone over . 1994 : nose : very weak nose of caramel . hardly anything here . taste : vaguely sweet dried fruits . nearly flavorless . mouth feel : fizzy and watery . not nearly as syrupy or smooth as the other older vintages . 1995 : nose : again , raisins , dried fruit , caramel . taste : a distinct but muted raisin flavor . ashy and bitter finish . mouth feel : smoother than 1994 , but does not approach the supple texture of 1990 . 1998 : nose : caramel , and remarkably , a hint of herbs . sage , perhaps . taste : tart , with an ashy finish . this bottle had probably gone over . 2001 : nose : a weak nose of rum and butterscotch . taste : muted flavors of rum and raisins . mouth feel : slight carbonation helps a smooth but watery finish . 2002 : nose : warm butterscotch and rum . remarkably buttery ! taste : mild flavors of fruits and caramel . the aftertaste is of earthy'

S"out of a bottle this beer was a copper color with one finger of khaki head . the retention was very good as a collar and the lacing impressive in curtains . the aroma was unique and unusual , both white and black pepper along with toasted malt and a little caramel malt tucked underneath . the flavors were also unique , with the peppercorns being clearly defined . the caramel and toasted malt provided a nice backbone though the hops profile was difficult to detect . the pepper and spice elements added to the acidity of the beer and i could n't imagine going through a few in a row without heartburn . the mouthfeel was smooth , the body medium and the carbonation light/medium . for those looking for an unique beer experience that is still done with finesse , look no further ; this one was like a brown ale on drugs ."

S'part of the big brewing family spaten-lwenbru-franziskaner ( owned by interbrew ) , which is easy to visit since it is located close to the hauptbahnhof in mnchen ( no tours i believe but a huge facility to walk around , two city blocks ! ) , this bier ( and the normal weibier ) is one of the most common weibiers to find on tap in mnchen . in the us i was never able to buy a bottle where the yeast hadnt become one solid mass in the bottom of the bottle . probably not a good sign ; ) i have noticed here that when i drink a franziskaner the beer is so fresh that the yeast hasnt even settled very well on the bottom of the bottle . huge difference in flavor and overall quality as you can imagine . on to the bier this bier fills the glass with a soft brown color with hints of a deep cherry hue.cloudy but not milky with yeast . a very nice head builds quickly and leaves lace throughout the session . the first aroma impression is spicy and of cloves . this is very well balanced by fruity aromas and the dark malts in combination with the yeast provide subtle raisin and dried fruit aromas . caramel malt and a slight malt sweetness are detectable . somewhere in there , although in the background , were small whiffs of buttery diacetyl . the flavor begins with a mild upfront bitterness followed by a light malt sweetness . yeast flavor was crisp and fresh but not overly bread-like . the dark malts are subdued . the mouth is between medium and light . this bier is very well carbonated to style . this is definitely a great drinking bier and understandably popular in the biergartens of mnchen . definitely a mild dunkles weibier , by dunkles weibier standards , but a very solid offering . i would highly recommend this bier as an introduction for someone who isnt familiar with the style . noch eins bitte ! zum wohl !'

S"a : slightly orange color and very clear with just a slight haze which indicates unfiltered beer . an aggressive pour did n't make more than a one finger head with large bubbles which dissipates fairly quickly . s : melon and pineapple with a serious pungency . definitely lots of simcoe in there and i get columbus as well . after a while i also noticed some lime zest and cattiness . t : a dramatic cascade of flavor has been developed in this beer . the brightest hop flavors sing simultaneously with the darkest , most pungent , brooding lows . a cantaloupe and lemon/grapefruit punch is juxtaposed to an intense hoppiness with a slight onion edge . the alcohol is front and center especially as the beer warms up . it tastes a bit woody and is strong enough to have a numbing effect on the tongue . i think the beer could have been more appealing at 8 % . i 'd loose the adjunct if it were me . m : the texture is appropriate for the style . very light for a 10 % abv beer but generally medium bodied . carbonation is restrained . d : big knock here for the overabundance of booze . i know its a dipa but there was no effort taken to mask the harsh alcohol heat . its too unapologetic and obviously at this level drinkability suffers ."

S'poured from 12oz brown bottle into snifter , no visible freshness date . appearance : vigorous pour produced a quarter inch dark tan head that quickly fell to an off white cap . beer is opaque black with a rich amber color appearing through the edges when held toward the light . smell : smell is what you would expect from a stout , malty with hints of dark chocolate and a little vanilla . no sign of the oak showing through the nose , but a little alcohol harshness toward the end . taste : roasty with some alcohol burn . sweet taste of vanilla , not bitter at all , with a slight oak apparent on the finish . very pleasant . mouthfeel : thick and smooth , medium to full body , not overly carbonated but small bubbles are apparent . dry finish , but something just not selling me . drinkability : harsh alcohol is only apparent for a second leading you right back to a second and third sip , but this thick rich beer feels like a dessert in itself . quite easy to drink one , but any more than two would be a challenge . overall , a very good beer , one i would love to have after a nice dinner in place of dessert or paired with a vanilla ice cream . not quite living up to the price tag to put it in the rotation , but one well worth a try .'

S"look : a pale yellowish-gold with a nice white head . smell : reminded me a bit of bananas , something fruity in it . taste : this reminds me a bit of the bananas out of a pack of runts candy , at least the end taste after you swallow one down . some citrus flavors in there as well . mouthfeel : nicely carbonated , but not the lightest feeling beer , it has a bit of weight to it . drinkability : i liked the taste but it would n't be something that i would drink a lot of in one sitting . overall the drink is quite refreshing and i imagine that it would pair very well with some great foods , however i 'd probably only be able to do a bottle or two of this before i 'd want something different . overall a very solid drink . edit : just hit the bottom of the bottle after pouring the last of it into my glass . very tasty , have bought it before and will definately buy it again ."

S"served at just over fridge temperature in the brewery 's traditional weizen glass . appearance- pours a murky brownish orange color into the glass ... i 'm noticing chunks of yeast traverse on their way downward and coming to rest at the bottom . the beer is almost completely opaque , and the head starts three fingers high before it settles slowly to a fat white hat . smell- notes of banana , clove , bread , and light phenols showcase this sweet , yeasty beer ... taste- the yeasty , bread-like character supercedes any flavors of banana and clove , playing down these flavors much more than many other dunkel-weizens . the overall palate is quite clean , but much more simple and straightforward than i like for the style . honest as always , but really basic . mouthfeel/drinkability- smooth but very active in the mouth , where the carbonation really takes off and begs to be paired with traditional german fare ... i could especially see sauerbraten or pork sausage with sauerkraut going well with this . the drinkability is excellent , where the flavors are somewhat weak ... it 's definitely a candidate for this summer 's session brews ."

S'i decided to finally crack this one open when the family was over last night . i have had chili beers before , but this one made me nervous to say the least . twelve ounce bottle was served as cold as i could make it and poured into 4 taster glasses . consumed on 11/14/2008 . at first look , the wtf is this comes across your face . pale , piss colored yellow liquid with virtually no carbonation or head . the only thing that set it apart from apple juice the the chili floating in it . the aroma was , i do not even know where to start with this one . it was a dull macro lager with hot sauce dumped in it , that was about it . then i took a taste , holy sheep . this was just awful . so insanely hot that you can not even get past the first sip . i have had others like ring of fire , that i really actually enjoyed , but this was just too much . nothing redeeming here at all . it took me damn near an hour to get back my sense of taste , and it was still not the same . a very thin feel , well what you could tell before your mouth got torn apart again , good grief , this thing was rough , this was one of the worst , if not the worst beer i have ever had . nothing here redeeming , even in a style that most may not like , this was at the bottom . never again .'

S"i 've come to the conclusion that not only am i not a big fan of the oak flavor , but i am not really a big fan of this beer either . it pours to a very highly filtered light amber with an inch head from a rather aggressive pour . nothing remotely exceptional about this presentation of this ipa . the smell has a massive oak aroma supported by a generous hoppy bouqet . the smell was the highlight of this beer , but still failed to meet my expectations of fresh west coast hoppy delight . the taste was dominated by oak on the initial taste and on into the finish . of course , the hops added a hint of taste , but not nearly as much as i would expect until late in the finish . the liquid seemed light and watery in the mouthfeel but very parched and ashy in the finish . not particularly great , nor is it too highly drinkable ."

S"a : outstanding appearance , head was fairly stable , which allowed the aroma to fully mature , and stayed for the most of the drink . the beer was poured into a wet sided glass as is usual with witbier . s : drinking this with my girlfriend , allowed me to hear a second thought on the smell that this had to offer . the original smell was fairly wheat hearty , while she decided to input that there were subtle notes of the pomegranate that was used in the brewing process . on a second smell i did notice the slighter sweetness . t : the taste was overall the most pleasant part of the experience , as i believe consuming beverages should be . the sweet , yet almost bitter taste of the pomegranate against the hearty wheat , was something that i know i 'd reach for on a day to day basis . i feel that this is one of the better beers i 've tasted , and i feel my rating reflects that . m : the overall mouthfeel was not as full as i desired , however , as light as some of the witbiers i 've tasted , it was n't too bad . d : the taste was overall outstanding , however , i do n't feel that i could reach for this beer on the day to day . it 's not your sam adams blackberry witbier , blue moon , or your 312 . that said , i 'd still recommend this over any of those . overall , i feel that this beer was a great purchase at $ 2.00 on the single rack . i do n't see myself buying the 6-pack on a regular basis , unless it 's spring ... it 's surely a light , and flavorful beer that would be better tasted during a season other than winter , still a great beer . cheers ."

S'what can i say , this was my staple in thailand . chang has a pretty standard golden apperance . head and lace are nonexistant but lots of rising bubbles . it had a strong alchol smell . pungent and tingled the nostrils . the alchol is not as evident in the taste as in the smell . semi sweet with tones of wheat and exotic spices . upon mouth contact there is a nice tingling sensation throughout the whole mouth . i found this beer to be very drinkable mainly due to price and alchol content . 38 baht ( $ 1.05 us ) for a big bottle at 7-11 . this beer pairs well with curry . and yes i did leave thailand with a chang shirt .'

S"22oz bottle into goblet at 45 degrees . pours with a thin tan head over a relatively clear ruby body , with tons of carbonation flowing up . aromas are unique and wild . green banana peel , chiles , cinnamon gum , and touch of raisin in the background . this one took a while to settle into . mouthfeel was nice - weizenbock like . flavors bounce all over the place . bananas , black beans , chile peppers and/or pepper jack cheese with some creamyness amidst the carbonation . bit of alcoholic heat in the finish . drinkability suffered from the finish , with the heat of the alcohol and the heat of the peppery quality - neither was particularly strong , but they did n't pull me back for another sip . interesting , no doubt , and worth seeking out if you want something really different . i 'd just recommend splitting one about 2-3 ways ."

S'christmas beer issued by multi-brasses for their first holiday season of operations . deep chestnut brown pour highlighted by lovely burgundy rays when held to the light . a generous head of off-white foam forms atop the liquid but dissipates too quickly . a healthy amount of lacing does stay behind however . aromas are somewhat overdone as a tsunami of ginger washes the olfactory senses leaving behind little room for some cloves and cinnamon , and none for any maltiness or hoppiness . interesting at first , but such a lack of depth to the aromas really hurts the aroma score . a blatant infection marrs the flavour profile right out of the gate as a rather unpleasant tartness wrestles with the spices for dominance of the taste . aftertaste of band-aids and wet cardboard are lingering and tenacious ... forcing me to dump this down the drain . the first beer i had from this brewery contained this same infection but to a much lesser degree , making the experience much more pleasant . this is sadly just undrinkable . multi-brasses will need to streamline their bottling process to avoid such unfortunate results . sant ?'

S"on tap at beachwood bbq . pours a great clear golden color from the tap with a one finger white head . herbal and citrusy hop aroma along with a little bit of sweet pale malt . the flavor is straight-up hop water for the most part ... and i like it ! supposedly this is around 3 % abv , so it makes sense that it 's not terribly malty . just a touch of pale malt . rather light-bodied , making it really drinkable , and very crisp . a nice concept beer . not sure where to classify this , but i 'd drink it again . would be good on a hot day ."

S'received this bottle for free from my buddy who bought a six pack , drank half of one and then gave the rest away . i have to admit that similar to bud clamato i have always had a sick curiosity to try this . my morbid curiousity never reached the point of actually spending money to try it however . lucky for me my buddies sometimes make ill-advised beer purchases . a- wild blue pours a syrupy dark purple , with a fizzy light purple head . does not look like beer . s- smells like cheap berry flavored pop mixed with a couple of shots of popov . t- tastes like cheap artificial berry flavoring with some adjunct malt flavor at the end . haha , the alcohol is well hidden though . if you told me this was bad soda instead of beer i might just believe it . m- thick , syrupy and unpleasant . d- this would have been my second drain pour ever but my girlfriend tried it and loved it . she said it was like a strong wine cooler . stay away from this one .'

S"ca n't say i 've been overly impressed with this brew at all . the pour is generally appetising , with a dark almost opaque body and a soapy head that seems to lace relatively well . the smell however while something to appreciate , is n't actually something that 's going to get you excited . malts and dark fruit are prominent . from a taste perspective , you 're greeted with an underwhelming mouthful of raisins , alcohol and sweet caramel . roasted coffee is also there , but far from dominates . over carbonated is the easiest way to describe the mouth feel , and a little too thin based on its other characteristics . it 's not somethig i could drink more than a single bottle of , due to the aforementioned dislikes . not one i 'd buy again , but am happy i 've tried ."

S"split a bomber of this with beerman207 on 11/23/09 . pour is from the bottle to a snifter . appearance : pour is a deep dark brown and looks like coffee ; starts with a full one finger head that is off-white and fades to a thin and uneven skim ; washes of lacing cling to the sides ; body is nearly opaque so i ca n't quite determine what the carbonation looks like yet ; slightly oily residue is also left along with the lacing . smell : for some reason i want to say it smells a little vegetative at first , but then it becomes much more malty with mild hints of caramel and chocolate ; a slightly alcoholic vapor to it as well ; smell is quite potent . taste : outstanding , of course , it is from stone . a wonderful blend of earthy hops and toasty/caramel malts ; flavors are big and bold -- not overly complicated , but outstanding ; aftertaste is more of the hoppy grassy presence than anything else . mouthfeel : body is solid - gums are tingly and there is a definite coating from the hop resin and the wonderful malt presence . drinkability : a little lower than i 'd like to say because of the abv being a little high , but it 's an amzing drink based upon the flavors , smells and feel . yet another winner from stone ."

S"i picked this up while vacationing in florida at a beer bar called `` world of beer . '' since this place ca n't maintain half their stock of beers on the menu , i finally found one they did have in stock ; it was a bit frustrating . i have always been a little weary of shipyard but since i do n't live in a place that sells a lot of their specialty stuff , i thought i 'd give this one a whirl . appearance : poured a clear , amber/dark orange with an off-white head and light to moderate lacing . smell : smell was slightly hoppy , rich with malts hinting of caramel flavors yet still maintains citrus scents and piney hops and maybe even a little nutty at the end . taste : the flavor is bitter and sweet , with flavors of butterscotch/caramel flavors yet still maintains a citrus foreground and piney hops and maybe even a little nutty and something i had n't really tasted in a beer like this ; almond . mouthfeel : thick and semi syrupy but not so much to hinder it 's drinkability . drinkability : its not super rich or overpowering and the flavors are fairly complex , making it fun to drink . i have never been a real fan of shipyard 's brews in the past . i have tried a lot of their mor common beers , like their hef , porter , and pale ale and i felt they were just okay . shipyard 's xxxx surprised me with it 's complexity and i thought it was fun to drink . it also seems like everyone has a bit of a different take on how it tastes , which i think is pretty cool ."

S"this interesting fruit/vegetable beer from the brewmaster 's collection of sam adams is quite interesting , but not the best . many things to point out . poured a gold/orange with a very thick and retentive white head into a weisse glass . fair lacing . perhaps a misjudgement and poured a quarter inch too much head than desired . smells heavily of cherry , wheat , some nuts and citrus . a bit hoppy . the taste is a mixture of cherry and wheat , then overly sweet cherry . it does n't feel like a natural cherry . has the intense flavor of perhaps a cherry pie . overly sweet , and it draws away from the other possibly complex flavor . the mouthfeel is very decent , and a high point to the beer . not a very offensive beer . this is a very quenching beer but the overly sweet artificial-like cherry makes this beer not as enjoyable as some other brews . still a good effort . i would not purchase again ."

S'now this is truly a wonderful example of a strong , complex and sublime imperial stout . of course , it is not the kind of beer you drink as a refreshment or as a session beer . this is the sort of beer that you kick back and relax with . it would take a while to explain all the different levels of taste in the tokyo , as it changes dramatically over time . but it suffice to say , that you will find plenty of coffee , chocolate , raisins , licorice and a beechwood kind of smokiness , not all at the same time though . in conclusion , if you like complex , delicious beers to relax and indulge yourself with , then you will probably like this one .'

S"cellar-cool 12-ounce bottle poured into a large tulip glass yields a midnight-ebony body with a trace of deep garnet at the periphery , capped with a thick layer of fine-bubbled oily khaki-brown foam . the head retains at a broken sheet that leaves webby speckles of lacing on the glass . the smell is chocolatey with a nice coffee backing , but a huge plummy , raisiny whiff of alcohol threatens to take over the aroma profile of the drink . the taste features ( or suffers from , depending on your perspective ) the same dark-fruity alcoholic character as the nose , with charred malt , dusty cocoa and rich dark-roasted black coffee working hard to be known above the boozy , fortified-wine-style heat of this drink . red apples macerated in dark rum notes emerge as the drink warms further . a nice earthy dryness denotes the finish . full-bodied and nicely carbonated , it seems to me that this year 's edition brooklyn 's bcs has lots of potential and would benefit greatly from aging . very boozy and hot right now with extremely limited drinkability as a result . i 'll let the rest of the sixer age a while , give it a whirl again , and , if necessary , revise my review accordingly ."

S'this beer is just loaded with all sorts of scents and flavours such as bourbon , molasses , and maple syrup . unfortunately , coffee is nowhere to be found . this beer , like the barley wine and bourbon brown ale seems to me to be aged too long in bourbon barrels . everything about the beer that was is gone and all that remains is booze and thick black super sweet tar . at least this looks and feels like an imp stout unlike the brown and barley ( which looked virtually identical to this one and tasted pretty much the same too ) . my disappointment with three of rock bottoms four bourbon beers is beyond words . the fourth brew , the redline imp . stout , was great . id loose the rest..'

S"very dark colour , slight reddish tinge up to the light . thick and dense ochre head , sinks steadily but looks nice , like frozen coke . leaves a ring of lacing at the top . not too special . otherwise looks great . smells quite sour , a lot of burnt notes , but not overly so . a hint of some unsweetened dark chocolate and roasted coffee , and a sharp hint of booziness as well . oddly enough blends quite well , but not perfectly balanced . taste is quite sour . chocolatey on the front palate , then gets a fruity , almost wheaty organic sourness to it , dark though , roasted and with a light espresso touch to it . does n't have a great deal of flavour , just hands out a slightly roasted malt and maybe a touch of oak as well . mouthfeel is not bad , very middle of the road though , not very full but certainly not thin . leaves a little dry , not bad . alcohol is very well hidden and frankly i 'm not sure where because there is n't really a huge flavour here , i 'm very impressed . it 's all well and good for american brew-bullies to bombard heavy beers with hops to disguise alcohol , but i think here they 've just utilised flavour well . very , very drinkable overall . possibly the most drinkable asian beer i 've ever had , in spite of being dark , and 8 % ."

S'poured a light copper color with a soft , white colored head . moderate level of carbonation was present . a bit of lacing could be seen in my pint glass . aromas of roasted malt , dried fruit ( apricot ) , and mead/honey seemed to come out nicely . the taste was that of malt with a subtle hop presence that grows over time . quite dry and a bit over carbonated in my mouth , but still good . the smoked/burnt flavors also gained strength as i continued to drink this beer . overall , an good beer , but one that i would not have several of .'

S'pours a reddish brown color with a smaller head than i expect . it diminishes fairly quickly . smell is sour cherries with some floral notes . there is also a good amount of maltiness in the aroma and on the palate too . taste is somewhat vinous at first but finishes with a good heat . there is a nice standard belgian effervescence as would be expected . it is a nice beer but i think this sample is not as fresh ( or good ) as the last one i tried .'

S"this is , in my opinion , a hard beer to review . let me say up front that i 'm quite fond of it , but i do n't think it 's `` the holy grail for hopheads . '' this beer pours a dark amber color , darker than i 'd expect for an iipa . very thin head that dissipates , but what were you expecting with 20 % alchohol ? considering the minimal head , the beer leaves a generous amount of lacing in its wake . smells wonderful , just does n't smell hoppy to me . this is far and away the sweetest smelling iipa i 've encountered . almost smells fruity , but i like it . a lot . taste follows the smell here , sweet with some slight alcohol burn and just a slight hint that there are hops here . again , overtones of fruit , but not the citrus taste you expect from an ipa . very delicate and tasty . the alcohol is beautifully masked , with just a hint of burn on your tongue , and it creeps up on you in a hurry . the aftertaste is even sweeter . i want to say medium bodied in the mouth , but it 's probably closer to heavy . but not imperial stout heavy . feels almost perfect to me . sits delectably on the tongue and rolls down the throat with ease . i want another , but the alcohol content wo n't allow it . this stuff has potential to hurt you , especially in the larger bottle . honestly , even 12 ounces seems like too much for a single sitting , but damn , it 's tasty . the last swallow is as delicious as the first . my only complaint is that this tastes *nothing* like any other double/imperial ipa i 've tasted . it 's overpoweringly sweet . if you 're looking for the height of bitterness , it 's not to be found here . this beer baffles me , and it comes back to the bit on the label claiming to be `` the holy grail for hopheads , '' which this is definitely not . that does n't stop it from being delicious though , so seek out and try this unique brew ."

S"review # 100 on ba . figured i 'd get there before i hit 1000 over on rb . this review is transcribed from an rb review , consumed in 2007 . paid $ 12 for a 1 ounce pour at house of brews on 46th st. in nyc . this is very overpriced , but less so if you think of it as a nice sipping liqueur . a - brilliant orangish caramel color with no head . s - aroma is caramel , port , courvoisier , dark fruits , vanilla , and alcohol ( obviously , it is 27 % ) . t - tastes a lot like a nice port - sweet with vinous notes as well as caramel , vanilla , and cherry . alcohol definitely there , but what do you expect from a 27 % er ? m - fairly thick and syrupy with almost no carbonation , which is actually nice for this one . liqueur-like . nice alcohol warmth without the burn . d - well , it 's meant to be a sipper and it is . really awesome stuff , but way overpriced of course . nice novelty beer ."

S"strange brew , do what 's inside of you . something wrong here or i just do n't get it . pours a dark ruddy copper with absolutely no head at all . if i had poured it harder i would have thumped it on the bottom like a bottle of catsup . the best i could get was a very thin topping of white foam that fled immediately . smells sweet , caramel , citrus hops , slight dark fruit . alcohol is well hidden behind the dark sweetness . tastes very nice , almost like a double bastard but the lack of carbonation makes it very strange . if i had brewed this i would have said , `` shit , it did n't carbonate '' and added some more priming sugar or yeast and waited another month or so . i 'm happy to add this brew and hope others can revive its rating if they get a carbonated bottle as it should be very good if properly carbonated . i ca n't imagine new holland would put out an uncarbonated beer so i guess this bottle is flawed in some way . i 'll try again when i find another one ."

S"appearance : it 's exceptionally dark . i 've heard it compared to used motor oil before and i have to agree somewhat . you ca n't shine a light through it , and if you get it on while clothes , it stains a charred brown color . if you do n't pour it correctly , it can develop a somewhat massive head . smell : it smells very appetizing , woody like a charred cask or barrel , coffee , and chocolate . all those smells are somewhat over shadowed by the smell of it 's faux carbonation . taste : i used to be a huge fan of guinness when i first started taking an interest in beer . i guess my taste buds have changed , or maybe my tastes are just more refined . for some reason , it always tastes `` flat '' to me , almost stale . and it tastes kinda like the ingredients are suspending in water . feel : it is very thick , and does n't do down easy , you may as well be eating you beer . drinkability : i used to be able to drink upwards of 3 of them during a meal , but i just start to feel sick part way through one ."

S'from just popping the cork i knew this beer was full of fruit . very fizzy pour with a huge opportunity for a thick head if care was not taken . smell had an overpowering fruity scent ( not bad , just fruity ) . champagne-like feel to the first drink . this beer successfully hides the wheat feel with bubbles . maybe i should have swirled it a few times to reduce the carbonation . 750 ml bottle gives me enough to drink that satifies me for awhile . i think it is too champagne-like and fruity for me .'

S"first , a description of the packaging . although packaging/presentation is not accounted for in the ba score matrix , as beer loving consumers we all have some internal appreciation for it . i suspect we all like nice presentation . comes in a sturdy reinforced box , as some liquor bottles might . the bottle is 14 '' high , and very heavy , and over 4inches at the base . you could stun a troll with this bottle ( and after sipping it , perhaps with the alcohol content as well ) . flouting the trend among flip-top bottles , the top is glazed ceramic not cheap plastic . i know the bottle means nothing to some , but it made me nostalgic for years ago when i could find fisher amber flip-tops around here . might have had something to do with using the bottles for homebrewing . the description is rather stupid : `` once a year the brewmasters capture the richest part of the brew '' . if they 're implying this is the first runoff from a regular bud batch , i call bullshit . they go out of their way to make excuses why this kind of beer ca n't be available year round because maybe they are too afraid people will like this . still , ab is to be commended for possibly introducing a good beer to their regular audience . deep -pop- when opening at 62*f. gray smoke from within . pours dark caramel - not actually burnt in color , just an incredibly deep hue . foams generously , and settles slowly until there is a faint edge and center lace . perfect in appearance . smell is weak - dominated by caramel maltiness , with only a hint of hop aroma . tastes full sweet rich malty goodness - what you expect in a doppel . hops are there but not overpowering , coming forward in the finish . the alcohol can not be detected in the taste . mouthfeel is just awesome.. you can just let it sit , or keep going for another swallow . mouthfeel is where you detect the rather high alcohol content . sweet and full , you can consume this beer at whatever pace you like . the co2 levels are very faint , even at warmer temps . this is a beer i wish were available year round ."

S'thanks to alex for sharing this one ! poured from bottle into nb globe . opaque black liquid , super foamy tan head that thins out very slowly . smell is wet wood , chocolate , some sour infected notes . taste is smokey oak , alcohol , chocolate cherries , a bit of dark roasted malt . it is hard to pick much taste out because the carbonation is out of control . mouthfeel is medium , thin and watery for an imperial stout with an intense carbonation . i did not enjoy this beer but would give it another chance since this one was most likely infected .'

S"i was a little disappointed with the light tint of this beer since the box says this is a dark amber beer . i disagree . bob 's 47 is a light amber with a maybe one inch head . the smell is of sweet malts with some light grassy hops . the taste is also light and sweet , which is good , but the malt does not contribute very much . i almost have to search for flavor . the hops are light but apparant and present throughout the taste . mouthfeel is a tad to light for me . just like everything else in this beer . drinkability is out of this world . i would liken it to drinking a sam adams , but without any heaviness at all . overall : this is a pleasant beer . it just needs a little more substance . not alot ! just a little . the hops are probably about right , but the malts are lacking . i would also agree with previous posters that there is a metallic taste that shows up sometimes ."

S"pours a cloudy , reddish copper . about an inch of frothy beige head . if you look closely you can see a few strands of upwardly mobile bubbles . i love the way the carbonation `` moves '' to form the head . very entertaining to watch , at least to me . if you can imagine a sweet , spray paint aroma , that 's what i smell . like an aerosol . i suspect the alcohol is playing for keeps here . the taste is less overwhelming than i expected ; malt is at the forefront , and it has a little hint of bready-ness . actually , i taste a little bit of an alcohol-soaked dark chocolate covered cherry . the alcohol comes through strong in the mix , the aftertaste is distinctively fruity . mouthfeel is a bit sticky but generally pleasing - this is a fully medium-bodied , creamy beer . overall , i 'd have to say that the alcohol plays a little too much of a role in the flavor profile : it dominates both the smell and the taste . that 's not to say this beer completely misses it 's mark - the dark fruit undertones are there , but they are just overshadowed . if the alcohol presence was subordinated just a little bit , this beer would be great . but for now it 's just ok. bottom line : i 'd drink it if you gave it to me , but would n't order one intentionally ."

S"big fruity fermentation character right off the bat on the nose . also dark caramel malt aromas and just a very faint alcohol aroma . deep brown with red highlights when held up to the light . smallish head but a persistant rim around the glass with a little bit of lacing . flavor is very nice . i get lots of dark dark crystal ( like 100-120 ) and a hint of roast malt . there 's also just a hint of treacle/butterscotch . fermentation character includes huge amounts of fruity esters that come off as plums and raisins and baked apples . hops are spot on for bitterness but otherwise the hops are kind of an afterthought in this malt complex beer . i do get a little bit of alcohol flavor which is the only thing that keeps me off a 5 . big bodied with a pretty sharp carbonation level , higher than the head would lead you to expect . on a quality/price/strength ratio this is a knockout . you could drink better at higher prices and you could find a lot of mediocre beer at the same price level . this is a damn fine beer that works as a sipper and as a food pairing with roast meat or spicy food ."

S'consumed at taco mac ( crabapple ) . ommegang bpa appears a darker straw color . the head is bright white with average retention . the smell is very nice , and similar to most traditional american pale ale . but the notes do lean more towards citrus and bubble gum than pine . its taste starts off fairly light , but the mid palate moves into simlar hops notes as the nose ( citrus and bubble gum ) . the finish is pretty sweet for a pale ale and it adds a nice complexity . the mouthfeel is relatively ligt an crisp , and the carbonation is a little high . overall , ommegang bpa is a very interesting pale ale . although most of their products do lean more towards belgian beers , this one is more relatable to and american pale ale . with that said it is super crisp and refreshing , and definitely a very sessionable offering from ommegang .'

S'presetation : 11.6 oz bottle with this cartoony looking snowman thingy holding a chalice of beer and possibly a mash paddle . appearance : dark brown color . slightly hazy and extremely effervescent . a large tan rocky head of tightly knit bubbles has incredible retention . moderate lacing on the glass . smell : beautiful phenolic aroma with a touch of caramel , plums , raisins , green apples , earthy , very light sourness , and alcohol . taste : a ton of pehnols come upfront with the light sweet malt body following right afterwards with hints of dark fruits and a spicy alcohol bite . fades away with more phenols and a lightly toasty and coffee malt aftertaste . a sweet alcoholic vapor evaporates off the tongue after the sip . the carbonation is piercingly sharp . no hop flavor or bitterness . mouthfeel : its hard to determine because it is so highly carbonated . it becomes really creamy when it hits the tongue . notes : the drinkability goes down because of the high carbonation . you can tell that there is a lot of alcohol in this beer , but its smooth . as with all the other de dolle beers , they are wonderful , a perfect beer for people who have drank a lot of high flavor belgian beers . i with there was a little more malt to balance out the strong phenols . other than that , good stuff .'

S"this is a staple diet of my drinking , aside the fact that it 's a cheap , drinkable beer , it 's also half decent . i struggled to produce a head on this light yellow , clear beer . the constant stream of bubbles rising from the bottom indicates the fuzzy mouthfeel i expected . both the smell and taste is sharp , something that i usually dislike in my beer , but the taste is subtle enough for me to down these quite easily . not a meal beer , definately a pub or bar beer , something to drink with mates ."

S"picked a 6 pack up the other night , never seen this before . i love it . nice golden amber color and beautiful frothy head and lacing . good steady carbonation . smell is nothing special , little bit of hops , mostly malt and honey . love the taste . crisp , refreshing hops with a good balance of honey and caramel sweetness . aftertaste is slightly bitter but mellow . good mouthfeel . smooth and wet with a little fizzy burn around the edges and a good body . it feels thicker than it is . i could drink this all night . this is a winter seasonal but it 's not too heavy for spring or summer . i 'm loving it with pork tacos at the moment but it would be better with a winter pot roast . i 'm not usually terribly impressed by new beers since i ca n't afford anything too fancy , but this was only $ 7 and it 's one of my new favorites . i 'm gon na buy it up before it disappears ."

S"i can spot a few bubbles , but no head appears . how can a ( white ) waxed bottle offer no head on the pour ? it pours thin , but the color is viscous motor oil . other than being darker than most , it 's fairly ordinary-looking . under ordinary conditions , i 'd rate a headless stout below par , but waxed , demonic marketing gets the best of us . the nose is a dark fruit basket ... almost like somebody smashed blackberries to make a new wine . lacking hop presence and foam , it 's cobbler without ice cream . dark licorice makes it smell like candy . there 's some dark cherries , raisins , dates ( which i also associate with figs ) , and plums . it smells like a dark , fruity twizzler . the taste has a slight malty balance to the utter sweetness i smelled . still , it 's missing a creaminess or bitterness that would really make this a better beverage . if you count licorice as a fruit ( and i 'm not declaring it is ) , the only thing exempting this from candy status is an alcohol burn . i was nicer on the smell because fruity candies smell good , but this is not what i want from an ris . oddly enough , it 's so sweetly puckering that it 's almost like a sour . i know fff is a great brewery and ( maybe ) this is ordinarily a great beer , but i prefer the taste of a grocery store stout compared to what currently sits in my snifter . though there 's indisputably substance to this liquid , a relative flatness confirms my suspicions about the absence of froth -- insufficient carbonation . it 's so very dark , but with a diluted fruit , alcoholic warmth . i 'll go with unimpressed on the feel but , with all the hoopla , rarity , marketing and , more objectively , the ratings on this site , i 'm actually disappointed . i want to try dark lord again ( perhaps another vintage ) , but i 'd be a fool to go whole-heartedly after it . an exclusive beer from such a great brewery that i do n't even like -- how does this happen ? i 'll finish it only because of these non-taste factors . i 'll point out , however , that i actually drain-poured a small portion to eliminate glass contamination possibilities . rarely do i drain-pour even a portion of ordinary brews , much less a brew like this ."

S"i thought this beer had a suprising amount of carbonation , and a relatively pleasant sour flavor with some complexity . not bad . based on the 5 seconds between opening this bottle and starting to pour , i concluded this was an oud brune , which might have some crossover into this `` belgian strong dark ale '' style . it smelled of sourness as soon as i opened it , and was very carbonated during its pour . color was a hazy red-brown . taste was very sour and musty ... almost like a balsamic vinegar . mouthfeel was thin , but not in a watery way ... more astringent , like gargling with hydrogen peroxide ( in a good way ! ) . i bought this bottle at ray 's liquor in wauwatosa ."

S"this is a good gueuze . a style i never would have thought i would ever come to enjoy about a year ago . the beer pours to a slightly hazy peach color . has a beautiful effervescent head that retains quite well . the smell is a bit dull considering the style . a sharp lactic tartness , with a hint of funky horseblanket . very subtle , however . definitely not as pronounced as some sour beers i 've had . the taste is good . a little sour tartness in the initial flavor followed by a sharp acidity . still very smooth . the finish is very dry with a moldy horseblankety oak flavor . could be much more drinkable , but it 's definitely not a heartburn beer . it 's a smooth tartness . sour and acidic without being vinegary . in the future , i 'll probably pass though . six dollars for 12 oz bottle is steep when i can find a better gueuze in the same price range ."

S"mama 's little yella pils pours a crystal clear bright gold . the folks at stone would say this is `` fizzy yellow beer '' , but you know in a good way . things are topped off by a fingers worth of white head . the head quickly fades , but leaves adequate lacing down the glass . onto the aroma . light in the hops department - not a great sign for a supposed czech pils . the aroma is pretty light all the way around . a bit of cut grass mixed with with sweet corn is the dominating aroma . a light lemon note rounds things out . the flavor follows suit in the lightness department . more corn and herbal/grassy notes . a bit of a malt graininess comes into play as well . there is some tangy lemon notes throughout . the finish is lightly hoppy with a bit of lingering bitterness mixed with more sweet corn . the mouthfeel is on the fuller side of light , almost verging on medium bodied . the carbonation is lively and lends a bit of crispness to the beer . is mama 's little yella pils a good czech pilsner ? the short answer is a resounding no . does that mean this a bad beer ? oh hell no . reality is this tastes like an american style lager . its a great easy drinking lawnmower kinda brew . it definitely outclasses its rivals like pbr . all in all this a great warm weather quaff ."

S"i had this 2007 vintage bottle on my shelf for almost a half a year . i wanted to drink it on an occasion and what better than the new year ! a - never really saw the color to tell the truth . i always drank it out of the bottle ( had this twice ) . i would say its a dark ruby color and after the first gulp it made a good amount of head inside the bottle . s - dark roasted fruits and chocolate . awesome . t - much better than the 2005 vintage i had at a bar with a friend once . to me the 2005 tasted of malt liquor and chocolate but this 2007 vintage had heavy figs , raisins , and sweet chocolate . m - as the beer warmed up the flavors got lighter and you could feel a slight alcohol burn but it was n't too off putting . d - at 6-8 dollars a bottle it 's like champagne on new years but much more enjoyable . overall my friend and i agree that this was truly a great brew and i may track it down and buy it again if the price is reasonable ( paid 6.00 for my bottle )"

S"absolutely my favorite fruit beer . pours out a very appealing straw gold with a nice crisp white head . very much true to the label , the aroma is of fresh peach . label says `` peach flavor added '' but the smell is very authentic , which is most often not the case with `` natural flavors '' . peach in the flavor , with some very clean pale malts and a very mild balancing bitterness that does n't detract from the fruit/malt balance . fairly dry , which is nice . too many fruit beers rely on overly sweet esters to enhance the fruit flavor , which comes off too sickly-sweet for my taste . there is some residual malt sweetness , but not cloying , and well enough done to enhance the peach flavor . crisp and pretty clean , without leaving your mouth dry and parched at the end . this is my perfect hot-weather beer . i would buy this buy the case if it were a little cheaper ."

S"i was served the vanilla porter in a sampler glass from the bar 's tap . it looked like your standard porter : very dark brown with a tinge of dark amber at the corners of the glass , translucent , but it sure does n't smell like a standard porter . a sharp , straight-from-the-baking-rack waft of vanilla hit me as soon i brought the glass to within six inches of my face . i do a lot of baking and though i would n't call the aroma artificial per se , it seemed as if someone had accidentally dropped the bottle into the batch and yanked it out after it was too late . i just could n't smell beyond it to the beer . the first sip gave about the same impression . a big ol ' smack of vanilla on the front of the palate washed through with not much to back it up . it was n't enough to make me recoil , but i had to look for the malty undernotes on a second attempt . they were there , faintly roasted . finally , as i took sip three , a nice , albeit very mild , bitter finish came through . this really was the beer 's saving grace , as it was the only holdout that managed not to succumb to all that vanilla . i doubt i would be able to make my way through a full pint of this beer ; the sweetness and sharpness of the vanilla was just a bit too cloying for me . i 'd have to call this an interesting experiment that did n't quite work out in the beer 's favor . had they toned the vanilla down a bitparticularly in the noseit would have been a much more drinkable porter variation ."

S"i had a very interesting experience with this beer . it started out great and wound up a challenge to finish it : settles like a true irish red and with a fine and creamy 1/2-inch head . smells of anis and caramel . i do not like anis , but the aroma is wonderfully complex . oh yeah , you can taste the anis . still , i am trying not to let that affect how i judge the beer . there are some solid flavors , but it is definitely dominated by anis . feels a little too sharp on the tongue as well . after about half , i 've had way too much of that anis taste . there are not anough flavors in play . my opinion of this beer just dropped tremendously in the time it took me to drink half a pint ."

S'vintage 1997 ? best before of 30.03.98 pours pale , hazy gold with a white head of various sized bubbles . the head never accounts to much , even with an aggresive pour , but lacework is decent afterwards . mostly erratic dots and a few strings of foam endure throughout the glass . aromatics are mostly higher alcohols , with a mild nail polish essence and other cleaning solutions . a very light malt wink lies underneath the brutal , boozy nose , and finishes with a hint of honey . the mouthfeel is pretty light for the size of the beer , and a bit sticky . nothing really else is apparent besides the heat that bares down . the pallet is mildly sweet and almost burning . pretty straightforward and alcoholic . no spice , yeastiness or hops . rather one dimensional . the cleaning solution character comes through as promised , but seems more industrial strength now . goodie goodie . a very light malt note along with some residuals is all that can be decerned through the lingering heat of the fusels . the solvent-like character seemed to build on the pallet , which eventually kept me from finishing the glass . i was hoping that 10 years would have helped this beer improve somehow , and it is more offensive than i remember . maybe another 10 ?'

S"shared with my brother , from a virtually unlabeled bottle . a : a little head , hazy , and a reddish orange hue to it . looks fine . s : wow ! the aroma is loaded - very sweet , like caramel , molasses , and strong notes of fruit ( raisin , banana ) and alcohol . t : potent . the alcohol bites and burns , and the flavor is mostly sweet , like mead - alcoholic honey . it kept giving me shivers . slight bitterness in the finish . m : ok , not creamy , but not watery . d : with the one-two punch of overpowering sweetness and high alcohol , i would n't think of putting back another one of these . half a bottle was quite sufficient ."

S'pours pretty dark , good amount of head . smells malty and pretty smoky . tasting it tastes like a bonfire in my mouth , its very smokey no joke . not bad either but its kind of boring its just a ton of smoke with some malts and it feels like it could use some other kick . otherwise glad i bought this beer .'

S"on tap at naja 's on 9/3/08 . looked good . i had no idea what it was but ordered it because i was curious . dark red , similar to fat tire , but slightly darker . smelled like strong coffee , maybe some vanilla , kind of hard to get too much of a smell with the two broads smoking right next to us . taste was like a cup of weak coffee . meaning that this was the most coffee i have ever tasted in a beer . it was fantastic the way the malt and coffee jumped back and forth . i was very impressed and shocked . i had no idea it was a coffee beer until that first sip . mouthfeel was good . smooth , very similar to fat tire . the drinkability suffered because the beer just got a bit old after a while . it was so intense with coffee that it almost got a bit obnoxious . still a very good beer and i would try it again if i ever see it , which may be never . recommended"

S"08 vintage . 750ml into small snifter . from notes . a- incredibly dark , a dark head rests on a midnight base beer . 1cm head that lingers . s- intense ! roasty coffee , honey , maple syrup and dark fruit . t- mammoth . roasted malts , bitter chocolate and fresh-pressed coffee . an assault on the tastebuds . smoky/ashy and bitter . m- thick , smooth , silky . sublime . flavors wear out the tongue quickly though . d- low but damn is this a good beer . i 'd drink it again . note- i had the 09 version and while not too many signs of it being infected i did n't like it nearly as much- lacking in flavor and body compared to the 08 vintage ."

S'brought to moscow by a syracuse native ( thanks , mark ) , the bottle is standard brown 12 oz , with a multicolor label featuring a golden chalice hit by a sun beam and frothing over with the good stuff . no freshness or ingredient information . pours a clear pale copper under a one finger beige head with good body and nice retention , leaving some quite impressive lace strings . the nose is strong of malt at first , but that quickly dissipates , leaving pretty much nothing . the mouth is quite prickly and fairly heavy , even cloying a bit . we start with a sweet bready malt opening , with a touch of caramel . the hops presence is strong , with distinct espresso bitterness . dry bitterness lasts well past the finish , leaving an acrid aftertaste with a touch of sweet malt to accompany . nice solid , if not spectacular , brew .'

S'poured cool and allowed to warm over the course of an hour . a thick golden haze with almost no head ... .in one word : stillness . aroma is a truckload of sweet bubblegum . when poured , taste is dominated by sweet bubblegum - the defining characteristic of gamma ray . a bit of tartness begins to emerge accompanied by subtle hints of granny smith apple . as it warms further a slight hop bitterness and alcohol emerge from the mix . not quite as complex as i was expecting . ultra smooth , almost creamy mouthfeel . not bad , but not a wow experience .'

S"like the wheat two , this poured a dark copper ( more like a dunkel than a pale wheat ) with an enormous head , which , to get more beer into my glass , had to be physically removed fingerful by fingerful . the nose is full of clove and banana . after enjoying the other wheat beers that bells does , i was taken aback by how strong this one is : the flavor profile is aggressive , bitter at times and very dry . the typical citrus and spice characteristics were well-defined but quickly shoved out of the way by a bitter surge as the liquid hit the back of my mouth . i thought that i would get used to the flavor , or at least that it would grow on me , but throughout the pint i found myself struggling with the strong bitterness mixed with the spices ... like an peppery dryness gone awry . given how great # 2 was , i was disappointed here . do n't search this one out ."

S"served in a bottle at room temperature and poured into a tulip glass . pours a dark chocolate color w/ very little light shining through the glass , while a nice cocoa powder 1 1/2 '' head springs atop of the body . spongy , but not so dense head . aroma is of lots of toffee malts and some chocolate and slight coffee notes . grassy hops come through as well as i expected considering the style . nice . taste is much more mellow and more bitter than i originally expected . not as sweet as most porters , however , the finish leaves a nice chocolate aftertaste in my mouth . also some grassy hops help this one out a bit . very well balanced ; the carbonation is light and the body is medium and a bit more creamy than most porters i 've had previous . this one turns out being super-easy to drink . tasty and fun ! i recommend to anyone !"

S'appearance : a finger of lighter tan head on a beer that is a dark ruby color when held up to the light , but appears to be a rather dark brown otherwise . lacing was present . smell : some coffee , and some wonderful roasty aroma with chocolate backing it . taste : the taste is super roasty , with roasted malt bitterness and dark chocolate notes . the finish is also roasted bitter . a little bit of creamyness . the roasted malt was a little heavy for me due to a lack of balance between it and some sweeter malt or even other flavors , which would have added more depth and complexity . i am not saying it is one dimensional , but there is a heavy focus on the roasted malt that clouds everything else . mouthfeel : medium body with carbonation a little on the heavier side . drinkability : the higher carbonation than i would expect and the heavy roasted flavor really killed the drinkability for me . i am pretty disappointed in this beer , which is sad because i was rather excited to try it after hearing good things about it on ba .'

S"a : poured a rustic-orange with a deep , swirling haziness and a beautifully retaining 2 finger linen white mushrooming head . the translucent nature made it hard to determine effervesce , but faint lazy rising bubbles could be sporadically seen . after a few minutes the head lapsed to a soft , whispy covering with a broken ring lacing . s : sweet caramelized malt and sweet oranges were picked up initially on the nose . light traces of fresh pine needles come through briefly and lightly while the beer rounds out with a final burst of fresh oranges on the trailing finish . not a lot of hoppiness was detected here . t : the initial flavor brings forth a malty sweetness with a burst of fresh oranges . again more sweet and orangey then hoppy as was the case with the aroma . the flavor turns tart , as in semi-dry tangerines , with a sourness of grapefruit juice ensuring on the finishing fade . lacking any transition of flavor , with a sourness and hopping of a blonde does n't give this much creditability as a pale . the beer label proudly boasts of using 5 different varieties of hops , as well 5 different varieties of american barley with none of them clearly distinguishable lending itself to a muddled mass of confusion and taste that drowned each other out into a generic bland and uneventful experience . to many spices spoil the soup as they say . m : a light creaminess but felt watery at times with a light musky sour showing of oranges coating the tongue . sour oranges and sour grapefruit juice is unimpressive as a finishing finale while overall the mouthful lacked a certain crispness . d : for drinkability had to knock this one down a notch or two below average . was n't an easy one to down , let alone enjoy . lacks a crispness and hoppiness of a good pale and leaves a watery grapefruit juice twang that made me grimace after every sip . the label concludes with `` this is a beer that says do n't mess with me '' and i could n't agree more ."

S'poured a cloudy copper in my weisbeer glass . four finger rocky white head rapidly receded leaving no lacing . smell of cloves and bananas . the taste is clean and refreshing . very balanced with no overpowering tastes that otherwise mar a clean taste and finish . a bit of citrus in there and some yeasty taste as well . i liked this beer but i think the the ramstein winter wheat that preceded it spoiled me . i will try this one again later in the season when my fall allergies have dissipated .'

S"poured from the new 22 ounce bomber bottle into my sam adams glass . a : a clear golden color with a minimal one finger white head . very light and clear for a dipa . s : hops and hops . earthy floral nose with a very sweet caramel smell . t : very hoppy ale ? yup . the taste on this beer is oh so unique i would love to know what blend of hops they use . hops start with a massive herbal floral hop flavor mixed in with some citrus like grapefruit and orange . a bit of earth , but the flavors here are mostly light and fruity . i think i even pick up a hint of vanilla . a nice bready caramel sugary sweetness holds the beer together and a super bitter hoppy finish comes at the end . bitterness really stays . m : prickly , hoppy , bitter with no alcohol . even a bit dry . d : high , uber high for a dipa . overall i ca n't believe i never reviewed this from bottle , so i figured the new 22 ounce bottles was a great time to do it . a very solid dipa that ranks just below the top notch dipas . still , a great beer that i 'm glad victory is now making year round ."

S"picked up the 20-ish oz bottle from food whole here in seattle , wa . it 's ( obviously ) the 2008 vintage , but at this strength , there 's no point in a wait of any sort . rather artfully done bottle pops with a big old hiss and pours simply into a handy pils glass ( hey , close enough to a wit glass , eh ) . body is remarkably clear for a style that 's usually left unfiltered these days . colour is like fresh peppermint tea - a hay to lemon yellow with a subtly brown middle . head is clear white and quite fine despite the big , fat , lazy bubbles that stream up all glass long . actually rather pretty - for a wit - as the style tends to be a muddy off-yellow these days . smell is spicy ! obvious use of corriander and some warmer , darker spice ( label suggests african pepper a.k.a gop ) . citrus notes ride up on very sweet booze , like a curacao liquor . malt does n't try to hide on the tail end of the nose , unlike many in this style , and is n't as all-out wheatey as some . strong yeast notes , as i 'd expect from a light strong belgian . tastes sweet and weak , like a floral tissane . spices are toned down to just the warming base notes . yeast and malt really prevail . . . you 'd almost think this was a beer ! does n't have the tang usually found in wits from abroad , is actually rather more smooth than most . heck , this would be smooth for a lager , let alone an ale . body is quite thick and not half as carbonated as i expected ( or maybe would have liked ) . coats the lips and palate , but not with anything unmentionable . in a way , the thickness of feel balances well with the delicacy of taste . jus wish it were a hair more bubbly . as drinkable as they come , though the larger bottle may cause your second glass to be unacceptably warm for the style . this is one that i 'd frankly like at 55 or below . all in all , not bad at all for a salute to two decades . more surprising still , i would n't have pegged this as a deschutes brew without knowing up front , and it 's lovely not to be pidegeonholed . the summer release , of course , is perfect for the style , and the style is darn well executed , if a bit untraditional ."

S"bevmo purchase of an uncertain year i would guess the last year it was made . lightproof inky black colored beer it looks and smells a lot like an old russian imperial stout . from quite some distance you can smell this beers more boozy element . sweet dark candied fruits and bourbon are the first impressions . intensely aromatic beer here with quite a bit of complexity . bourbon , figs , cherry , rum , coffee , muskmelon , berries , a little cinnamon and finally some black pepper . intensely aromatic and worthy of being a perfume , this earns a rarely given five in aroma . taste begins sweet and woody with a vanilla , chocolate , berry and caramel on ice cream initial flavor . intensely flavorful and probably too intense this is quite like drinking a thick syrup intended for a dessert . the aftertaste shows no signs of really quitting and is as complex as the beer itself for minutes upon minutes afterwards bourbon ; vanilla , berries and cream are still flashing across my taste buds . a rorschach test of flavor pretty much they are all in here including a faint ash flavor , mushroom and raspberries and chocolate . intensely rich , i repeat , like drinking syrup . mouthfeel is pretty much syrup . i however ca n't really call this drinkable in any conventional sense . just too intense , and far more intense than dfh wws of dreadnaught , this is a complete order of magnitude above those two super intense beers . this is more of a beer that you would drizzle as a flavoring over desserts or enjoy in one-ounce quantities at the end of a meal . an interesting experience and something i want to try as a syrup on ice cream and cheesecake , but never could i drink an entire glass of this stuff it is simply too intense ."

S"picked up a 1/4 keg and beers of the world for about $ 65 for a little end of the college school year celebration ... appearance is a deep blazing orange topped off with a frothy , light , slightly tan tinged head . smell is all amber malt all the time . sort of gives you a heads up for what you 're in for in the rest of the beer . with that being said , it tastes like amber malt . sorta seems logical for an amber lager . pretty thin in flavor up front with a dry/stale/grainy touch on the tongue that really does n't scream `` amber '' or `` lager '' but more like `` water . '' further into the taste you get hit with the same flavor as the aroma- nicely toasted amber malt well balanced with a little hop bite- i definitely enjoyed this combination . finishes fairly clean- i can detect maybe a little diacetyl if any but i do n't think it 's very important considering the darker grains used . my only real criticism is that for the first 40 % of the gulp you feel like you 're drinking seltzer water . mouthfeel is very light , with a little bit of body towards the center of the mouth . makes for a very drinkable beer considering the dominant `` aftertaste '' and generally light feel to the beer . i probably sat down and had 25 of these over the course of about 36 hours . needless to say , i think i 'll try something else now out of pure , amber exhaustion but i think it was a good purchase and something that will please a variety of guests at bbq 's or other springtime social events ."

S"this one was left over by guests . since i converted to craft brews a little over one year ago i have n't had a light beer . it so happens i had an extra lime laying around , so what the hell . no head at all , clear straw color . looks like it could be shipped to the lab and tested for tetrahydrocannibinol . not much to the smell . it 's basically grain and sulfur . it tastes like alkaseltzer and grain . seriously . alkaseltzer and grain . watery with heavy carbonation . not only does it taste like alkaseltzer , it feels like it . i gave drinkability a bonus point only because it 's compatible with a lime and limes are rich in vitamin c. vitamin c is good for you . overall , this is a crappy beer that really just validated what i 've been wondering ... has the change to craft beers changed my perspective on quality ? resounding yes . ... the lime was added after a few sips for a lime free review ."

S'appearance -- a clear golden yellow with carbonation up the glass to an almost non existent head . smell -- not to much really , slight grainy hops , taste- very light bodied beer with slight grains and hops , nothing really blows you away in the flavor . its just a very light in flavor and bodied beer , mouthfeel- light and heavily carbonated drinkability- the only thing about this beer thats expected to be decent at all is the drinkability as you can drink it just as good as you could any water you would get from the tap . got ta be a beer you have ice cold in the summer at the beach or something . nothing stellar here and if looking for a light beer even id still go else where .'

S"name says its a pale ale.. on the bottle it calls it a kolsch.. confusing eh ? anywho , a decent drinker . weird my package store just got this in as it does n't seem like a winter type brew.. in fact it 's the exact opposite . there 's intense carbonation in this bad boy , i had trouble pouring it without the head spilling over ( maybe my bottle was old/infected ? ) . very light bodied with a nice crispness to it . some slight hops are there but it drinks like a pils/kolsch as the bottle states . pale ale.. nah not enough hops for that . not something i 'd buy again but decent ."

S"well , found a bomber for $ 2.39 & figured it was time . budweiser is one of the beers that made me hate beer in college , that made me think beer was nasty corn-water that you had to drink six or seven of to feel anything . i went on to whiskey sours , long island ice teas , leinenkugel 's , & killian 's . it 's been a long road to recovery . but i ca n't pan something i 've never tried , so here goes . smell is spot on bud - thoroughly unappealing , with that lightish , corny , adjunct smell that is so un-beer-like . taste is somewhat better , not terrible , a little sweet , as if they actuallly put some ingredients into it . this is n't something i 'll ever reach for again , & does n't quite reach the level of mediocre . sub-mediocre , yes , but drinkable ."

S'the pour was a copper red with two fingers of head that quickly dissapated and left a thin lace . the smell was very light toasted caramel with a slight hint of malt . the drink started with a light caramel flavor followed by a very quick hit of hops and then finished clean and crisp . all and all probably a good lawnmower beer . very light on body and flavor .'

S"this beer came out a nice golden yellow thats was crystal clear and covered with a nice thick head that slowly tapered away into a thin head , simply put this beer looks really inviting.i can barely smell the hops in this one , but it does have a semi sweet aroma . it looks and smells better than it tastes , do n't get me wrong it 's not a bad beer , but it could use some work . when it first hits your tongue it feels slightly dull and a little dry , and its aftertaste has a bit of a dry kick to it as well . i can really taste the bitterness of this beer as it hits my throat ."

S'pours a dark amber color with a medium head and little lacing on the glass . tons of floaty stuff in the glass - almost scary how much there is . lots of hops in the aroma as well as a grassy and citrus smell . the flavor was mostly hops with some grass and citrus tastes thrown in , just like in the aroma . the finish is ... you guessed it , hops . not a bad beer . not the easiest drink , but i may have another sometime down the road .'

S"bottle # 05-1951.. stored cold for 3 months . thanks so much to mark & kristi for bringing me this bottle back from their colorado trip.. much appreciated . what can one really say about the apex of american sour ales ? from its sunset-like appearance to its nose full of bourbon-soaked sour cherries , the folly dances around perfection . it moves along just like most flemish reds from belgium , hanging right in there with the big boys . sour , you ask ? hell yes.. and not in an excessively vinegary fashion either . the payoff comes in the wood , which imparts a delicious lactic vanilla experience to the aftertaste . slightly underripe blood orange and white wine dryness define the body gist and accent the cherry flavor . crisp and carbonated , sour and refreshing.. this beer provides the ultimate experience in this genre of beer . there is n't too much left to say that has n't been said.. i did n't even want to take too many notes because it distracted me from the savoring of this masterpiece . if you have the opportunity to try this beer.. do so at any cost . oh , and do n't drink it on an empty stomach.. its a gut-wrenching doozy of an acidic belgian bomb ..."

S"all beers by coreff are non filtered . the ambree has a really dark color and almost no head . i thought the smell was kind of winy , which did n't make the beer very appealing . this beer has a low carbonation , and its taste is really bitter . it tasted like coffee , with maybe some hints of caramel by the end . in comparison with other french ambree i had , this one really lacked some sweetness . bitter was the most important impression i had while drinking the beer . i do n't think i would want to have another one after the one i just had ."

S"this beer looks all right , a nice clear golden color with a slight brown hue , topped by a nice white , bumpy head . for something with wheat in the name i 'd hoped for more head retention and lacing , but there 's barely any . it smells like a distant whiff of fresh picked raspberries being smashed by a small sheaf of wheat . the taste is toasted bread topped by a light layer of double fruit raspberry jam . only liquid . really , the balance between beer and fruit here is well done . my main complaint with fruit in beer is it 's either sickly sweet or it makes the beer too tart or sour , and in some cases when they use extracts it tastes artificial . but this one manages to have the raspberry work as a nice accompaniment to an average english mild , or something along those lines . the lack of bitterness could only serve to make this beer approachable to the masses , which i assume is the point of this kind of beer . the mouthfeel is medium and a little juicy . more carbonation and bitterness would be most welcome here , as a nice , crisp refreshing aspect is somewhat lacking . overall this is an uncomplicated beer and there 's not much to say about it . it has n't really changed my mind that beer is seldom ( if ever ) improved by the addition of fruit , but if that 's your thing you could do a lot worse ."

S'true to its bavarian legacy , the beer poured out cloudy golden in color and formed a large head . the aroma was a classic mix of bananas and cloves . the taste was a bit less sweet than anticipated , but extremely refreshing with a light spicy sweet and slightly sour taste . very creamy and soft in the mouth . with the approachable and classic construction and absolutely flawless execution , this was a joy to drink .'

S"341ml bottle poured in a pint glass . from collection 2006 a variety 12 pack from unibroue . hazy , red-amber in colour . huge beige head fills the top 1/4 of the glass . when i opened this bottle it actually foamed all over the place like a champagne bottle . big gobs of sticky lace . the first thing i notice in the aroma is the trademark unibroue yeast characteristic . it 's pleasant , but all the beers have this `` sameness '' to them that makes it a little ho-hum . sweetness , dried fruit and cake ... like a fruitcake or christmas cake background to the yeast . flavour is a little hard to pin down . there 's alot going on at the same time and the complexities , i find , make it hard to define . sweet malt at the start and a hint of alcohol . background spices , yeast and dried fruit tease you . during the carbonation rush , the alcohol becomes more evident . then the alcohol fades with the carbonation and reveals a spicy and yeasty dry finish . lingering aftertaste is peppery with a bit of an alcohol bite . nice and mellow and smooth mouthfeel with little pin pricks of carbonation until the aftertaste . the aftertaste is a bit harsh with the pepper/alcohol combo . like most of the unibroue products i 've had , this is a sipping brew . there really is n't anything to make me want to have another sip right away , but when you do take one , it is very nice . yes , it is good , but no , it 's not really my style ."

S"i ran into this earlier this week at the brewery in nantucket and immediately requested that ba resurrect this rare gem . so this is actually a 2010 i guess , unless cisco has been keeping this in hiding for nearly two years . either way i am glad to have run into it . it 's a beautiful golden brown color , murky and slightly a glow on the edges . the head is a light brown , quite stout , leaving a healthy trail of lacing . the aroma is a nice herbal hop that suggests dr. pepper . not much more to say , that 's what i get and it 's nice by my tastes in beer . the flavor thankfully follows suit with malty herbal hops combined gloriously . again i would cite dr. pepper but there is also more licorice in the taste that makes this more stick to your ribs even though it 's a sprightly carbonated and medium light bodied brew . this has a touch of horehound , root beer , all that good root family stuff that generally qualifies the winter warmer . it drinks fine but i do n't see this as a particularly session-able choice . but it is tasty and a wonderful surprise to enjoy in my brewery visit in mid august !"

S"appearance - the first thing that really stands out with this non-alcoholic brew is the head . it actually has a really solid , foamy , pure white head . it fades relatively quickly and leaves a thin white cloud on the surface . the body itself is a brass colored yellow but not very crisp . smell - the scent bring pasta with tomato sauce to mind . not very becoming of a beer . taste - after the smell i found it difficult to even take a taste . however , the taste is n't quite as bad at the scent . its simple and plain and kind of tastes like kix cereal . mouthfeel - the feel is cold and moderate . there is no real unique texture here but compared to other big box alcoholic brews i 'd say it 's just below average . ~ hopefully i will never have to have another one of these `` beers '' ever again . that includes finishing this one . down the drain you go ."

S"eye : color is a heavy orange hue of copper with some light sunset highlights . head retention is solid and lacing appears to be quite nice as well . the creamy head is more tan than white . all in all a decent looking brew . nose : first thing that strikes me about this brew 's aroma is the sweet and warm toasty malt aroma that emanates from it . also noticeable is a slight fruity character . some caramel malt aromas as well . tongue : this brew has a considerably more complex malt bill than i expected . at first there 's not much but the usual toasty and biscuit type of flavors along with the fruity flavors , however once it is swallowed a coffee/toffee/chocolate-i ca n't decide which one-flavor pushes its way into the background . this gives me the impression that this brew was mainly colored with a very dark malt , in small amounts . mouthfeel and drinkability : this beer is light bodied and has a dry finish . it does not as the head suggests have a creamy mouthfeel . it is easy to drink and as the beer warms much more of its character is revealed , give it ten to fifteen minutes at room temp before cracking it open ... in my opinion its at its best then ."

S'poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip . no bottling or dating info on the bottle . was rich orange amber color with good central carb streams . had a large off-white white that slowly settled into a thick collar and thin foam . great sliding lace with some sticky spots . the aroma was bitter hops , pine resin , c-hops and caramel malts . good but nothing unique . the flavor starts out with a touch of malt and then is rapidly over-powered by the bitter hops . very dry finish as well . i would have liked a little more malt balance to off-set the very bitter hop load . mouthfeel was thick and resiny . good carb and dry , very bitter finish . overall , a good adipa especially if you like the very bitter/less malty ones . i prefer the less bitter/more malty ones so while i scored the smell and taste to style the drinkability reflects my personal taste on it . been drinking more of the very bitter ones lately and am starting to grow into them so who knows in a couple years . rotation - avail here in tx . for now , one is enough unless i grow more into the very bitter hops . good beer just a personal style preference .'

S"aroma is a bit hard to pin down . rice or corn ? ? i know it 's a rice lager , so that is probably it . the first thing i notice is that the carbonation in this beer is pretty low . not sure if that 's common in this beer of if it is just this bottle . body is of moderate sweet grain , somewhat reminicent of american macro lagers , honestly . finish is of slight grain and a little bit of bitterness that appears on the side of the tongue . mouthfeel is extremely thin ; watery . aftertaste is almost nothing , only a little malt remains . overall , it 's fine for drinkability because there is n't much to it , but it 's just pretty boring . the taste profile is pretty barren and i '' m not impressed ."

S'this is one of the first big stouts i had over a year ago so i figured id finally review it . the appearance is a dark brown with a light tan head not much noticeable lacing . the smell is very malty with a very thing note of chocolate . the taste is the same as the smell mouth feel is pretty damn light for a stout of this size , but is still enjoyable the drinkability is just about average not great . a good stepping stone for me to the bigger beers ive been enjoying .'

S'from notes 7/12/11 . the aroma isnt incredible , but it seems like a good expression of the hop variety . it has a combination of pine , peppery spice and bland citrus , in that order of strength . appearance seems a bit darker than the first round of mikkeller single hops beers . its a nice orangey amber with an off-white head that sticks nicely . the taste has a nice malt backbone with some mild caramel , but its mostly hop notes . good complexity - lots of tasty pine and spice flavor . mildly bitter aftertaste . good full feel .'

S'sparkly yellow-gold . thin , soapy bubbles rise up and leave scant amounts of lace . nose is clean , precise , compact . toasty grain , herbal elements , herbal hop-leaf . pilsner malt . taste is hard to describe in its efficiency : this beer is brilliantly simple , ceaselessly pure , yet complex in its perfection . within this beer there is nowhere for faults to hide , like playing a bach fugue on an acoustic guitar . mouthfeel is like scrumptious , beer-y water . i could drink this by the tanker-truck full . beers like this make me wonder why things like bmc exist . its severely drinkable , simple , inoffensive ... but delicious . i think you could give this to a bmc devotee and a light might turn on ( or off ) .'

S"pours clear enough , but i 'm going to call the color muddy anyway . if that bothers you , well , great . success ! anyway , it pours this muddy orange color with a medium , off white and verra , verra dense head . still , a couple of minutes and it 's easing back into the glass . dinged for the orange tinge and the lightness of the color . it smells grand . a nice fall day ( somewhere that the trees lose their leaves - it 's about 50 degrees out and clear . just a touch of wind ) with maybe a touch of a wheat field on a hot , dry day thrown in . i 'm glad i gave it good points for smell before tasting it . blech . apricot juice , or something like it , and a really bitter middle of the tongue bite . finishes quickly ( thankfully ! ) and evenly . dinged for the horrible flavor . it 's a bit thin in the mouth - a bit much carbonation . as for drinkability , well , i 'm dumping it out !"

S"22 oz bottle split and poured into a la fin du monde tulip . 1.093 o.g. , 10 % abv , keep refrigerated , bottled in 2003 ! thanks to sweemzander for sharing this bottle he picked up while we were at martha 's . luckily , even with the 7 years of age on it , it 's been in the cooler . a - a tall pour creates no head what-so-ever . a swirl releases a thin ring of off-white bubbles . the color is a hazy apricot orange with golden highlights . s - huh . the nose is really strange . some fruity mango and light citrus hop aromas with a pinch of herbs falls slightly behind a bold caramel malt nose . it smells almost barleywine-like . a swirl ruins the nose completely by adding a moldy , plastic alcohol hint that made me shiver with repulsion . good aroma until the swirl though . t - toasted caramel malts make up the majority of the flavor but it definitely does n't taste fresh in the least ( obviously ) . apple cider is all over the flavor and hops are next-to absent but that 's a given with the age . a tiny pinch of bitter citrus . m - medium body with decent carbonation still . a low , lingering bitterness still comes out on the finish . d - not something i 'm gon na finish but i got ta hand it to avery ; this beer is still decent with the age on it , it 's just not very good . also , it should be noted that this came highly recommended by a cashier at martha 's who said it was fantastic even recently . that makes me a little concerned they were trying to get rid of one of the last two bottles ."

S"black lagers are an interesting breed , at least to me . black beers by usual convention are heavy , robust , and largely flavorful beers . there are of course many exceptions to this generalization , but you know i mean . black beers all seem to have a lush and creamy malt flavor that ranges from softly aromatic to robustly pungent - in either case all share a roast or fruity character . the shiner bohemian black lager is a bit of a different beast . firstly , the black lager is a lager rather than an ale . this indicates that the beer has been fermented at colder temperatures , and with a yeast that plays a smaller role in the beers actual flavor ; thus allowing the malts to speak for themselves . shiner , a texas based brewery since 1909 , has brewed the black lager staying as close to the bohemian tradition as possible . they have imported czech saaz and styrians hops , and used specific roasted malts to recreate a classic beer style that does not get a lot of public attention today . it was originally created as an anniversary beer in 1997 , but after huge amounts of enthusiastic customer feedback shiner decided to move it to regular production - and i 'm glad they did ! these beers honestly should get more public attention . it is a great beer to introduce newcomers to the craft beer world with . someone who is used to drinking flavorless , fizzy yellow beers may be to intimidated or overwhelmed by some of the bigger or more creative craft beers that exist - but the bohemian black lager is filled with flavor , but is masterfully smooth and clean in flavor and mouthfeel . it is just 4.9 % abv , and offers significantly more flavor for its alcohol that just about any commodity grade beer . i opened the black lager up cool around 8c ( 45f ) and poured it into a stemmed beer glass . it flowed cleanly from the bottle building a smooth and gentle beer that eventually lifted an airy and soft , pillowy almond and tan colored head . the beer was black at first sight , but when held into the light it reveals soft chocolate browns and dark burgundy hiding in the corners and edges of the beer . it shines clearly with a garnet black beam striking down the middle of the glass . the nose is soft but aromatic . clean and gentle scents of dark brown sugar , caramel and molasses open into your nose . soon a subtle hint of roast , chocolate , and fresh malts glide in smoothly . hops are very easy and only hint at a fresh and lightly crisp finish . this beer right away shows its strength as a session beer . it is clean and smooth from start to finish and offers up"

S"i wanted to like this beer , i really did . judging by the other reviews , you have got to wonder if we all drank the same beer . it poured beautifully . a very rich , dark brown with just a touch of red around the edges . no head to speak of and no lacing either . smell was strong and strange . first thought of lipstick , but after the initial assault found vanilla , coffee , floral notes , and , with help from a few other noses , narrowed the lipstick smell down to a toasted cocoanut/toffee/caramel combination that hooked up with the aforementioned floral to produce a very distinct but not very pleasing offering for the nose . taste was a little better if i did n't inhale as i brought the glass up . vanilla , roasted caramel , heavy malt , coffee and cane sugar are dominate . a nice complexity by an odd flavor . mouthfeel was very smooth , creamy but somewhat watery in the finish . drinkability : i could n't finish this one . the odd flavor and smell , despite the complexity of both , were very unbalanced and quite off-putting . if you you like a beer that drinks like root beer , give it a try , but do n't say i did n't warn you ."

S"my sister likes this stuff , and i have read lots of varying opinions on it , so i stole a single from the six pack i bought her . pours a clear straw color , and a tight white head that eventually becomes a ring of lace around the glass . aroma is similar to how a corona smells after putting a lime in . the lime smell does have a certain generic quality about it . besides that not a whole lot going on in the smell department . taste is dominated by the lime , but also has some salt and cereal grains . feel is light , and could use some more carbonation . drinkability is n't half bad ; i would take this over a regular bud light most likely . anheiser busch has created an average beer that has some clever marketing behind it . lime flavored nachos with salsa on the side sounds like a good pairing . cheers"

S"yes i really love this beer on a hot summer day . i prefer it with out the lime . there is no other beer i can sit around and drink like water . i know this is a below average beer and many like to slam it due to the fact it 's `` cool '' to drink , but in actuallity there is n't another beer that goes down so easily on a hot day . the smell is aweful but the taste is n't poor . i just wish the price reflected the taste because i would drink this all the time . i only drink this now if someone offers me one , or if we are getting tanked on the golf course durring may 5th ."

S'nice burnt umber appearance ( stole that from the painter on public tv in the 80s , rob ross , i think ) . head had dissipated before this beer arrived at my table . mild chocolate/sweet smell . mildly hoppy . very mild flavor . hints of cocoa and coffee , but nothing overwhelming . average carbonation . very drinkable session beer , as it is very mild ( and much manlier than girls light ) .'

S"my 750ml corked sample has absolutley zero carbonation . so i 'm already pissed at this beer for stealing my money . so , the review . the color is a crystal clear dark copper of the sam adams variety . no bubbles anywhere . the smell is good . very sweet and sharp smell with alcohol but all well balanced . taste is very complex and not nearly as sweet as i expected , that 's a good thing . so that is it . this beer took my money i 'm not going to let it take my time . the rest is going down the kitchen sick . cheers ."

S"appearance : pours a darkish orange with about two fingers of white head that lingers for a couple of minutes . smell : hops and citrus , not particularly strong but pleasant . taste : nice hops upfront , not the most bitter of beers but this is a ipa/wheat hybrid so it should n't be . definitely can taste the citrus . the beer just tastes really good . mouthfeel : very smooth , light to medium body . aftertaste fades quickly for an ipa . drinkability : exceptional , the wheat aspects of this hybrid really make this beer extremely easy to drink . although not the most bitter or hoppy ipa , encore is an interesting mix of a wheat beer and an ipa which makes it quite tasty and extremely drinkable ."

S"just came back from having this on-tap , and i was fairly pleased . it 's a sippable drink that would be far more perfect on a porch midday in the summer than inside a bar on a 55 degree brooklyn evening in october . that said , i still dig it . appearance is dark red/amber , with only a slight head . aroma is sour cherry . taste is that too , but there 's a complexity there that rewards a slow sample . goes down easy , but there 's substance in the mouth . in the middle there 's sweetness that rides over the tongue , and it ends sour , but clean . my first flanders red , and by the looks of it , i got my `` cherry '' popped by one of the best !"

S"12oz bottle poured into my chimay goblet . is this a pale ale or a blonde ? do n't think i 'm going to review this one strictly to style . the beer pours a radiant orange-yellow , cloudy due to a ton of suspended yeasties ( not that that 's necessarily a bad thing ) . the white head initially swells up to about a finger 's worth , but retention and lacing are both a little weak . the aroma is of citrus american hops , but not as pungent as i would expect from an american pale ale . there 's also a prominent pale malt sweetness in the nose . the taste is a carbon copy of the nose , orange and lemon zest at the close along with an upfront sweetness that reminds me of a belgian pale ale . a brief crack of hop bitterness falls in between the two and is a welcome addition . body is appropriately light , almost surprisingly so for the amount of malty flavor this beer has , and the carbonation is medium and does a good job of emphasizing the hops while not becoming too fizzy . the solid taste , restrained hop presence , and great mouthfeel make this an extremely easy drinking beer . a great effort from bell 's ."

S"presentation - 20004 22 oz . bomber with plenty of hilarious jewels to grace their bottle . appearance - very dark with ruby red tint that runs along the edge . first glass i poured ( perhaps a bit too lightly ) lacked any decent head . the second was much better with a small , albeit tasteful dark tan head that left a nice , light lacing on the glass , but all head dissipates pretty early on - i wonder if this bottle was a bit off , will have to try some others to be sure . smell - seems like too much alcohol on the nose . otherwise , a bit of grassy hops , a bunch of roasted malts , and something that just sort of clears the sinuses . it 's strong for sure , but not as great as its flavor , in my opinion mouthfeel - for me , this defines a chewy , full-bodied feel . very low on the carbonation , but fine otherwise taste - there is just so much going on here and i can see why it gets such high ratings . where to start ... lightly sweet malts start it out in combo with some of the grassier hop taste . gives way to a delightful roasted malt flavor that lingers for a long time . so interesting because even though the roasted flavor is so strong , you can always detect a strong west coast hoppy bitterness at the back of the mouth and on the lips . a very interesting balance . also noticed a strong currant taste with a dose of alcohol on the palate and warming the throat . ends with the aforementioned roasted maltiness and some spicy flavors to top it off . it is hard to do justice to the complexity of this beer . drinkability - i have n't had trouble finishing this beer , but it was slow process and would dread doing 2 in a row . while i think this is amazing in terms of flavor and craftsmanship , it is no session beer . conclusion - quite an interesting brew to try and i look forward to several more . something to have over or after a meal with friends , but too heavy in alcohol and flavor to consume in large quanties . make sure you read the bottle , komrads . thanks to aleoha for the bottles ."

S'this is a another attemp to bring a different type of light beer to the masses . this beer has a little more flavor than most light beers . good amber color , the carbonation is just right , slight malt taste but as usual with the typical weak waterdown flavor of a light beer . it is one of the better light beers out there but when you compare it to a another amber light like sam adams it falls way short . the best thing you can say about this beer it is easy to drink .'

S"part of nepa bc split # 12 . as this one is pouring i could n't believe how thick it looks . it looked like a thin syrup coming out of the bottle . rich orange color with some sedimentation , yeast maybe ( ? ) suspended alongisde slowly rising bubbles . the suspension and slow rise of the bubbles confirm that this baby is thick as hell . i 'm both intrigued and scared . it sort of looks like cough syrup . head is also incredibly thick and creamy and retains very well . it 's a light tan color and leaves a lot of stick , too . smells sweet and malty , with a good dose of alcohol and citrusy hops , too . prominence of the alcohol detracts . tastes like it smells , sweet and malty with some citrus flavor and a big dose of alcohol . i find it interesting though that for a beer that is so incredibly thick it 's not packing more in your face flavor . the flavors are subtle , maybe even a little bland for a barleywine , imo . rye complements the citrus hops nicely , and the flavor overall is good . some honey flavor , too , and a bit of spiciness to go with the alcohol . as it warms the alcohol gets even more apparent , and this severely hurts the flavor . it 's probalby a 3.5 on taste initially , but more like a 2.5 as it warms . i 'll split the difference and call it a 3 . this baby is incredibly full in the mouth but it 's to the point of being syrupy , almost like cough syrup , and that 's not a good thing . soft carbonation and incredibly chewy , but the syrupy factor really takes away from it . i had a hard time getting through the whole bottle because it was so unpleasantly thick and boozy . this is worth a try if only because it 's got to be the thickest , chewiest beer i 've ever experienced . but you can experience that in a few sips . it 's tough to get beyond that , at least for me . i doubt i 'd ever come back to this , even with some age . i have a hard time believing it will improve substantially in the cellar . the cough syrup thickness factor is just awful . just another strange weyerbacher offering that just is n't on point ."

S"this beer pours a bright and clear orange amber that fades to straw near the edges of my glass . a lazy field of bubbles sustains the dirty , off-white film of a head . beautiful ! ! smells of peaches and green grapes with caramel , cotton candy and just a touch of campfire roasted marshmallow . there 's also some vanilla bean and a beautiful oak and bourbon that rises out of the mix to round off the sweetness . the oak here comes through really well and appropriately . tastes of a light and sour dry cork that 's paired with a cantaloupe and peach sweetness and alight sting of sour , under-ripe plumb . a hint of bourbon comes through and stings the sides of my tongue . finishes off oaky and dry with a resurgence of the cork . feels pleasantly light and the carbonation seems to come from everywhere adding a lot to the body . the cleanness of the finish was a nice touch as well . another home run for new glarus . delicate , aromatic and clean ."

S"deep gold , almost leaning towards coppery coloured . very clear body . hard pour brought out two fingers of head , but they fell fairly quickly to a thin beige cap . smells quite malty , a strong biscuit impression . flowery hop aroma , but malt dominates the nose . the blend is pretty pleasant . malty to the tongue as well , biscuit and faint toffee . hops come across more crisp at the back of the tongue , but still this lager leans towards the malt . nice full flavour for the style . body is not overly light , but i find the carbonation a touch coarser than i like . good mouthfeel but not great . here 's a well put together lager . seems like it could n't have suffered much from being bought out by molson ."

S"just got this beer in at our trader joe 's in the seattle area as a `` hustle buy '' at $ 1.99 per 22 oz . bottle . pours a very dark brown with a good creamy head . looks very good . smell is of some toasted grain ( almost oatmeal-y ) , alcohol , chocolate and a little coffee . taste is good but is missing something . i am reading the label as being `` double black '' but i am not sure that this is what i am drinking . it goes down very smooth . i do n't personally taste a lot of `` coffee '' flavor but it is there ( the label is very specific with mentioning coffee ) . very smooth and enjoyable brew ( as the label indicates ) . my concern is that it is labeled as an imperial stout and really does n't feel like it . almost too smooth , for the style they are trying to go for . very enjoyable but am not sure it is as dark ( tasting ) as i thought ( and told ) it would be . i will definately buy more of this at $ 1.99 a bottle but would probably not consider buying this at its original price ( $ 4.99 suggested retail ) . a must try for the price"

S"so there i was , hands in my pockets , whistling in the aisles at green 's when joe sticks his bearded , managerial face out from the stacks . `` hey kkipple ! we just got in a new beer from mikkeller , check it out ! '' . i do and see an odd , paper-wrapped bottle sitting smugly on the shelf . upon inquiring as to its deliciousness , joe simply shrugs and offers the following words that were soon to change my life : `` it 's not on ba yet . '' well . i 'm a sucker for three things : beers foreign to ba and paper-wrapped bottles . actually there is a third thing , which is & lt ; redacted & gt ; so a mere $ 8.99 later , i am the proud owner of a bottle of ris a la m'ale . it 's advertised as being brewed with cherries and almonds . what will those mad mikkeller kids think up next ? two days later , during a halloween hair of the dog tasting , the paper was removed , and the beer poured into three flute glasses for the tasting pleasure ( tp ) of myself , todes and bobby8405 from the florida gang ( fg ) . ris a la m'ale pours ... well , it poured . it sat in our glasses an ugly pink-red , vaguely pepto-bismolesque and hazy . a low , floppy white head left a small amount of lace in the glass . this was n't pretty . at all . well maybe it smells ... oh no . no no no no no no . screaming no . please do n't touch me there no . the table let out a collective , staggered gag as we recoiled our noses from the horrific ris a la m'poop . words that were bandied about included : stomach acid , burnt plastic , tires , alkaline , stale cherry , `` no almond whatsoever '' , and `` worse than triple bock '' ( or black xantus , if you 're arbitrator . ) it is barely possible to overstate just how vile , how unappealing , how opposite of good this beer smells . it 's all bad sour and terribly , terribly wrong , much like that time you played 30 seconds in heaven with that brunette in middle school who had the swollen tonsils . such a let down , plus you got sick the next day . the flavor is , thank zeus , not as hideous as the nose , but there is still nothing to recommend here . a fish-eyed vague , watery sour cherry , a nasty herbal tongue-stab , a bizarre salty ( yes , salty ) finish that has you reaching for your water - all this and more await should you taste the perilous ris a la m'crap . mouthfeel is thin ,"

S"appearance - a pretty beer . dark gold with a hazy orange fading in from the back . head was a thin off white ring on the top . smell - you ca n't get much better than the nose that this beer offers . bursting with hops and a sweet honey , it blends well with the citrus fruit and melon that can be picked up in the background . taste & mouthfeel - falls a little short from what the nose offered up . hops are not as big as i originally thought , but if you like more citrus fruit in you beer , then this is the one for you . tons of orange , grapefruit , and melon attack the tastebuds . wonderful honey sweetness levels things out , but it does n't help calm what seems like an overly bitter taste . feel can be a little harsh at times , but does soften up when it needs to . drinkability - i was pleasantly surprised at that depth of this ipa . even though it was bursting with flavor it seemed just a touch off in some places . still a great ipa for sure ."

S"a - poured out a clear , orange color with golden highlights . it had a small , white head of foam that left minimal lacing . s - it smelled like a blueberry muffin , but not overpowering like some blueberry ales/lagers . t - fairly strong blueberry taste with some mild caramel notes . there was some spice , although it seemed out of place . m - it was crisp , sharp and smooth . a light bodied ale with a dry finish . d - meh . do n't need to try it again . it 's not awful but not very good either ."

S"when golden monkey is poured a nice centimeter head appears , but quickly dissipates to a ring with some foam in the middle . golden monkey has an orange tint with a bit of yellow shining through . tons of esters come through , some citrus and spicy yeast notes also come through , and there is also a slight bit of bready yeast character . while drinking this beer a huge carbonation bite hints your tongue , but a quite smooth estery flavour comes through ; however , there is a bit of alcohol warmth coming through at the end , which is to be expected . while lingering around in my mouth , i get a lot of a fruity flavours ; oranges and almost an apricot flavour are the most prevalent . only a bit of phenolic characters come through though , and there also is n't much malt to the beer . the mouthfeel is exactly where it should be ; the beer is n't outstanding , but a solid example of a tripel ."

S"presented in the ever-nostalgic 11oz `` stubby '' bottle that was put to rest by olympia in 2003 . pours a light straw color topped by a half-inch of creamy white head . not much carbonation in the body . aroma of light malt and some sweet fruit ( raisins ? ) . palate is nice up front , a touch malty with a nice bready character . develops some astringecy toward the finish , while maintaining the mystery fruity sweetness from the nose . body is light and a touch fizzy , but holds the flavor well enough . highly drinkable , and a good alternative to macro-brewed lagers ."

S"this is perhaps the most drinkable coffee stout i 've had . it 's low ( er ) abv and less robust-ness makes this a nice , easy drinking coffee beer . pours dark brown with ruby mixed in . off white foamy head , not as dense as some other stouts , but makes it look all that more coffee-ish . well , coffee in the nose . sharp rather than robust . a bit of nuttiness and cocoa if i think about it . this transfers to the flavors as well . coffee dominates but is not overpowering . not as 'thick ' as most coffee stouts i 've had , and not as coffee-ground-ish as others . this would be a great brunch beer , imho . fantastic drinking ."

S'my personal favorite throughout the summer & fall , one bottle stumbles out from hiding in the shadows . a flat pour , possibly due to the 1/07 bb date . still that heavy , flushed , amber that i remember . clean & crisp on my nose . quite doughy & sweet initially , the backwash keeps me constantly gulping . nice & mild ( quite mild actually ) , easy & satisfying . a staple in every sense . : )'

S"review from beeradvocate magazine issue # 36 ( jan 2010 ) : intricate crown of lacing on the glass , two clear shades away from black as well . slightly burnt , charred wood aroma with some subtle fruitiness and yeast in the back . charred grain is very prevalent but never acrid or astringent . hints of coffee and dark chocolate with some mild herbal citric hop . a little burnt sugar flashes some sweetness on the palate . well- rounded burnt grain character with some dark fruitiness in the semi-dry finish . beer geeks , let 's remember our normal-strength stouts . easy to drink and chock-full of flavor , a wonderful dark quaff ."

S"a hazy amber color with a very nice white fuzz cap and decent lacing . the aroma is heavy flowery hops with some sweet malt hiding in the background . the flavor confirms the intense floral hops but a few mouthfuls eventually reveal the attempt to balance this brew with a touch of brown sugar and salty malt . full bodied and lightly carbonated . i do n't see this as a session beer with such thick constitution and heavy hops . but this a quality hop concoction . this was pretty heavy handed in the hops so it might take a couple tries to entirely warm up to it , a price i am happy to pay . do n't miss giving it a try !"

S'i have come to the last of my oktoberfest selections that i purchased , tis a sad day and will have to go pick up some more if i can ever seem to get myself out to the store . so this one i saved for last . poured a nice orange tinted light amber with a good two inches or more of head strewn across the top . a nice slow fade left behind more then an adequate layer of lace across the top and some very nice side glass lace when it was done . smell was very nice , quite light and refreshing with a good amount of grain backing and a nice light earthy sort of hop tone . definitely some spices mixed in as there was just that little extra kick to it . the flavor was pretty much on point with the aroma . a tight mix of grain and earthy flavors mixed in with a good amount of spice , maybe cinnamon or nutmeg , something fairly nice and had a good overall fall feel to it . very nice light body with a huge amount of carbonation made it go down super smooth and kept it from feeling too filling . overall this was definitely a quality selection and i am glad i picked it up . superb drinkability and just a great overall profile . i really enjoyed this and will have to pick up some more if i can . one of my favorites of the season .'

S"pours with a clear , deep , dark , ruby-hued , burnt amber color that is topped by an easily three finger thick , amber tinged , tan colored head . concentrated malt aromas of caramelized malt sugars , raisins , prunes , biscuits and some touches of toasted grain in the finish are all noticeable , though the up front sweet fruitiness seems to be the most dominant note . sweet up front , without being sticky , this beer finishes with something that is slightly astringent . this seems to be a mix of hop notes and something else i ca n't quite put my finger on . notes of raisins , a touch of berry flavors are what is really noticeable from the malt . these notes are balanced a bit by a minty , herbal hop character and perhaps something that hints at some plastic-like phenolics , though just barely . the beer has a nice heft to it ; a medium body helps it to stick to the palate just a bit . not a bad beer , and it is even enjoyable . it does seem to be on the edge of having an off flavor though , though not quite ; i wonder if just a hint of peat malt was added here , not enough to really taste , but enough to effect the overall character of this beer ."

S"i visited the anchor bar in the buffalo airport ( an off shoot of the anchor bar , inventor of the buffalo wing ) ; the wings were excellent , but the beer selection was sub-par . this happened to be the only beer they carried that i had n't reviewed , and it is the beer drinker 's light beer , so i figured i 'd give it a whirl . a : pale straw and clear , surprisingly nice retention and lace on the 1.5 finger white head that separates it ( slightly ) from typical macrolagers . 3/5 s : grainy and lagerish . astringent hint and medium strength . 2/5 t : grainy malt tasting with an astringent/sour apple hint . a small yet indistinct hit finishes this one . decent strength to the flavor for a light beer . 2.5/5 m : thin and carbonated . unimpressive . 1.5/5 d : what else are light beers if not inherently drinkable ? 5/5 overall impression : i suppose if i had to have a light beer and yuengling light is out of the question , i 'd go with amstel light . i hear the calories are low as well ."

S"bottle into snifter a : mahogany with a short-lived off-white head . it does stick to the sides of the glass , but i ca n't get it to form much of a head to start with . s : cherry candy , belgian yeast , and alcohol ... in that order . t : slight malty sweetness , spicy yeast -- typical belgian dark flavors . but then there 's this mix of cherry candy and medicinal alcohol that , depending on the temperature and the glassware , can be either awesome or revolting . so it either tastes like a belgian strong dark with cherries or malty cough syrup . snifter/cellar temperature seems to be ideal for getting it towards the `` awesome '' side . m : the only word that came to mind when i thought about mouthfeel was `` syrupy . '' it 's not highly carbonated , and that actually helps . if this beer were to be highly carbonated , it could be easily confused with cherry soda . d : goes down easy when kept at proper temperature in appropriate glassware . but it 's also 11 % abv , so it will knock you on your ass pretty much without warning . for that quality alone , i do not recommend this as a session beer ."

S"now this is what i am talkin ' about . a fellow ba once said to me that the true measure of a beer is in its malt . i agree . while an ipa can be hopped to high heaven , if it does n't have a malt base to support those hops it is little better than hop tea with some vodka thrown in . now , this beer managed to be better than that . pouring a pale gold with a fluffy white head ( that lingers for quite some time ! ) the raw smell of piney and earthy hops fill the room ! a wondrous marriage of continental and american hops ! mmmm . the taste follows the smell , a wonderful union of hops balanced by malt that is sweet enough and complex enough to keep you engaged without really dwelling on it . think of a pilsner , but thick and chewy with a little sweet thrown in at the end . a watered down imperial pilsner , perhaps ? all that with layer upon layer of hops and a crushingly bitter finish . another great brew from great lakes . come back to indiana !"

S"well , what to say ... this one poured a hazey yellow with a thin head . the smell reminded me of halls honey lemon cough drops . that was the initial flavor of the taste as well . dissolved white sugar , ginger , and some funk follow . not really pleasing in any way . the mouthfeel felt oddly grainy . i 'm not sure i 'll finish this one , so i 'll have to say the drinkability is very low . i appreciate samuel adams ' adventurous brewing , but this one was probably best left in colonial times ."

S"an easy-drinking palate , offering honey to taste , but without being really convincing . honey is also present in the nose , in a style more grilled . the body is a little too soft and watery to really satisfy . moreover , the lack of bitterness , often characteristic of fuller 's brewery is also disadvantageous . a model of honey ale , which gives an impression of poorly controlled , perhaps due to the absence of a higher abv to compensate for the missing body , which remains light years ahead of belgian models ."

S'one of the 21 beers i brough back from belgium . this one was bottled in 2006 . i shared it with some friends back in tallahassee . poured into a wine glass . a - pours a nice semi cloudy yellow color . almost no head , but with a bit of carbonation fizz popping at the top . s - holy cow , one of the best smelling guezes ive had . big on the sour end , with a bit of earthiness , and footiness ( thought the footy aroma is not overpowering like it can be in other geuezes ) . slightly lemony and sweet at the end . t - this one will make you pucker . hugely sour , extremely tart . i absolutely love it . sweetness is more apparent in the taste than in the smell . lemony with a bit of grapefruit in the core ( though not hoppy grapefruit ) . finishes slightly grassy . just when you think you wont taste the earthy , footy smell that was in the nose , it is there as the beer warms and rolls over the back of your tounge . i love this beer . m - very light , however it does not feel thick or chewy despite the low carbonation . nice mouthfeel , anything heavier would have detracted from the sourness . d - this beer is not the most drinkable . i could probably go for one 750ml bottle in a sitting , though the sitting would at least be an hour long . i love the sour flavor , but i can only sip this beer ( seems strange for a beer that is only 5 % ) . i love this beer , and i want more .'

S"500 ml bottle into pint glass , best before sept 06 , sampled 24 oct 05 . double dragon pours disturbingly like root beer , with prominent carbonation and a medium , off-white head leaving sparse lacing over a leather-brown clear body . the nose is entirely malt , no hops , with peaches a pleasing undertone and hints of vanilla & oak . the flavor is very much in the welsh style : quite malty , with faint bitterness and undertones of oak , banana , cooking apple and dark plum under a thick layer of pure barley ; overall it 's reminiscent of some scottish ales i 've tried in that hops is quite subtle and the beer is only vaguely acidic . the flavor is similar to that found in cwrw hf [ http : //beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/8405/26553/ ] and the drink finishes with a malty aftertaste with indistinctly fruity notes ascendant . carbonation disperses quickly and is quite mild in the mouth . the body itself is exceptionally thick , almost oily . double dragon is like a thinner versoin of felinfoel 's thames welsh esb [ http : //beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1310/3535/ ] . i 'd call this drink and its allies an acquired taste , but certainly something i 'll be exploring further in the future ."

S"billiantly clear light auburn hue . topped by a creamy , steadfast ivory white head that yields dense , sticky lace . soft toasted malt with a buttery twang upfront in aroma . secondary are notes of light lovibond caramel and herbal , slightly leafy hallertauer . stately and well rounded aromawise . initially in flavor is a mellow wash of simple toffee , which yields to a deeper combination of caramelized pecan and floral hop hints . surprisingly assertive hop bitterness surfaces mid palate and more than offsets residual sweetness , lending a thirst quenching mineral dryness . hard water ? stable in flavor as it breathes , with only trace maple and biscuit hints surfacing and complementing . lightly bodied , with a lightly viscous , rather brisk mouthfeel conducive to easy drinking . finishes dry , with quickly fleeting malt derived butterscotch hints . a well crafted , enjoyable hellesbock that 's simple in overall character and soft on the palate . certainly a beer i could drink a lot of . thanks for feloniousmonk for the delivery !"

S"green glass bottle , says `` labtrobe brewing co. st. louis mo '' . uh right ... a-b has many names , eh ? appears crystal clear , a super pale yellow color , frothy white head . actually a bit of lacing . smell is that typical off-putting adjuct lager aroma . not much taste , maybe a little sweet corn . no hops . not bad , just bland . fizzy , water thin body . super clean aftertaste . would n't normally drink this beer , got it for free ( long story ) . but for an adjuct lager , it 's certainly less offensive than the `` big three '' , as it is just basically tasteless . you could drink it like water on a hot day , so ca n't get more drinkable . so my scores here are `` to style '' . it 's been so many years since i last had this , so i ca n't remember if it was much different went it was brewed in good 'ole pa ."

S"in a thinly veiled attempt to bump my countries reviewed stats up a notch , it 's coopers sparkling ale time . i hope it 's better than i remember . bought refrigerated at a summerhill lcbo in toronto , kept refrigerated since then , and with a best before date somewhere in 2011 . a careful pour leaves the lees behind in the bottle resulting in a nice , clear , golden orange ale with a thin , nicely retaining head . minimal head retention . zero lacing . smells mildly skunked , and i get more of a belgian pale ale than an english pale ale from the aroma . hints of lemongrass and sweetly toasted malt and some earthy hops same for the taste . the yeast dominates and imparts more of a beligain aspect than anything english . there 's something fruity and appley and waxy about it . finishes dry . the carbonation level is high and keeps things light and spritzy and might almost be a blessing in how it detracts from the taste . yeah . turns out , two or so years later i still do n't like this . i do n't think i 'll ever come back to it for any reason ."

S"love the purple label , makes the bottle stick out on a shelf . this pours a dark ruby color with slightly off white head that just billows in my hefe glass . just from the 16.9 oz . bottle it felt like i had to do a guinness pour just to get the whole damn bottle in the glass . good off the bat . the smell has a whisk of alcohol to it already and this is dead `` bock '' cold , and it shows in the taste right after the immediate sip is taken . has alot of character to it underneath though , its just the alcohol masks it fairly heavily unfortunately ... absolutely love the wheat influence ! ! ! the mouthfeel is quite good , and makes for an interesting mix of wheat ale character and bock sweetness . a very interesting beer , however not my style . well ... not yet at least . i recommend it as something every ba should try ."

S'thanks to jw347 for this extra in a recent trade ; opened this bottle tonight at la bella with joey and danny . pours a dark orange color with a thin head on top . big aroma of oak , vanilla , honey , nutty malts , walnuts , and some maple syrup . tasted of clover honey upfront , caramel and crystal malts in abundance ! oak , sweet orange at mid-palate . kind of baleywine-like in the finish . very sweet in the finish too , not enough balance there . medium-low carbonation but works well for the beer . a bit too sweet for my taste though .'

S"a delightful ipa , and of the sorts rarely found here amongst san diego 's rarefied ipa 's . light amber in color with a thin head . no notable citrus presence . not overly carbonated as perhaps occurs in the bottle vs. tap . initial barleywine notes , likely due to relatively high abv . this is quickly overtaken with subtle licorice and coffee overtones , with the coffee lingering . very subtle however , unlike a coffee porter for example . and very deceiving , as it is rather effective in masking the hoppieness and the strength present in the beer . all in all a very fine brew , but the chewy malty finish makes too much of a meal out of this one , limiting drinkability , particularly in conjunction with the 9 % factor ."

S'as one who is a big fan hoped up brews it is with trepadation that i write this review . i realize that it is a double ipa but this is is out of whack and overdone . it looks ver ; y nice poured into a glass ( ugly flying dog bottle aside ) . a cloudy amber color with a big thick staying head . the smell has tons of citrus hop tones to it but the alcohol is noticable . very little harmony with the flavor . hard core hops which i usually like but the alcohol kick in the ass afterward makes me cringe . when people talk of over the top beers this should be one of the first mentioned .'

S"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a chimay goblet . bottled on 4 jan 2008 consumed on 29 feb 2008 a - pours a smooth dark brown with a hint of ruby . nice color . single-finger head that grows a bit with a nice swirl in the goblet . lacing is nonexistent . s - molasses is the first thing that hits my nostrils - rich and sweet . also smell of dark malts . the smell is very similar to other belgian beer i 've sampled . i 'm digging for a hint of the raisin smell , and i only catch a note . not nearly as prominent as i 'd expected . t - the belgian candi sugar and dark malts are nice and sweet . i get a slight hint of the raisins i 've been searching for on the back of the tongue . overall , i think the sweetness is just about right . m - the mouthfeel is pretty heavy , which is to be expected when purchasing an 8 % abv beer . i feel that the heaviness and the high carbonation balance well with the sweetness of the beer . d - i 'll have to say that i 'm glad that i only bought a single rather than a 6 pack . however , i disagree with the way that the drinkability of the beer itself can deduct points . i feel that a beer can be very tasty without being able to drink more than one per sitting , which i think the case is here . this is a great beer from dogfish head , and definitely worth a try ."

S'samuel adams chocolate bock pours a nice rich dark brown , with a solid thick white head that falls to a halo of lace relatively quick . you can tell this is thick . smell is dominated by chocolate , with some floral backings . taste reminds me a lot of snickers , or fudge , or chocolate marble slab ice cream . intensely chocolaty with notes of roasted malts , cream , slight vanilla , cocoa powder , and sugar . some small notes of citrus/floral twang near the finish . this is a delicious desert beer . really intense chocolate flavors make this one hell of a night cap . pretty straight forward , not very complex . still quite drinkable , and recommended to at least try once .'

S"let 's end 2009 in style ... .with champagne beer ! 2006 edition , per label . on to the beer : sparkling paleish golden color . it forms a huge bubbly , soapy white head on top . great head retention . the aroma is very interesting . it is light overall , but very rustic . it smells like a complex saison to me . it is very dry , with rye , lemon , spearmint , oddball herbs you would only find in cooking . dues is much different from any other beer i 've tasted . it 's my first champagne beer , so maybe that 's why . peppery , rye , thyme , lemon in the begining . minty . the overall flavor is n't heavy at all . there is a small kick of alcohol , though it is n't fusel or anything unwanted . in fact , it seems to go with the flavor with it 's warming feel . very highly carbonated , but i would assume that it is `` to style '' . this is especially true at lower temperatures . light in the body . i was expecting a much different journey with deus . in honesty , i do n't drink champagne , so i really had no idea where this beer would go . it sure is interesting though , but i 'd only want a little at a time . it looks like i 'll be sipping on the 750 ml bottle until the new year ."

S"beer shows up a beautiful clear copper color with billowy puffed head that is completely gone by the time i 'm halfway done . nose i get big hop aroma here . definately makes me think of homebrewing , smells just like hop pellets i 've used when they come out of the fridge . its odd that this beer has retained that raw aroma . guess thats what happens when you dry hop with liberty . i also get a lucious fruity backend in the aroma , but it is n't typical ale fruit , its more like a peach or apricot ( some fruit of `` the fuzzy family '' ) . also has a nice kick of hop spice . kinda funky but very appetizing . the taste is a sweet but resinous/ piney kind of base with faint spices , and peach or apricot and maybe pineapple all popping in and out in turns . great depth of malt flavor with signature new belgium toasted complexity . hop spice lingers in aftertaste . as the pint warms and i dink more , i find that dry-hopped liberty aroma really coming through in the taste . i feel like i 'm practically drinking those hop pellets . its beginning to beat down some of the fruit and while i find this flavor interesting as a brewer , it gets a little pushy for me as a drinker . i feel this would be worthy of the title `` double esb '' since it 's flavors are so big and work together on a basis of contrast , rather than the subtle synergies of traditional examples of the style . mouthfeel is thick but has some carbonation and is approprite . very good , very different beer , but i would really struggle to get more than one of these down in a night . its kind of exhausting . this is a beer i like to revisit year-to-year . it is so unique and it is actually an effective winter brew despite staying just on the light side of the style spectrum ."

S"i bought a 12 pack sampler and this was one of the brews . pours an orange-amber color with little head . nose is strong with ginger , not particularly inspiring . tasting reveals an odd flavor , a bit of maltiness and hops , but the ginger overpowers the taste and makes for an unpleasant drinking experience . did n't make it to the drain , but i 'm not looking forwards to drinking the rest . maybe if they lose the ginger it would be a tastier brew , but i did n't care for this one at all ."

S"nice dark brown amber , not too impressive in the head , but at almost 12 % abv whaddaya want ? slight tan lacing , oiliness coats side of glass on the swirl . i like that ! ! he he nice roasty hops aromas , followed by wine-like grapey aroma . more than moderately sweet . alcohol evident to the point of almost being overwhelming . come coffee , chocolate , spiced fruits , and caramel mingle through . again , ... nice ( boy do i need a thesaurus ) hops . nice sweetness . gives me a `` full-mouth '' taste . oily ! nice ! ! fruitiness , mainly grapes . alcohol . nothing overwhelming , but complex flavors blend well to form a delicious tasting beer . grapes linger . exceptional mouthfeel ! ! not too much carbonation , and has considerable astringency from alcohol , but the tremendous oiliness totally blankets the mouth , and gives every single tastebud a sampling of the wonderful taste . a little rough to drink because of the high abv . although due to the exceptional taste , i had no problem drinking the entire 8.5 oz . bottle . twelve oz . might be too much . i will drink this beer again and again , but maybe only once a month ."

S"when i stopped in at bottleworks to grab a growler of action jackson both employees asked me excitedly if i 'd had it before . when they heard my `` no '' answer they gushed about how what a great ipa it is . they were n't wrong . it pours a wonderful hazy golden color . it 's the shade of gold that just hollers 'hoppy ' in an outside voice . even the head betrays itself . though its just a small cap it looks dense and creamy . i know that the body on this one is going to be thick and inviting . this time , i 'm the one who is n't wrong . mmmmm . tasty . citrusy hops take center stage while the meager malts play backup . the hops are bright and vibrant . the finish is bitter but mingled with sweetness . i think this is a highly hopped beer that might not completely offend the palate of the non-hop-head . that said , i 'd love to taste an even more unrestrained version . i dig the hell out of this.bill please brew this again ! oh yeah , there 's coffee in there too , see if you can spot it !"

S'consumed 11/27/08 . poured into a standard pint glass at 52 degrees fahrenheit . beer pours a clear medium golden . a nice head quickly forms then subsides to a thin layer of foam . not much carbonation . aromas of bubblegum and copper penny . a lightly grassy hoppy smell fades away fast after initial pour . beer is thick and sufficiently carbonated despite appearance . a bit prickly . flavors are off : copper is a major flavor component . some moderate to heavy spice ( white pepper and coriander ) and bitter orange . some alcohol heat . slight floral character as well , like honeysuckle . this was a drain pour due to the too-strong metallic flavor .'

S"ever have a piece of cake where the cake is great , but the icing is so sweet and overpowering that it ruins the cake ? of course you have , and this was precisely my reaction to pumking . appearance is a nice golden brown ale with some head , and the smell really is exceptional because it transcends a spicy pumpkin pie . in fact the smell was so impressive that i never thought that beer could be used as such a transformer to convey an aroma . however , if you 're looking to smell something that resembles 'beer ' then you 'll need to find a different beverage . but that taste , wow , it can be broken into two distinct parts . first , there is a hoppy ipa , with citrus and a dry mouthfeel . but the ipa is quickly overwhelmed by a very heavy sweet and spicey pumpkin finish . if you 'd like to drink your desert on thanksgiving then i 'd highly recommend pumking ."

S"i 've had this beer quite a few times , and it 's become one of my favorites . you definitely have to be a hop lover . but for those who are n't intimidated by hops , this is your beer . everything about this beer screams that fruit/floral aromatic hop taste . sort of like biting into a peach or apricot , but with a nice bitter bite that blends perfectly . it 's hard not to notice the pine flavor as well . aroma matches the beer well . one thing that has always stood out for me about this beer is the texture . absolutely creamy & silky . it 's hard to put into words . few beers have this type of texture . drinkability does suffer a bit from being so bitter , but this beer is for sipping . overall , as i said , one of my favorites . one worth seeking out , especially if you like i.p.as . highly recommended ."

S"from k & l in redwood city the bottle says it 's brewed with fennel and figs . a : this beer pours into my goblet and forms probably the most beautiful non-nitrous head i 've ever seen -- nice and big and creamy , brown on top , off white after a sip . s : the nose is restrained with caramel malt , a touch of chocolate , and then a little vinous alcohol halfway through the glass . t : thick chewy , the sweetness is quickly balanced by a moderate level of clean hop bitterness . the burnt flavors of a nice big stout arise from the edges . mild dark fruit ( raisin/prune ) plays a minor role , compared to a lot of ris beers out there . not really any fig . the fennel manifests as a broad licorice taste that really blends in quite well . m : big , thick , full , but ... d : the finish is syrupy and cloying . comments : this is a nice big big stout , but the finish is subpar . i 'm guessing the fig was mostly useful in providing sugar , so maybe that 's why i do n't get any fig . or peppercorn . the licorice is alright , i suppose ."

S"*edit* ( 1-29-09 ) well i reviewed this a few days ago , but i think my tastes may have been a little off , because i 'm drinking one right now and i got ta say this seems much more balanced then i initially believed and the more it warms the more sweetness and caramel flavors come through in the beer . i 'm really diggin ' this atm ! consequently i gots to bump the taste up a notch . pours just shy of mahogany in color with some definite copper tones . has a huge , rocky , cream colored head that got away from me . really good retention with a lot of pillowy suds left on the glass . aroma consists of a strong hop profile . predominately pine aromas with a floral kick . also a nice sweet toasted malt aroma hidden behind all the hoppiness . flavor is also heavy on the hop side with a lot of floral and piney character with a sort of spiciness in the background , and just a hint of sweet caramel right towards the end . has a bitter finish and a bit of booze burn as well . heavy bodied , medium carbonation . a thick creamy beer that coats your mouth with a delicious slick of yumminess ! i think this will really benefit with age though , as the hop profile really is a bit much in it 's present state . not that i do n't love hops , but i also love a well balanced barleywine ."

S"just a slight easy pour sent the head to the top of my glass . i 've seen this with alot of belgium beers . extreme head like 3 inches thick . looks like a milkshake with tons of thick thick lacing left as it slowly dissolves . i have to pour a bit then wait and pour then wait because the head is about 80 % of the glass . it 's actually over-carbonated which makes it hard to drink . has a strange aroma that 's hard to place . roasted malts with a metallic aroma maybe . extremely well-crafted to yield this much head . aroma kind of smells like tomatoes . if i can get the head to reduce i can actually taste this and finish this review . extreme carbonation reduces the quality of the mouthfeel and finish . it leaves it real fizzy like seltzer water . it expands in you mouth like foam . that will reduce the drinkability for me also . very dry bitter finish with hints of roasted malts and grains . dark amber in color . body is a bit watery from the monster head i presume . the abv is well-hidden . overall this beer is good but the carbonation is just too much ."

S"overall : this is a light drinkable beer which i can generally take or leave . i do admit , even as an avid home brewer , i enjoy taking a cold bud out of a bucket of ice once in a while on a hot summer day while slaving over the barbecue . it serves it 's purpose . it is , after all , one of the most consumed beers in the world . but that may not be saying much . appearance : i would only drink this from a bottle or keg and it pours a very pale yellow with little to no head . if it does develop a head , it disappears quickly . highly carbonated . smell : it smells like beer and i think i can pull some hops out of it . however , it has a sweet rice filler aroma . taste : very mild and refreshing . like i said , good on a hot summer day when you are very thirsty . it goes down smooth . mouth feel : heavy on the carbonation but not offensive . finishes slightly bitter . drinkability : this beer is highly drinkable and goes down easy . if your looking for a refreshing , drinkable beer , this is it . would take it over coors any day . otherwise , stick with the craft brews for fuller flavor and body . not saying that craft brews are not refreshing and drinkable , they definitely are , but just a little heavier . it also depends on the meal you wish to drink with ."

S"for review # 100 , let 's take it back to where it all began with my first beer . a - a bold traditional amberish gold hits the eyes as this american masterpiece is poured into the glass . a frothy , huge head billows its way up to the tip of the glass , a errant slip of liquid spills subtly over the side of the glass . the huge champagne-like bubbles lazily float to the top , as if they 're dancing to a leisurely tune , or taking a nice stroll to the park to meet with their bubble friends . the head slowly dissipates into a nice conglomeration of beautiful lacing , as if someone painted it there . at least , that 's what this would have looked like if someone had n't taken a normal beer and watered it down to about a 1:100 beer to water ratio . instead it 's almost clear with some tinges of yellow , huge bubbles that rise to the top and pop , and a kind of slick oily look to it . s - the triple hops brewed and strong american malts are cleverly hidden by the powerful smell of the us heartland : corn . smelling this takes me back to the cornfields of iowa , as cornhusk rolls over my knows in waves , i think back to farmers swapping stories about the weather and downing the cheapest , easiest beer they could find , often miller lite . you 've come a long way baby . t - the cool refreshing taste of water hits my tongue with the faintest , haunting taste of grainy beer entering the mouth , before disappearing forever . an excessive mouthful brings us back to the corn taste , as this wateringly refreshing brew goes down . rumors of hops , malts , and even alcohol have been heard , but apparently on the the best of the beer connoisseurs are able to find those delightfully hidden treasures in this beer . m - the large bubbles are the first hint that you 're drinking something other than water , as they explode in your mouth and remind you that unlike water , this was n't free . however like water , it 's cool , light and refreshing , making it hard to tell the difference between the two . d - so easy to drink , so quick to go down , just like water itself . just make sure to check your container occassionaly , as you may have switched them without knowing it . here 's to # 100 . happy drinking !"

S'pours a gorgeous super deep black , with a quickly diminishing small tan head that leaves no lacing . as soon as the top came off , the alcohol aroma was present , as was lots of dark fruitiness ( raisin , plum ) , some syrup , and some chocolate . flavor was overly sweet to start , slightly better in the middle when the fruit , syrup , and chocolate flavors mix and mellow a little , and then the alcohol kicks in with a tongue numbing , belly warming thump . this is probably not something i would try again , just not my style .'

S"12oz can poured into pint glass . pure white bubbly head dissapates into nothing very quickly , clear gold , no wonder they call this horse piss , though it tastes much better i imagine . does not look very inviting to drink after the head goes away ( sidebar : why did bud light have those commercials about how to pour their beer when the head disappears in a few seconds anyways , just asking ) and just sits there . not much taste , water and bubbles followed by corn and the tiny hint of malts aftertaste is minimal so the first sip is the same as the last , boring , boring beer . if you are out to get drunk this is n't the best beer because the abv is so low , better off with an ice beer , but if you 're tossing a few back at a cookout on a hot day this might be nice , but i 'd say go with blue moon if you have to go macro ."

S"brewed with 2-row , caramel , chocolate , biscuit , and wheat malts . hopped with cascade , willamette , and northern brewer . 5.5 % abv . pours out to a sparkingly clear deep mahogany with chestnut accents , forming a modest dark-beige head with average retention and very nice lacing . carbonation is medium . aroma is actually enticing , something i 've not come to expect from this brewery ... sweet amber malts predominate , a modest amount of likeable diacetyl ( which i normally abhor ) , some mild earthen hops , vanila extract , and faint milk chocolate . mouthfeel is initially wet , but quickly becomes ruddy and oxidized with a dry finish and medium body . taste begins nice enough with very herbal hops , but quickly becomes overpowered by fusel alcohols , nasty buttery diacetyl , and the taste of dank musty cardboard . finish is woody and leathery like a sofa from the 70 's . aluminum vats and caustic cleaners linger in the aftertaste . this is my least favorite style , but truly ... .this is acrid , horrible stuff . this qualifies as `` down-the-sink '' material . stay away ."

S'the second angel to fall pours totally opaque black with a nice size tan head . smell is very maltalicious but has a nice hop presence . some dark fruit ( cherry maybe ) and alcohol . the burnt coffee flavors are noticeable first in the taste , followed by malt and a fairly fierce dosage of hoppiness . at first this seems smooth , but then the alcohol absolutely begins to rape and pillage the palate . dont get me wrong , for 16 % this is drinkable . alcohol taste along with the remains of the coffee flavors and some bitter bitter chocolate and hops on the finish . mouthfeel is the jewel of this one imo . almost perfect , nice and viscous . drinkability is ok for the abv , but you will feel the alcohol in this one . i think this would benefit from a year or 5 in the cellar . i will defenitely be stashing some . a wonderful brew , but defenitely needs some cellar time as this mofo is hot as ... well ... hell !'

S"i 've been buying this beer for a few months now , as my `` budget '' beer . it 's priced lower than the mass-produced stuff , and it 's a superior product , as far as my palate is concerned . when i saw that it did n't even have 5 reviews yet , i had to jump in . bear with me , as this is my first ba review ... the beer pours a nice amber-copper colour , with an off-white head that looks like it might stick around , but disappears after about a minute . no amount of swirling would bring it back , despite the level of carbonation in the beer . the aroma is just on the interesting side of nondescript ; a wee bit of caramel , a wee bit of vanilla wafer , a wee bit of hops . the flavour is better ; faint caramel malt , a `` hint-o-pine '' which makes this beer lean a bit towards the ipa side of the pale ale spectrum , and bitter enough to remind you that you 're not drinking a molson product . the carbonation is about average as pale ales go , and the mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side , but not bad . i 'll buy it until the price goes up !"

'' i had n't and she put it in the cart . what 's interesting is that she reads everything and knows if a beer is over 5 % abv , its abv has to be on the label . no way she would have handed me a bottle of 20 % beer . the abv is not on the label of the bottle . appearance clear , dark copper to mahogany collar , minimal head which disappears instantly . i observed neither legs nor belg1an . aroma : wow - the malt and the fruit are overwhelming . my child bride took a with and reported both malt and raisins . flavor : a very stong , very intense , complex flavor with the taste of the carmel malt becoming through and well-balanced with the fruitiness . but this is a sipping beer . if you take a mouthful , you will find it harsh to your tongue as well as your throat . it is also cloyingly sweet . mouthfeel : it has a low end of thick body - very nice for those of us who ches our beer . it mush fuller than what i would expect fron a belgian strong and leads me to believe this is either an american strong or an american barlywine . i am writing this while sipping the beer and just get a significant harshness on my tongue after a small sip ! . drinlability : i 'll go for once a year . it 's a good beer , but it 's definitely not a session beer . the strength of its taste and it 's harshness are more overpowering than its alcohol content ."

S"miller lite is not a good beer . it is , however , a cheap and extremely available beer . compared with some of its peers , miller lite holds up alright . there 's not much to it : just a light malt/corn flavor on top of carbonated water with the faintest hint of hops . it lacks the unpleasant sweetness i find its budweiser counterpart , and it 's also largely devoid of the general foulness found in some other competitors . as anyone who frequents crappy bars with 3 dollar pitcher nights can tell you , this beer is very drinkable . i think that miller lite functions quite well as a quick , cold beer to grab on the way home from work , but it is not delicious ."

S'what exactly is the significance of someone who bites pillars ? anyway , the beer pours with a hazy , orangish straw color . it is well carbonated and topped by an initially three-finger thick , pale almost white colored head . the aroma is quite funky and spicy ; it smells a bit of moldy , funky cheese and also of earthy spices , damp earth , and perhaps a hint of phenolic plastic . lots of different phenolic aromatics are here though . well carbonated , the beer foams up as it first hits my tongue . it is fairly dry as well and finishes with a light tartness . despite this , it has a medium fullness to the palate . as the beer loses carbonation it picks up a hint of sweetness , but it remains quite an austere beer overall . the beer has a spicy character that is a mix of white pepper , ginger , lemon peel , and an earthy note sort of like coriander , but much more geared towards damp earth . that funky cheese note is here in the flavor as well , it is not quite that prominent , but is certainly quite noticeable . there is some lightly noticeable fruit notes here as well , with notes of pear and apple being most noticeable . this beer is just not that great , the cheesy note certainly does not help , but even without that there is not enough here to really hold my interest .'

S"dark almost black/murky brown , looks a lot like coffee actually . tried hard to produce a head but my efforts were useless , just a thin skim on the surface . slight hint of fruit in the aroma other than that i ca n't detect anything else . very low carbonation and the mouthfeel is actually not what i was expecting , kinda thin for strong dark 10.5 % belgian ale . somewhat fuity-spicy aftertaste , got ta say that the 10.5 % is very well hidden . should have left this in the cellar for awhile to age/condition a little bit , i thinking that the bottle i got could have benefited from some aging ."

S"pours a deep red-brown with no head and no lacing . scent is ok with raspberry initially coverd with brown sugar carmelized raisins and bread pudding . it all comes together to form a scent alongside the alcohol . taste is huge and bready with a red raspberry center then alcohol then raspberry again to finish it all off , but the alcohol is hidden in there somewhere . the carmel flavor holds on for quite a while . at 13.5 the alcohol really does n't stand out all that much . mouthfeel is a bit thinner than i would expect from the taste and the smell , smooth but still on the medium side . the carbination seemed just about right . drinkability is easy to define , good . i am somewhat impressed with the hiding of the alcohol . note : this beer was 12.59 for 6.3 oz . i liked it ok , but at that price sadly , i wo n't be having another ."

S"big woosh when the cap is pried off leads to one of the biggest heads i 've seen on a beer in a long time . poured into a mug , foam fills almost 2/3 of the glass . this is a ton of fun watching it settle . all kinds of lacing on the side of the glass , and the head settles eventually to what looks like a fluffy marshmallow atop the pale straw liquid . the beer is pretty clear and there are still bubbles coming up from the bottom of the mug . both the aroma and taste are very clean and awfully reminiscent of a lager . i know this is technically an ale , but i 'm not sure that i 'd be able to pick it out a kolsch/pils lineup . you get that pilsner-like bite at the end but otherwise it 's very balanced . although abv is unknown , i 'd be shocked if it was north of 5.5 % , so it 's exceedingly quaffable . i ca n't get over how carbonated it is - my glass nearly overflowed on every pour throughout the bottle - so that makes it a good choice on a hot day . i 'm not sure that `` single malt '' does for beer what it does for scotch , but this one 's a winner ."

S'12 oz bottle poured into a 10oz cantillon glass - born in 2007 - served at cellar temp . appearance : the cap open swith a loud swich and the pour soon yields a transparent , copper and golden colored beer . the head rises to 1.5 inches and is an off-white color . it is thick and cakey , with deep craters and a soapy look . retention is superb , this head does not want to let go . it takes at least five minutes to settle . smell : a blast of pine is the foremost aroma , followed by some grapefruit , with orange and lemon peel . taste : this is a very piney ipa . it starts off nice and bitter with some underlying grapefruit acidity . i find it to be very flat in both mouthfeel and complexity though . mouthfeel : flat and surprisingly disappointing . the aroma and appearance of this beer was promising . slight carbonation hits the tongue at first and then the beer mellows for the swallow . it is thinly bodied and is quite bitter . alcohol makes a slight presence . not bad but not good . drinkability : good . this ale is a good choice for pine fans , but i am more of a grapefruit guy . the flat body is a disappointment .'

S"2007 vintage . pours a murky golden orange with the slightest amount of an off white head that dissolves quickly into a thin ring around the glass . the smell is great- a mixture of sweetnesses that include caramel , toffee , brown sugar , apricot , figs , and even some citrusy orange . no trace of hops left in the aroma after 3 years . wow . this is a really good beer that i quite difficult to figure out . like the smell , the flavor is basically a mixture of miscellaneous sweetnesses , not all of which i can put my finger on . all of those mentioned above are present , with an emphasis on the brown sugar . the first sip is very hot with the 11.5 % abv , but it calms down after the palate is subdued by the sugars . the mouthfeel is a near perfect blend of carbonation and a full body , though it 's a little thinner than i would like it to be . the drinkability is limited by the abv and the overall sweetness . this one would probably be better fresh , with a little hoppiness to complement the sugars ."

S"poured from 22 oz bottle into nonic pint glass . a - hazy golden with nice 2-3 finger head . decent retention , falling to a white cap . great lacing . s - faint . moderately strong buttery note with something vague that could be hops , juniper , or both . t - more bland than i would expect . thin malt profile dominates with some graininess , followed by the buttery flavor mid palate . taste finishes up with some very faint juniper and some very mild citrus hops . quite bitter aftertaste considering the general lack of flavor . m - thin and low carbonation , borderline watery . this stuff needs body and co2 to carry the flavor and provide crispness . d - i would n't mind having a few of these mindlessly if not for the price . it 's a slightly interesting take on a pale ale and the low carbonation coupled with the thinness would be perfect if i was already drunk . when i saw `` juniper '' i suppose i was expecting something akin to gin . i know this brew is vastly different than something like gin , but even still i was n't impressed by the juniper , and i was n't impressed by this `` pale ale .

S"pours a brilliantly clear yellow with a fluffly small head . aromas of citrus , slight coriander and sweet/grainy wheat malt . taste : hint of orange , with a coriander punch and very slight hop flavor , which is earthy and musty . aftertaste is nonexistent . mouthfeel : thin , medium carbonation , off-putting . drinkability : that is one of the few things this beer has going for it . overall , a shadow of a witbier . the orange and coriander do stand out , but only for a moment , and the rest of the beer fails to back it up with characteristic witbier complexity . the finish is just ... .bland . i like nb 's lineup for the most part , but this is definitely the least of their beers i have tried ."

S"pours a beautiful hazy light orange with a frothy white head that leaves droopy horizontal strips of lacing down the sides . smell leaves a lot to be desired . primarily yeasty , but subdued , the most prominent `` hefeweizen '' smell is that of clove . maybe a bit of banana as well . somewhat soapy . taste is similarly underwhelming . very light on flavor , with clove again being the most noticeable yeast characteristic . lightly sweet at first , in a manner reminiscent of tangerines , the flavor eventually dries out a bit . again , a somewhat off flavor is present . almost soapy . the mouthfeel is right on . light bodied and very clean . effervescent carbonation that might be a touch too high . overall , a very easy drinking but uninteresting hefeweizen . though it 's been a while since i drank one , this reminds me quite a bit of widmer 's hef ."

S'free on tap at grants farm . pour was deep murky copper with a slight orange hue . nice fluffy white head smell wasnt too bad , there was a bit of wheat with a touch of citrus , mainly lime . very slight wheat up front with an artificial lime funk that made its artificial self known . it was overpowering in that it ruined the beer . there was not much of a wheat presence here at all , it was light and slightly bitter . carbonation was actually pretty decent and it had a nice body . i had two glasses , the first was just terrible . i figured maybe they had bud light light lime running through this line first and they didnt clean it . i stopped drinking that glass and went for another from the other tap . it was not as bad but there was still a fake lime flavor . i know the kewl thing with that crowd is a lemon slice in the glass so i am curious if ab ( piss off inbev ) added this citrus flavor to compensate for it . terrible decision .'

S"got this bottle from pizza peel in charlotte nc . it pours a dark amber brown hued body . it has a thick , froathy cream colored head . nice steady carbonation throughout the consumption . smells of sweet maltiness underlying a mild tartness that is n't quite sour . little herbal notes and spicey finish . taste sweet and tart and malty . there 's a mix of caramel and smooth tart apple notes . there 's a tart finish without much of a hop pressence . spices comthrough with cumin and bitter orange . mouthfeel is thicker than expected but very smooth . drinkability is easy and like many belgians ."

S"poured from 22oz bottle into a snifter , the black bear xx is pitch black with a 1 finger dark tan creamy head that leaves thick bubbly lace and a hefty collar . the aroma is pretty subdued , molasses and rye . it opens up and sweetens as it warms , reminiscent of sweet cream , but not appetizing to me for a stout . it also got a bit boozy towards the end , but again , sweet . the taste is really not my cup of tea , maybe it 's the rye , or the anise flavor that i ca n't ignore ( and never like ) , but i will try to remain objective . it 's fairly complex , and also includes the appropriate roastiness , with sweet milk , caramel , and some citrus flavoring hops as well as bittering on the finish . i 'm not sure if it 's the rye or what , but there is a sweet flavor that strikes me as a bit off , although this bottle is not that old , and has been well kept locally . i have another in the stash and i 'll have to see if it smooths out with age or amplifies unfavorably . the mouthfeel is pretty nice , matching the appearance as strong suits . it is not to heavy and really creamy and frothy in your mouth . i did n't really care for the taste of this one , and by the end of the 2nd snifter from the bottle , i was pretty sick of it . it was n't that heavy though though so if it 's your thing , it 's probably pretty drinkable . just a bit to sweet for me . i 'm compelled to try this on nitro at the brewery now that i live here , although i ca n't say i 'm in a big hurry to do so . hopefully it 'll be more enjoyable and i 'll re-review . same goes for the bottle i 'm cellaring ."

S"a - pours a hazy golden color with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly . seems to be some sediment floating in there as is typical with the style . s - spice and yeast with plenty of alcohol . perhaps pear/apple scents . t - spicy and fruity , but the alcohol is not masked very well , something common with many attempts at this style . i 'm getting some orange and coriander . finishes spicy . m - medium body , not overly carbonated . goes down smooth and is n't as sticky as others i have had . d - my bottle says that this is 9.7 % . perhaps they have tweaked the recipe ? i would think the ba beer profile needs to be updated . this is a very strong beer and makes for a tasty treat but is by no means a session ale . overall a decent tripel , but i am by no means a connoisseur of this style . i enjoy a triple once in a while and at 5.99 for the 22 oz bottle this was a tasty treat ! opt for golden monkey if you can ."

S"had on tap the the frankfurt international airport . oh what a joy it is arriving in a land where you can get something better than canadian or coors on tap at your local aiport ! just had a nice pint poured for me , presenting it 's big , luscious , creamy white head for all to see . the beer itself is a hazy amber in color , with light orange light seeping through , classic weiss , with nice head retention and a fairly aggressive visible carbonation . the nose of the beer is packed with banana , similar to a hacker pschorr yet less sickly sweet and more balanced by nice assertive notes of black pepper and clove . the taste backs up the banana bomb nose , adding more spicy , peppery notes of clove , coriander and a doughy rye characteristic coming through on the finish . for an airport beer , i really ca n't complain , the drinkability is ( and will be ) very easy from here in !"

S"i bought a bomber of scuttlebutt homeport blonde ale at a grocery store to taste and review . poured in to a pint glass . pours a rich gold color and is slightly hazy . a fizzy white head forms and is gone in a flash , leaving a brew that looks like apple cider . the smell is floral with a distinct yeast presence . the taste is pretty good , a biscuit flavor up front with a little fruity tang , and then a mild bitter finish . mouthfeel is good , crisp and clean , moderately carbonated . very drinkable . not a real remarkable beer , certainly drinkable . nice flavor , good crisp body and low abv make it a nice sessionable beer , especially on a summer day . i would n't go out of my way form homeport blonde , but i would n't turn it down either ."

S"beer review 1000 . i guess this is an appropriate beer to review for that honor . for baltimore beer week , casey at max 's opened up a few bottles of 10 year old ( 1999 vintage ) bottles of wws . i went ahead and got a 5 ounce pour , which was absolutely plenty . the beer pours a blackish brown color with minimal head retention and lacing . the beer has very little carbonation left at this point , though it was n't quite still either . on the nose this aroma profile is flat out ravishing . there is a considerable booziness to this beer on the nose and palate , but there is also a boatload of chocolate and coffee , with hints of licorice and cherry . flavors on the palate replicate the nose , except this beer is almost port like . at 10 years of age this beer is an absolute stunner , and is very , very sweet with flavors of cherry , chocolate , golden raisins and liquer . to no great surprise , this beer is mouth coating and is very , very long on the finish . while delicious , the combination of extremely high alcohol and sweetness make it something of a chore to down even a 5 ounce pour . even though the beer was absolutely delicious , it still took the better part of a half hour to get through my 5 ounce pour . very impressed by how well this beer has held up . well done dogfish head ."

S"10 oz draft pour in a tulip glass . this beer arrived a light clear yellow with about 2 fingers of foam that left extensive lacing . aroma was mostly hops , but not the typicall grapefruit/citrus hops in most american pale ales and ipas . this was a subtler , more floral hop . taste was not quite as good as i remember it being when i had it in a bottle . this is quite possibly due to the fact that when i have a bottled wheat , i 'm one of those that swirls the last half ounce in the bottle before pouring , in order to grab some of the sediment along with the beer . i 'm not positive this is a wheat beer ( it certainly tastes that way to me ) , but i distinctly remembering swirling the sediment into the glass when i had the big bottle of this last august . i felt the taste improved after i did that . in this daft version , i tasted the hops and the wheat quite clearly , but it comes through harsh and unforgiving , with no smoothness or yeasty characteristics to mellow it out . this may be one of the very few beers i prefer in a bottle to draft ."

S'bought this beer due to curiosity of my lovely girlfriend ( she brews beer too ) and we didnt know what expect , lambic ? framboise ? it has a nice color , good carbonation , and one hella banana taste ! good toasted/nutty balance to cut through the banana flavor , its a woodsy banana beer without all the sweetness of a lambic . wouldnt necessarily buy it again but its better than some beer !'

S'this beer is an example of affordable goodness . i bought a six pack on special for under $ 5 in atlanta . there are very few , if any , six packs that can equal its value at this price . i first had this beer in disneyworld in 2005 . it was served in epcot at the germany district to an eager dad with two kids . i have fond memories of my youngsters running around disney with a fine optimator in my hand . i quickly returned for a second outrageously expensive pint . perhaps these memories biased my opinion , but drinking this beer takes me back to the summer our family spent in disney . anyway , the only criticism that i have for this beer is the long and syrupy aftertaste . it has a nice feel in the mouth and the 7 % is perfect for its flavor .'

S'damn fine looking beer- translucent brown with rusty orange highlights and a kick-ass tan head . aroma is more gentle than one would expect . roast malt leads the way but ther are some black bread and raisins in there as well . swirling brings out a breath of fresh spicy hops . the palate is a straightforward blend of the dark bready character , roasty malt , the raisins and a touch of caramel . bitterness is clean , quenching and more than adequate . a fine brew that gets better with each successive glass .'

S"pours clear , light yellow , with a white moderate head that falls quickly to a whisp . aromatics are promising with a big burst of blueberries , albiet on the sweet and artificial side of things . clean yeast and no malt , hops or any other qualities apparent in the nose . medium bodied and medium carbonation , slightly syrupy . the beer falls out of favor on the pallet , sickly sweet and overly bitter at the same time . blueberry flavor is moderate and unbalanced by any other character . no malt , hops , or fermentation character to help out , leaving just a sweet , fake blueberry essence . finishes sweet and bitter with a slight harshness and some sort of `` offness '' ."

S"the new 2009 vintage served into a snifter glass . a very nice looking ale in the glass - clear light red color with a dense cream colored head on top . a very pungent , raw hop aroma comes off of this . grass , pine , lemon , toast and caramel are all in the nose . the flavor starts out fruity with hints of orange and sugary dried fruits . after the initial fruity sweetness , a firm , citrusy bitterness grabs ahold . some toast and maybe a bit of light roast try to budge in toward the finish , but they are squashed down pretty quickly by the crushing bitterness . a sticky citrus bitterness remains in the aftertaste and really does n't go anywhere between sips . feel in the mouth is thick with a moderate carbonation . i feel like the fresher this beer is , the harder it is to drink , not to say that i do n't like it , just from a drinkability standpoint . the bigfoot is an increadibly complex and intriguing ale . while the hop aromas are very nice fresh , i think that the bitterness is a little too raw and brash . it is alot better drinking around 6-12 months in my opinion . the rest of the sixer will be resting in the cellar for a while ."

S"i was so excited to find this beer due to its great reviews and of course its name . i was able to get ahold of a bottle in a gas station in south dakota , of all places . it was a new shipment , so i assume it was fresh . this beer pours a pitch black color with a towering brownish-white head . it takes a while to settle down , but looks fabulous in my glass . i waited about 15 minutes so it could warm up a bit . the aromas were outstanding with a strong coffee note initially . this is followed by a solid chocolate aroma and some mild smokiness . not a hop to be found , but this is a good thing in this brew . unfortunately the taste did not follow the aroma entirely . all i could get initially was coffee . do n't get me wrong , this was n't sanka , but it was just too much . the coffee flavor was pleasurable , but it was just unbalanced to me . i only had a mild hint of the other malts with some slight smokiness and a mild aftertaste of chocolate . otherwise the flavor was like drinking a cool glass of espresso . i even waited another 15 minutes to let it warm up more . still no major flavor profiles other than the coffee . the flavor was a let down but the mouthfeel was nice and silkly smooth . overall this beer really disappointed me . it was n't a drain pour by any means , but it was n't a rock star like proclaimed . it was just too unbalanced , even for a coffee stout . i love coffee and i love beer . i 've had other coffee stouts and porters that were excellent . unfortunately this was not one of them . it may be good for breakfast , just due to the fact that it is like drinking a coffee . i 'd rather have the warm cup of joe before i go to work . plus the cost of the coffee is only a fraction of what i paid for this ."

S"on draft at the trappist in oakland . from memory ( hell , it was just a few hours ago ) . a : pours a pitch black body capped with a dark mocha head . short retention , no lace ; the collar is small , but there is a nice dark swirl on top of the beer . s : this is surprisingly spicy . i kept quiet to see if t0rin0 and womencantsail would pick it up without prompting ; they did . smoky as well . this reminds me of my recent observation in dark horizon no . 3 : i 'm guessing the coffee is the culprit behind the smoked-chili effect in the nose . rum is noticeable . dark chocolate and molasses . a nice nose to be sure . t : lots of coffee and roast . the spice effect is found here too ; we speculated that it might be a spiced rum , but maybe it 's the burning effect you get from consuming pure sugar . either way , the beer is not cloying . it is in fact more on the bitter side , with a dominant roast and slightly astringent finish . i pick up some vanilla as well . while it was n't awful , i did n't care for it . m : full-bodied in flavor . it 's pretty viscous , though not sludgy . i was surprised to see that this was 13 % ; it 's not particularly boozy , though there is a light warmth . smooth and comforting . d : despite the nose and mouthfeel , the beer did n't taste all that great , and i left a good portion of the 25cl glass on the table . i 've never been impressed with struise and this has n't changed my feelings ."

S"well something mysterious about this beer in its appearance . as a brown ale it looks fantastic . a dark chocolate colored or even fudgy in appearance . a distinct creamy mocha head settles quickly into a light mist within seconds after pouring . carbonation levels are obviously high as the snifter is swirled . chocolate in color and chocolate in aromas . semiweet chocolate actually . some dark fruits leaning toward plums and dates with a rum soaked raisiny edge . than the wood sneaks in . somewhat of a rustic scent with earthy undertones . and things mellow out in a thick brown sugar , and roasted malty aroma . this is a good beer . a damn good beer in fact . mouth coating with maybe the longest finish i 've had in a brew . it just sticks with you and stays and stays and stays and ... well you get the picture . very rich and creamy . tastes nearly like it smells with very litte in way of the wood used . not sure how much of the wood could really infuse the beer anyway being a 10,000 gallon barrel . gooey brown sugar with rummy raisins , roasted almost burnt malts , date , black fig , plums and nutty berry like middle . a damn good beer however this one is so big and rich it could take quite awhile to drink one let alone more . with age in the bottle i see that changing ."

S"appearance - deep amber in color , and clear . no head at all , and no visible carbonation . smell - sweet malt dominates the smell of this beer . i can pick up little , if any , hops . it is appealing , and indicates that this should be a thick beer worth savoring . taste - there is mostly malty sweetness in this beer . time has taken away a lot of the bitterness , except in the aftertaste . the taste is sort of plain for a barley wine . flavor improves as the beer warms . mouthfeel - flat . the body is okay , except for the utter lack of carbonation , which ruins the beer . drinkability - not really that good . the beer seems lifeless , or maybe like some magical quality within it can not burst forth . either way , it is disappointing . i know barley wines are not supposed to be highly carbonated , but should n't they have some carbonation ? comments - the substance of my conversation with the waitress : me : `` this beer is really flat . '' waitress : `` it 's supposed to be . '' me : `` completely flat ? '' waitress : `` our brewer says it is supposed to be best at about 2 1/2 to 3 years . do you want to talk to him ?

S"appearance : pours a ridiculously dark black ; even the pour is black and opaque . possibly the darkest beer i 've ever seen . not much carbonation here , and the head suffers a bit for it , receding to a ring quickly and leaving no lace . smell : loaded with dark chocolate goodness , molasses , charred grains and a hint of dark fruit . taste & mouthfeel : dark chocolate , like a 100 % cacao chocolate bar ; as the name implies , there is n't much sweetness here . instead , it 's all about the charred grain , cacao and burnt whole grain bread . the body is medium-full , not quite as full as i was hoping for an imperial oatmeal stout however . there 's some heat in the finish , more than i was expecting from a beer of 9 % , along with a slightly acrid bitterness . hopefully this mellows in time , because with a bit more smoothness this would be a great beer ."

S'although it is rare that i intentionally set out and buy an adjuct lager such a corona , this is one i actually do get get quite a bit especially in the summer time . the frequency of my purchase habits however , should not be seen as an indication of my impression of this beer . a very pale , very clear , very watered down appearance and faint smell surrounds corona . one might easily mistake it as a light beer based upon its appearance and indeed the mouthfell is very light and watery . it begs the question why make a light version of this beer is the extra is so light in and of itself . be that at is may , corona does have a nice crisp taste to it that hits the spot on a summer day . rather easy to drink despite it short comings and one i will continue to buy spring thru labor day . all in all , nothing terrific , but a nice beer to relax with every so often during the summer .'

S'ah red stripe . a typical adjunct lager in a distinctive bottle . pours bright yellow with a crisp white head . tastes just like any other lager . refreshing on a hot day , easy to drink - no problem man . back in the 1980s ( in the uk ) there was a variant of red stripe called crucial brew . it was a knock off of carlsberg special brew . the crucial brew came in black cans with a red stripe on it and was a high alcohol lager - probably verging on being a malt liquor .'

S"thanks to exbeastiefan2k for allowing me to knock this style off the list . poured a 16oz tallboy into my tripel karmeliet tulip . this beer pours a dark cola brown with a sizable , fish eyed white head and pretty active carbonation . wow , the aroma is like a smack in the face . rye and molasses . straight up . it 's actually really odd , but not necessarily in a bad way . the taste on the other hand is in a bad way . while i have no experience with the style and do n't know if its supposed to taste like , i ca n't imagine want to drink this again . the flavor is like a cloying sweet cola without the sugar . instead substitute the sugar for sorghum molasses and saccharine . there is a definite herbal/medicinal quality to the beer too . the mouthfeel is like a light soda but has a sacchariney sweet mouth feel . like i said earlier , i do n't think i will be searching out another kvass ."

S"interesting beer here . southern tier does a lot of quality stuff , but their high prices tend to dissuade me a bit . this brew pours decent amber with a decent head , albeit with little lacing . nose is both grapefruity and malty , albeit more on the former than the latter . in terms of flavour , this has to be one of the easier drinking 11 % , dipa type of beers that i 've had , albeit in a relative sense . the beer has a very strong citrus/grapefruit background , but it 's exceptionally balanced and the high abv is not at all abrasive for my palate , unlike many of the recent dipa offerings . mouthfeel relatively thick albeit not syrupy . drinkability is the big winner : a very drinkable beer for being so huge , if you can afford it . the bottom line : if you 're acclimated to hops and you want something that is pretty well-balanced for the style , then unearthly is a a good pick-up . i do n't think it breaks any real ground in the style , and it 's probably not big enough for the hop heads , but for someone like myself , who appreciates big hop beers but tends to like malt bombs more , it 's a nice change of pace ."

S"333 ml bottle . 1999 vintage . served mulled , december 2004 . pours a deep , wine-like burgundy with no carbonation or head . strong clove and spice aromas over sweet wine and cherries . flavors start with tart cherries , develop into port-like sweet wine , and finish with plenty of cloves , spice , and woody cherry-pit sourness . smooth medium wine-like body with no carbonation . much closer to a spiced port than a beer at this age . very tasty on a cold winter night ( assuming you know what you 're getting into ) ."

S"the picture on the profile does it no justice , it 's got a nice drawing of a jolly bald bearded flannel-wearing man carrying a barrel . poured into a guinness tulip pint pours black with ruby highlights when held to light with a big , but quickly receding head . note decent lacing . the smell is big crystal malt , dark figs or prunes , some chocolate . good earthy bittering hops in there balancing the sweetness . the body is thinner than expected , however , does n't hurt enjoyability . it 's good to see someone making decent beer in central europe that has n't been bought by carlsberg or heineken ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . edit : no freshness dating noted , label looks outdated after visiting brewery 's website ."

S"i did n't know what i was buying at the time , i just saw an ipa that i have n't had before so i picked it up , at $ 10.99 a bomber , this better be good . well , it is cloudy and light yellow to faint copper , with barely any head or lacing . the smell was n't what i expected out of an ipa , it smells of hops , and yeast . the taste is bitter , tasting more like an esb than a ipa . the beer is nearly flat , barely any carbonation . something is n't right with this beer , maybe it is passed it 's prime . not my kind of ipa ."

'' poured into a 12 ounce snifter at a price of $ 7.00 . great initial flavor but became sweeter and sweeter as i continued drinking . i could only drink one of these in a sitting . decent abv at 10 % and great smell and apperance . # # update 11-14-09 : aquired a bottle at the local store and ofcourse its a lot better on tap . bottle gets a b- overall ."

S'this beer is worthless when it comes to flavor . it will eat your tongue down to nothing with its harsh bubbles and carbonation . however , it is a very easy beer to drink since it has no taste and drinks like carbonated water . if you must drink a beer like this drink bud select since it is slightly better than bud light and friends .'

S'12 ounce bottle poured into a duvel tulip glass . translucent , golden , and fizzy with at least an inch of head . smell is fruity : a combination of apple juice and peach juice . some light spices can be picked up as well . flavor is mostly apple juice , mixed with slight booziness and white grape juice . not much of the spiciness that you can pick up on some other instances of the style . finishes on the bitter side . drinkability is excellent for 9 % abv . perfect mouthfeel for the style , fizzy like a glass of champagne ( which the bottle admits this beer is trying to emulate ) . this is pretty decent , but not quite as good as some of the trappist instances of the style .'

S'pours light golden with a good head which remains for a significant time , there is also some nice lacing , it looks excellent . aroma is lemony , grassy and malty , with very limited hops , i liked it . i can not say the same about taste - at first it was sour/sweet apples enhanced by prickly carbonation , with alcohol showing through and limited bitterness at the end . aftertaste is slightly dry with some sweetness . the beer only looks and smells good , the taste is rather bad ... i guess i would not drink this one again .'

S"picked up a bomber at the brewery this afternoon for $ 5.99 . code 102910 0986 on the bottle . served cold in a chilled tulip . popping the cap releases a huge hiss of escaping carbo . a moderate pour into the center of the glass gives a big 3 '' of light tan foam that has a slight orange hue . the brew itself is a clear dark cherry red when held to a light . the head has great endurance and leaves thick rings and globs of creamy lace on the glass . smell leads with a big bite of generic bittering hop that has some pine and citrus rind exuding from underneath . as it warms the hop evens out a bit , which allows some cotton candy , berries , and a little alcohol spice to become known . the taste has a strong bitter hop bite intertwined with peppery alcohol , followed by cherry taffy and a little caramel maltiness . the feel has some resiny slickness but is otherwise pretty light , goes down quick and smooth . the carbonation is perfect , in that it is entirely sufficient and not intrusive . it finishes dry on the tongue with some generic hop , pepper , and candy lingering in the back of the mouth . this drinks very easily ; it 's a big beer but it avoids being heavy or filling . gone before i knew it . at 7.9 % it 's on the small end of `` imperial '' , but i 'm glad they did n't go any further with the abv . it has a bit of peppery bite but it is n't offensive . it sits just barely on the right side of the line between `` enough '' and `` too much '' . a good brew , it is well crafted , especially considering that this style is so easily and often mediocre . highly recommended ."

S"being of fan of bocks , i was fully prepared to love this ubiquitous doppelbock . i bought a four-pack a week or so before christmas ; my kids had great fun hanging the little plastic rams on our tree . you know , i 'm not sure if i just got a couple of bad bottles or if this style is just not for me , but the first bottle out , i quite liked . it was kind of sweet and malty , smelled great , felt nice going down -- quite satisfying . then the next bottle was entirely disappointing . there was a slightly funky smell to it , and an even funkier taste . bottle # 3 was the same . i could n't bring myself to even open bottle # 4 . did i finally experience skunked beer ? i thought that was more common in highly hopped beers . at $ 10 for the four pack , i hate to try it again for fear of wasting my hard-earned beer money ."

S"my all time favorite `` sessionable '' pumpkin ale . i generally divide these beers into two categories , dessert imperials and the more drinkable versions like this . a - pours light brown in color with a thick two finger light brown head that lingers . s - smells of pumpkin predominantly , but also of cinnamon , nutmeg , and sugary malt . smells more like pumpkin pie than many others of this style i have had . t - pumpkin flavors follow the onslaught of spiciness from the first sip . a bit boozy in the aftertaste , especially as it warms . nicely balanced and full of flavor . m - this has a silky smooth feel and is medium bodied . not overly carbonated , just right for me . d - i consider this a real treat and usually have only one in a night to get myself started . flavorful and to be savored , not drank in quantity . this is a very good pumpkin ale and imo one of the best out there . spend the 8.99 and enjoy four of these on four separate nights . you 'll come to enjoy it more each night ."

S"straight of the bat - big thanks to tim and the guys at international beer shop in perth australia for throwing this one into a mixed carton as a recommendation . these guys are the best and australia ( being so far away from the action in the northern hemisphere ) is lucky to have them . chilled 375ml bottle to be enjoyed with a full sized tulip glass . silver foil wrap around the bottle top hides a caged cork bottle top ( is this the same bottle and cork set up used by bellevue for their kreik , hmmm ) . really had to force the synthetic cork out of the bottle and it gave a soft pop when it finally left the confines of the bottle . pours a very very deep black body that gives up very little when held to the light . interestingly i get absolutely no head ! there is a patch of bubble that takes up approx . a third of the surface space . this dissipates to a thin tan collar ; no lacing . aroma is full , strong and thick - a real treat . the roasted malt strikes a very definitive presence . espresso coffee is there however not as striking as other that i have tasted . dark chocolate and alcohol esters round out the aromatic spectrum . taste is well matched to the aroma however the malts take on a much more burnt dynamic . this taste for me really dominated the flavor palate , strong sweet and sticky up front , burnt malt and then a smokey finish . in fact it is the finish that i feel defines this beer from mikkeller , the tastes just continue to evolve long after the fluid leaves the mouth . the roasted and nutty dark chocolate notes sit boldly as a successor to the fine sticky and burnt malt that you taste upfront . obviously the body of this beer sits towards the heavy end of the scale and the carbonation is just enough to keep the thing lively . i should however say that the finish definitely deviates away from the usual stout finish . this is an imperial stout with a classy difference and trust mikkeller to deliver it . of course this is n't for everyone and even those that love this category may be turned off by the over active flavors and also the finish . i think that if you are yet to throw yourself into imperial stout or just something different and over the top - give this a go ."

S"class of 2004 12oz bottle - this was my first one in three years but also the first one i had allowed to age for 12+ months . has a very appealing orange/copper color with an off-white head that quickly dissipated . lots going on with the smell ... fruits , malt , alcohol ( but not so much as to clue one in to the power of this brew ) . it was sweeter and smoother than i had remembered it . good fruit balance to help distract from the potential onslaught of alcohol and hops taste , but still not a personal favorite in this aspect . mouthfeel was lighter than expected but still left a bit of a coating ... not very satisfying . very clean finish and lack of bitterness made for a high probability of multiple visitations in a single session . do this at your own risk as that 11.8 % abv will make it presence known soon enough . i might want to pour my next one more aggresively to wake things up a bit . quite drinkable for the high abv . i 'll let a couple age for another 3 months and then give it another spin ."

S"ahh , scaldis prestige . one of the more expensive beers available . usually goes from $ 40+ for a 750ml bottle , which is why i have n't had till until recently . a most generous friend brought one to a tasting ; sparing my wallet . is it worth the exorbitant price ? read on , traveler . unceremoniously dumped into a goblet , the liquid gold foams up a puny 1 centimeter tall head that fights for life atop the hazy , thick looking brew . keep in mind this is 13 % , so i 'm not sure what i was expecting ... overall it looks a little rough round the edges , but closing your eyes fixes everything . smell is quite sweet and dense ; lots of white grapes , oak , alcohol and sugar pops out of the glass . a little vitamin b , some spice , anise and a touch more wood are all here . good , not great . alright , here goes . the first thing upon tasting this beer is that i 'm shocked at how carbonated this is . surely the fizziest , crackling-ist 13 % brew i 've had . nearly champagne like , once you get past the bubbly you 're rewarded with a sweet ( almost syrupy ) , smooth nectar . the alcohol is quite noticable but for some reason i do n't mind ... our friend white grape is back , along with a fresh , heavy oak note and i have to admit it all tastes pretty good ... is it $ 40 good ? hmm ... . best have some more to be sure ... mouthfeel is again highly carbonated , body is medium with a dry , yeasty finish . sweet oak flavor lingers on my tongue . nice . so should you buy this brew ? that 's a tough one . if spending $ 40 on a single bottle of ale for a special occasion does n't phase you , then by all means . all things considered , i 'm a bit nonplussed ... i mean i could buy four nice bombers or a case of something decent for the price of a single scaldis prestige . the price looms over everything and there is no way around it . bottom line : a tasty , overpriced beer that just might be good for your big day ."

S'poured from the tap at the bar into a clear pint glass at willougbhy brewing company about one hour ago . a minimal 1.0 cm head , dark yellow . s minimal hoppy smell , hiding its potent taste to come . t bitter to the point of being acidic . the bitter taste unfortunately continued on well into the after taste , a good 2 minutes after tasting . i appreciated the rye taste while it was still in my mouth ... but then again it could have been because the cold temperature masked the bitterness ... but bitter is certainly the word here . m full , just very bitter . d awful . i drank 20 % of my pint , paid and left the place .'

S'i acquired an extra can of this so i decided to review it as unobjectionable as possible . 12oz vented wide mouth can poured into a pint glass . pours a golden yellow color with a thin fizzy white head that quickly disappears . the aroma is pretty non-existent with faint grainy malt . the taste much like the aroma is pretty bland with a faint grain flavors and just a hint of hops . the mouthfeel is thin and prickly from the high amount of carbonation . the drinkability is high due to the low abv , but i am not sure i would want to consume much in one sitting due to getting bored . overall , a pretty subpar american macro light lager .'

S"appearance : this beer pours a deep onxy black with a creamy thick light brown head . the head is definitely here to stay as it is still standing strong after literally thirty minutes of letting the beer warm to an appropriate drinking temperature . smell : the aroma of this beer is of lightly brewed coffee , bitter chocolate , and roasted caramel . there is a body and depth to the aroma that i can only describe as creamy and coating . all smells are subtly blended together into a pleasant mellow aroma . taste : this beer has a slight malty bready sweetness which fades into hints of bitter coffee with a mild dry chalkyness . these very mellow flavors then fade into a lingering ashy burnt bitterness that is extremely prominent on the back of the tongue . mouthfeel : this beer has a definite creamy silky component from the wonderful nitro-infused head . the beer itself has a very light body , but with a slight slickness that gives the perception of a medium bodied beer . drinkability : this beer is extremely drinkable due to it 's light body , creamy head , and mellow flavors . overall impression : this is not a beer that will wow your socks off with intensity of flavor or aroma . rather , it is a mellow , quaffable , pub ale that i think would be perfect for long evenings of shooting the breeze with good friends . i think the easy drinking nature of this beer is a showcase and a perfect beer for someone who wants a light pub ale with a little with a roasted twist . it would pair exceptionally well with traditional pub grub like fish and chips , thick rich stews , or steamed oysters ."

S"this is my first steam beer/california common ... whatever you want to call it ! a : pours an amber body with a small white head . there was decent retention , but eventually slowed to a nice lacing that held to the finish . s : not much of a smell . smelled slightly malty and alcoholic . t : tastes like `` beer . '' reminded me a lot of a macro light lager but tasted a lot smoother . also , tasted slightly salty , which was interesting . m : a nice , light mouthfeel that was rather crisp . d : definitely a drinkable beer . does not really taste like much , but it was pretty light and easy to drink . definitely good for the summer or grilling ."

S"pint from kilkenney 's on the redondo beach pier last night for five dollars , sadly went to this bar with naja 's less than a couple hundred feet away , but my friends wanted to meet some people there , the things i do for them sometimes color was a golden brown with a third of an inch foamy white head , a little lacing with a murky appearance to it smell was sweet malts , with some caramel and sour fruit , also some bready aromas taste was nice and would make a great session beer , sweet like the smell seemed , slightly sour finish with a crisp bite at first , some biscuit-like accents , could taste some a little bit of toffee , some lemons and oranges , sweet syrup feel at times , also a hint of nuttiness , the only problem i had with this one was the lack of hops , but a nice beer overall that is easy to put down average amount of carbonation and a fairly nice body could drink several of these , especially at only four percent alcohol , super light beer that goes down easier than most out there , another good beer from alaskan"

S"i apologize for all you hop hounds out there that cant get enough crammed into a pint glass but the choice of hops is what did this one in . as stated above the nose , appearance and gravity of this one were all good . but the hops . it was n't that there was too much alpha acid , that i can handle . it was the aftertaste . too rancid , very piney . i might have had a bad batch but until i get the chance again my grade will remain low ."

S"firstly , i 'm not even sure what to call the serving type - dave schuster and i were at the cantillon brewery and were getting our samples at the end of the tour . i politely asked if they had an faro or unblended lambic and was told that there was n't any around . then an older man put on an apron , grabbed a hammer , bucket , and pitcher , went off somewhere and came back with a pitcher full of the unblended lambic . much appreciated - lovely people at cantillon . served in a flute glass - this was 2 years old . a - well , as per the style it was totally uncarbonated - there was maybe a touch of wispy foam if one swished it around and the faintest ring around the edge of the glass . the brew was a hazed golden apricot color with some visible sediment . i 'm not sure how to objectively review this - the color was nice , but as beer it was not what one generally seeks out . i guess it was good for what it was ? s - super funk with some sourness , some white wine , oak , apple cider vinegar , horse blanket , and mustiness . the funkiness is quite potent and the other smells are mostly peripheral . still it 's not aggressive like some of the gueuze i 've had , and it 's quite nice . t - the taste is much milder and more mellow - a lot of graham cracker and marmalade sweetness that ends with a sour and funky finish . it actually reminded me of zwanze '08 , which is n't surprising as the lambic portion is about the same age and is the `` base beer '' for zwanze . m - very similar to white wine - soft , some residual dry sourness , light side of medium bodied . not a ton to describe here , but it was nice . d - i 'd heard so much about unblended lambic being aggressive and harsh , but this was n't any of those things . the cask-style texture , low abv , and lovely taste make this extremely session-worthy . indeed this used to be the most popular cantillon product 100 years ago . highly recommended if you happen to be in brussels ."

S'pours a hazy amber in color with a 2 finger cloudy white head ; lacing was ok , but nothing to write home about . smells of sweet malt , hops and a touch of yeast ; very basic aroma . tastes of sweet malt , hops , caramel , grass or hay and a hint of fruit , with very light carbonation . crisp and light with an overall sweet malty flavor , this did not offer much as far as taste goes , but it was boring and basic enough to be enjoyable . a decent euro lager that goes down smooth and easy and scores extra points because it is very cheap for a 20 oz bottle .'

S"another nice surprise from gd , for some reason i always overlooked it in the beer aisle . definately worth a try . medium amber with the slightest chill haze and a huge pillow of oat hued head that retains like cool whip and laces fantastically . i do n't think i 've ever seen such an attractive esb . aroma is bold and fragrant , with plenty of chewy caramel malt sweetness balanced by generous fruit and floral tones with subtle hints of orange blossoms . flavor is similar to the nose . chewy golden caramel up front with plenty of wildflower and harvest fruit . it finishes bittersweet , a nice tug-o-war between the malt and the hops . body is medium with creamy carbonation and a slick , silky texture . i need to pick up a sixer and go to town . thanks to alaskaiscold for the sample ."

S'this brew pours a pale golden straw hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head with a rim of lacing , the smell is a mix of lemon/citrus and sweet malts , it has a nice light very sessionable mouthfeel to it with tastes of lemon zest , orange , spicy herbal hops and is rounded out with a sweet biscuty malt finish , overall even though there is nothing wrong with this brew they definately have better beers and if this was abit cheaper i could see this as a nice session beer especially for the summer .'

S"i developed a mild affinity to this beer back when i was in italy , poor , and could get this at the 'penny market ' for 1.50 euros a six pack . but now a few years later i will rate it . looks like a pils as it should . pale , gold and nice white head . lacing a plenty too . aroma is pleasing . light , spicy , herbal and floral . not bad hop extract usage . malts are light and bready . taste is good as well . nothing super amazing but this is a good beer for the money . taste has a good spicy hop kick and solid moderate bitterness . no off flavors and very drinkable in true lager fashion . ( i would recommend the 12 packs which are n't stuck under lights throughout their shelf life ) . if i recall correctly , the bottles of this beer we bought numerous times in italy were brown . better than average and like i said , worth the money ."

S'pours in to a pint glass an extremely murky reddish brown , leaving plenty of sediment at the bottom of the bottle . very little off white head that fades away to a ring around the glass . nose is full of hugely aromatic malts , amaretto , cherries , plums , alcohol presence , and an earthy hop presence as well . flavor is more of an explosion of dark , ripe fruits bombarding the pallete with raisins , plums , cherries , very reminiscient of a good barleywine , with a strong bitter hop finish taking over the palette in the end that holds on for dear life , alongside a deeply alcohol warming effect down the gullet . mouthfeel is extremely heavy and syrupy , light carbonation , and semi-dry , bitter finish . i tend to think that this beer is a bit too extreme , and that is its downfall . good to have one once in a while in place of a barleywine , but other than that , i shall pass . i expected much more to be honest . way over the top .'

S"received earlier today , thanks jeff . could n't wait to crack this one even though i 'd rather let it age for a bit . hope i made the right decision ! black pour with a finger of head that drops down to a collar and leaves some webs of lacing . the smell is very smooth whiskey and toasted malts . much more well integrated than even a year old 12th anniversary . surprisingly subdued even . hints of wood , toffee , and marshmallow in the background . a bit of agitation causes some boozy burn to rise . pretty nice . the taste is very big on burnt caramel maltiness . vanilla on the mid palate , and an acrid coffee bean bitterness in the finish . some hot booze rises up after the initial flavors pass . notes of pine resin and some harsh oak . not sure this one is quite ready yet , i would advise holding onto your bottles for at least 6 months or so . there is definitely some potential here though . mouthfeel is awesome . heavy and rich with a tad bit of carbonation sting which is the only thing keeping this from being a 5 in this category . one thing i have found with the 2 firestone anniversary beers that i have had the honor of drinking is they are unmistakably blends . i do n't find that meshing of flavors that really makes a huge beer like this easy to drink , or even desirable really . i would drink this any time it was offered , but i would be hard pressed to purchase one if i saw it on a store shelf other than as a mere experiment to see how time changes it . this is definitely an above average beer , but in the world of gigantic barrel aging it is not on par with its peers ."

S"~ 12 oz bottle . i will start out by saying i love german beers , so my review on this one may be a little biased . with that said , for a mass-produced beer , this is a simple german pilsner . best enjoyed ice cold on a hot summer day , and is very refreshing . i guess i am a sucker for great marketing campaigns because a beautiful blonde woman in a mini skirt holding an ice cold bottle of this stuff will always catch my attention : - ) ps- google : katarina van derham ( st. pauli 's girl 2009 spokesmodel ) and if you have already rated this beer , then re-rate . you may just find your new overall score to be a point or two higher ! ~"

S"the maibock style of beer tends to be lighter in color than other bock beers and often has a significant hop character with a noticeable alcohol around the same as a traditional bock . maibocks are customarily served in the spring and are oftentimes interrelated with spring festivals and celebrations more often in the month of may . taken from the description , yes it is lighter in color . ok malt or hops , i can tell the resemblance of hops now . learning here as i go along from sip to sip . according to the time schedule i am a little late in drinking this one . funny , it 's a new selection at the store i bought it at . i 'm glad i bought this in the varity pack not that it is n't good but not my style of beer . but it has been a good beer to experience the specific style from tonight ."

S"500ml bottle # 05058 into 25oz snifter . absolutely pitch black , there is no light getting through this one . the foam in the head is almost as dark as chocolate frosting . it starts out about one finger high then quickly dissolves to a thick rim , which slowly ends up as a permanent thin rim along the glass . the alcohol is in the foreground in this one , even when still cold , adding a little bit of a sharp spice . deep , highly roasted malts are mixed with some strong molasses , adding the only little bit of sweetness in the aroma . there 's maybe a faint hint of cocoa . some dark fruit is in the background - maybe plum and some red cherry . incredibly burnt flavors , met with a good amount of strong alcohol . the overall flavor carries a bit of an acerbic bitterness . heavy black coffee and bitter chocolate flavors . the coffee comes out more as the beer warms , but so does the alcohol . full bodied , thick , and oily . lots of good flavors in this one , but they are hidden behind the sharp alcohol . ca n't say what this one will be like after a few years , but possibly less harsh ."

S'notes from 11/25/2009 on-tap poured into a 12oz tulip at the brewpub first belgian ive had on tap , poured a ruby red color with a decent head , as other belgians ive had this tastes a little bit like a wine with nutmeg and cinnamon , it did drink nice and smooth not exactly my cup of tea as its a little high in abv % to be a constant order but worth a try at least once a season'

S"appearance : a crystal-clear , golden-straw body absolutely packed with bubbles . up top , two fingers of creamy white head that fade slowly and leaves excellent lacing . aroma : lots of herbal , citrusy , juicy , and piney hops over a sweet pale malt body . flavor : up front , a wave of moderately bitter , resinous , green , and juicy hops . underneath , a solid backbone of pale malt and wheat keeps everything balanced nicely . just a light hint of alcohol coming through from time to time . crackery malt and mildly spicy and herbal hops in the finish . mouthfeel : medium bodied and a little creamy with moderate carbonation and a dry finish . drinkability : as advertised , this is an easy drinker ( provided you do n't hate hops ) . just watch out for the moderately high alcohol content . verdict : a little sumpin ' sumpin ' is an enjoyable little beer ; it 's tasty , easily drinkable , and packs a hidden punch . as far as summer seasonals go , this is just what i 'm looking for ."

S'poured on tap at winterfest . a- pours a light hazed golden yellow color . one finger white head shows light retention . spotty lacing on the sides of the glass . s- while sniffing this beer i picked up a lot of noble hops along with some earthy hop tones as well . the pilsner malt seems to be stuffed in the bottom of the aroma profile . there is a sweet alcohol that is also coming through . overall sweet , earthy , and some alcohol hints . t- the upfront of this has a sweet malt presence ... more caramel than anything else . the alcohol already shows up for the first time toward the middle of the beer and never really leaves . middle of the beer is really clean tasting with alcohol really driving the flavor . ending is a bitter noble hop like crispness in the backing with some warming alcohol . m- medium mouthfeel . carbonation was crisp and good for the style . light heat from alcohol and sweet malt left on the palate . aftertaste is mostly fading hop bitterness , warming alcohol , and faded malts . flavors overall were lightly balanced and right for the style . the alcohol was a light annoyance at times leading to some small offness i thought . medium-heavy drying on the palate from the alcohol . d- this beer is good but the dryness and abv make this just a one and done . i would drink a couple pints of these although to be honest i would be a little bored with the flavor profile .'

S"well i 'm honored to be the apparent 1st canadian to be reviewing this beer ! a- i was actually impressed by the look of this beer ! there is a thick , although fizzy white head that takes a few minutes to settle into a thin layer over the beer . it is a hazy yellowish color that reminds me of wheat , so i ca n't tell how carbonated it is . there is some modest lacing clinging to my glass so were off to a good start for a bl product ! s- very light and honestly not all that appealing , what there is ... .it has very mild grainy and citrus aromas . other than that , is it kind of skunked and raw smelling ... almost kind of like urine . t- fortunately , the taste is a notch above the smell . the first thing i notice is some modest sweetness malt . there is also some mild spice from the coriander . there 's also a hint of citrus , but it 's not a distinct flavor . no real bitterness on the finish and no lingering flavors on the palate afterward . expected for a light beer i guess . m- thin bodied but surprisingly not the watery feel that i was expecting ... just not good enough to call medium bodied . the carbonation is plentiful in a moderate palate scrubbing way . not the worst texture i 've felt but certainly not the best . d- i will give it this , bud actually came out with a light beer that has some character . unlike their bl standard or lime , this has some modest flavor that does n't taste like either nothing or artificial garbage . the alcohol is well hidden by the sweetness and it 's not filling ... .i 'd have no problem spending an afternoon on the patio enjoying these !"

S"got this one after having a dfh 90 min . from the tap . `` damn , is this stuff hop bitter '' , i said to myself as i downed the 90 . i saw a 12 oz . bottle of the 120 in the back of the cooler and took it home . i waited about a week before trying it . i wanted a real unbiased opinion . i read about the bitterness units and the 120 blew away the 90 . so the rating said . when i finally opened the 120 the first sip was alcohol , followed by sweet . somewhere in there the hops kicked in but from what i remembered , i though the 90 was much more harsh . i took me 35 minutes to down the one bottle . you have to sip this like cognac . while i did like the smell , taste and mouthfeel , drinkability suffers . i could n't do more than one bottle . first , the 20 abv will have you ready for a root canal with out novacaine . ( i was buzzed for more than an hour from one bottle . ) second , it 's way to sweet/hoppy . and third , i do n't know if it 's the alcohol or the hops or the combination of everything but , i had some wicked heartburn after this one . this is a good one for those special occasions when you need to forget the world for a while . like when your house burns down or something . two 120 's and you 'll forget everything . i 'm glad i tried this one but i ca n't see me coming back for more ."

S"`` i have crafted this very special ale from the finest goldings hops , tripple malted barley and of course our unique yeast to create a truly extraordinary limited edition brew . individually packaged an numbered , this bottle is one of only one hundred and sixty thousand produced . although we are obliged to state a best before date of 2012 , like a fine wine or whisky this mellow golden ale will improve with age for many more years . this 2009 edition marks 12 years of brewing this magnificent ale . being bottle conditioned , the beer will form a natural sediment ; so pour carefully , sit back , and enjoy this , the very finest of fuller 's ales. `` - john keeling , head brewers for fuller 's brewery . and in fact , it was bottle number 050155 which i enjoyed thoroughly with my roommate this past weekend . the fuller 's vintage is among my favorite all time bottles , and comes each year in a sturdy red box . the beautiful sentiment above by fuller 's head brewer john keeling is printed in fine cursive on the back of every box of fuller 's vintage ale 2009 . it comes out each year near christmas , and i make sure that i always stock up on several to enjoy for the season , and many more to age in my cellar for years to come . a vintage ale is really a beautiful thing . each year the brewery comes back to the previous years brew and determines how he can improve upon it , what subtle or extreme modifications can be made , or how can it be more unique and adventurous . regardless of what the purpose of that specific vintage is , they are all crafted to be enjoyed now , and for many years to come . one of the many jobs of beer drinking is to be able to sit down and enjoy several different vintages of the same beer - ie . enjoying the fuller 's vintage 2005 through to 2009 . somehow also , the british definitely know exactly what to do when it comes to the vintage . maybe its their history of brewing , or the nature of the raw materials which they grow . regardless of any fact , year in and year out fuller 's produces a vintage beer which makes my mouth water and drool for days if not more . the 2009 fuller 's vintage ale is 8.5 % abv and comes in a 500ml dark and heavy glass bottle . in my humble opinion it is among the most handsome and classy bottles in the world . beyond that , it does come in a red box as shown here , making it a very unique beer which stands out and commands presence on beer shelves . the 2009 vintage pours aggressively as if it has been"

S"pours a lightly hazy washed-out peach/gold . the head is glaring white , but does n't stick around very long . the aroma is good , no doubt , but you have to love ginger to get into it , because that 's all there is : big-ass ginger . i can not detect anything else underneath it . either i do n't have the olfactory talent of others , or have a poor imagination , but that 's all i get . in the flavor , the ginger remains top dog . seems on the medium spice level , if we 're going by ginger ale soda standards . unlike the nose , a few other elements push through , like lemon , clover , white pepper and honey . alcohol pushes in with warming , and together with the spice heat , this beer ends up feeling pretty `` hot . '' the wheat seems only a subtle base -- the ginger covers up anything trying to be subtle here . more wheat , please . texture is slick and has a gentleness to it , even kind of fluffy -- but the carbonation ( as unobtrusive as it is ) and especially the hammering ginger flavor give the sensory illusion of feeling more aggressive than it really is . drinkability : low . not one i will buy again . actually had a hard time finishing this bottle . i will say the ginger ( and other flavorings , like honey and lemon juice ) have a totally natural character -- nothing tastes plastic or artificial . but it 's just too damn gingery . and i love ginger , but i guess i prefer it in my tea and thai food rather than beer ."

S"belzebuth pur malt ( 13 % version ) presentation : light brown , 25 cl bottle with a devil figure on the front . `` extra strong beer '' and a big `` 13 % alcohol '' on the front . information about the beer on the back ; best by date of 01/28/05 . poured into a pint glass . appearance : pours a deep , caramel brown color with tons of very active carbonation . small , almost non-existent head that dissipates quickly , although it does leave behind a moderate amount of lacing . smell : very syrupy , cloyingly sweet alcohol aromas mixed with some ripe fruits . similar aroma to dfh 's raison d'tre , but cruder . taste : the taste of belzebuth is completely dominated by sweet , syrupy malt flavors . lots of dark fruit , raisin-like notes , although the flavor gives was to spicy pepper . for a beer with such a huge alcohol content , there 's obviously a warming alcohol presence , and a strong alcohol aftertaste . when the beer is cold , a sweet , almost brandy-like aftertaste , although this fades to pure alcohol as it warms . hops are completely absent from the flavor , save for a few hints of lingering bitterness before the beer reaches room temperature . mouthfeel : syrupy , thick mouthfeel that coats the tounge . drinkability : obviously , with the 13 % alcohol content this is n't god forbid a session beer . as it warms , the syrupy character gets more pronounced and the alcohol becomes more obvious , hurting drinkability . an interesting offering from brasserie grain d'orge . obviously not a session beer , and as a sipper it lacks the complexity of the some of the bigger offerings from sierra nevada , victory , or dogfish head . also , for a beer with such a high alcohol content , belzebuth seems like a surprisingly bad candidate for cellaring i do n't really see any immature flavors that would come out with age , since the flavor is dominated by the malt . nevertheless , a fun beer to find as a novelty , but not something i 'm buying on a regular basis . if you have a chance , check it out ."

S"a bomber of coffeehouse porter , i wondered if i would be sat up all night , looking like an electrocuted australian marsupial after drinking all of this offering from the berkshire brewing company . it is has a very deep burnt chestnut conker color . the head sank faster than the luxury car carrying ferry the 'tricolor ' in the english channel , but unlike the ferry it can not be salvaged . a nice , finely defined , interwoven lace pattern clings to the upper inner walls , but it develops into a much simpler pattern further down as you drink the beer . nose is . what is that smell ? no dont tell me ! i do know it , its er , its , erm , come on think bum what is it i know , i know ! ! its , er , er , er c-c-c-coffee ( applause ) . thats it ! as a thoroughly traditional english tea drinker who has created his own piece of the raj in la , i stop work at 3pm for tea and a bit of fruit crumpet , for i am no fan of coffee , but i find i do have a strong affinity for this porter . concentrating hard , apart from the ott coffee tastes , it appears to be rather a thin beer , and i have a sneaky suspicion that the starbucks on acid special flavoring masks quite a thin brew . this is indeed perceptible in the mouthfeel . close your eyes ignore the coffee , and there is not much else there , it is a rather thin porter . mouthfeel is silky smooth though , and has a lovely roast toffee caramel taste in the middle quite addictive . the finish is coffee though , that has a habit of leaving a deeply burnt coffee skid-mark on your tongue . although i would admit that the drinkability is average , i would say that perhaps 2 bombers of this - and i would buzzed . oh , and i had to laugh at the statement on the label , porter with natural flavor added what ? isnt that an oxymoron , or am i just being pretentious ? joking aside , i do actually like this beer , and i find it to be a unique beer , distinctive and it also comes in a rather grown-up 22 fl.oz bottle . whether i could have a session on this though , i am not so sure . we have scones , strawberry jam & devon cream - more tea vicar ? ? ? thanks to bigdeb for this caffieneious offering ."

S"review is from notes taken on 2/21/2010 and puored from the bottle to a pint glass . appearance : the pour is a very light coppery/straw yellow golden color and starts with a solid one finger white head that has great retention and slowly fades to a full skim ; body is pretty clear and shows tons of carbonation bubbling throughout ; a few spots of lacing are left behind . smell : pretty solid an straightforward - light citric hops that are of orange and lemon peel scents ; a lightly dry and toasty graininess -- just smells `` crisp . '' taste : much like the smell , it just tastes crisp , clean and refreshing ; lightly balanced between the citrusy hops ( but not bitter at all though ) ; the lightly toasted and dried graininess and a nice sweet maltiness in the back -- flavors are n't especially robust but they are very true to the cream ale style . mouthfeel : for as solid as the carbonation is , the body is actually pretty smooth and creamy ; light and crisp and finishes very clean leaving nothing behind . drinkability : really no reason to not drink this all day - would be a great beer for the summer if you 're working outside or at a bbq and will be outside all day . abv is very manageable and this would be a great session beer ."

S"had this on tap at burrito loco when out after work with some co-workers sometime last week . this is anheuser-busch 's lesser known stab at taking away some of coors blue moon sales . i have to say , i 'm definitely going to choose blue moon over this every time . so i never actually intended on ordering this . pints where two for ones , and i ordered a grain belt ( cheapest on the menu ) . after the first pint , the keg ran out , and the bartender said i could have anything else they have on tap as a substitute . `` fat tire '' i said . `` oh ... sorry that kegs empty too . '' ok ... so naturally i chose the only beer on tap that i had never had before . i knew shock top was an ab beer , but i really did n't care . i thought it was worth giving a shot . definitely looks like a typical belgian wit . served with an orange slice , beer is a hazy light golden color . lively carbonation , and surprising head . also , impressive lacing , was n't expecting that . the nose is typical of a cheaper belgian wit . much like blue moon , but a little more watered down . very light citrus and spice nose . taste is much what you would expect , watered down . not saying it 's bad , but it 's just not doing it for me . there is some glinks of great taste , but they are too watered down for my taste . body is light to medium , leaning towards the light side . ample carbonation makes for a crisp brew . this one , believe it or not , is pretty dang refreshing on a hot humid afternoon . very high drinkability , very easy going down . i 'm not going to say i 'm a fan . but i will say this . if i 'm ever in the situation again where my only choices are this or no beer , i 'm going to reach for this . it 's not terrible , i just like blue moon better . for what it 's worth , i would take this over any other anheuser-busch product any day ."

S"22oz bottle poured into a snifter . big props to russwbeck for sharing this , thanks russ ! a - pours a deep , golden amber color . it 's pretty cloudy , but not with any noticeable chunks of sediment . a modest pour yields about 1.5-fingers of head that has pretty good retention , lasting well into the glass . lacing is almost non-existent . s - relatively light and floral , surprisingly . not sure what habiscus smells like , but i will trust the bottle and believe there 's a good presence here . i 'm getting some dandelion , and it really reminds me of victory prima pils at first for some reason . maybe the floral hops here . some slight vinegar , but not overly sour in the least . t - as far as sours go , this one is much more mild than i would 've expected . given the description of brett and lacto , i was expecting a quite sour beer here . rather , its relatively floral and hoppy up front , and the sourness , however faint , comes next . if you are looking for mouth-puckering sour , look elsewhere , as this only gives a relatively mild vinegar , lemon , tart cherry sour . m - mouthfeel is relatively light-bodied with good carbonation . not incredibly sour , but pretty tart . pretty good lasting impression , but again , do n't come in expecting an amazingly sour beer . d - drinkability is relatively high . if i were rating to style , i feel this is a fairly weak wild , but in terms of ease of drinking and flavors , its quite pleasant and refreshing . i ca n't shake the impression that this is prima pils with a tart component ."

S"once again the sleeman version of the beer , i wish i could get the real mccoy tho , onto the review ! apperance - light yellow colour , not very appealing . smell - no off smells , hints of metallic , smells fresh . a hint , hint of hops . taste - very smooth , little hop prescence , carbonated . crisp finish . mouthfeel - velvety smooth , full . drinkability - through the roof . honestly this beer is very poundable . very easy to suck 12 back . nuff said . hands down , for a buck a beer in ontario , this is the ultimate buck a beer , and my favorite discount macro . whether it be out of a can or a bottle it simply is , the best cheap beer you can get ! give this one a try , do n't listen to the fools ."

S'edit : i was told buy a trusted pal , that when he had this beer fresh it was very yummy . he and i tend to rate with similar scores . i am going to attempt to try this beer again , but leave this review for now . seeing as how the sample i had not gone bad in any infection sort of way . it just may not age well . : *i hated it and would never buy it* app : brown garnet . thin lookin , looks fine not amazing . smells : bad , menthol , minty herby plants . some malts hide back there . taste : it is not good at all , it is way way spiced , its not good spiced . way over the top . mf : fine . drinkable ? : no , it is hard and painful to drink !'

S"served at max 's during 72 hours of belgium . this is , based on distributed notes , the first time it has been served on draught in the u.s. a : the ale is a cloudy creek water brown , showing off some red tones . not much head sits atop the ale . s : the nose is a peat wet dream , thick with smoky notes that are damn near chewable . this is no bourbon barrel wonder , scotch creates an awesome smell . t : like the best rauchbiers , this beer is so meaty that you can chew it . the whisky barrels ( note the spelling ) add a delicious peat flavor that has some sea salt bite . the peat envelops the ale , permeating every aspect . there really is n't any indication that this is a belgian ale , the barrel has so taken it over . but wow , what a way to go . m : like meat aging in a smokehouse , this beer is a meal . so chewy and thick , it 's hard to but the glass down . d : damn ! 11 % ? no wonder i was a little tipsy this morning ( okay , a lot tipsy ) . hopefully more places will see it on draught now that max 's has popped the cherry ."

S"with a delightfully dense amber color , festbier 's appearance is beautiful and on-point for the style . the smell and taste are testaments to its german malts which dominate the nose and palate . the hops sneak themselves behind the sweet and buttery first wave and barely hit the side of your tongue with slight bitterness , but then the malts come back for the finally . the flavor is too unbalanced for me , weighing heavily on the malty sweet. , almost buttered bread , side . overall , festbier is a malty , buttered bread experience that spoils my appetite , especially during a big octoberfest celebration where you are encouraged to drink a few rounds . i am , however , tasting this offering on the later end of it 's life-span , so it is very likely the hop flavor has subsided , thus creating an imbalance ."

S"i 've been wanting to try this beer for quite some time now and thanks to overlord i finally will ! i think a stout brewed with coffee will do nicely this morning . pours pitch black into my delerium snifter . i do n't even see ruby around the edges . the foam was hefty and looked like puffy chocolate mousse . looks beautiful . it 's been too long since i 've had a stout with a head this dark . the nose is a little fainter than expected but there 's still plenty of coffee in it . has a sweetness to it that i can only liken to chocolate cake being baked . i like the smell but i was expecting it to be more pungent . fortunately the taste and mouthfeel are n't lacking and work together very well . thick , lush waves carrying across the tongue notes of burnt malt , very roasty and rich coffee and chocolatey goodness . the coffee flavor is pretty strong and concentrated . it 's like someone ran a brewed pot through some more fresh beans and a dash of hops in the machine . ( yes i 've tried that . ) the chocolate starts dark and bitter but finishes milky and sweet . there 's a bit of a smokey and sweet yet bitter/hoppy finish that will dry out the back of your throat . also , the 12 % is n't exactly hiding , but it 's not kicking you in the arse either . it 's a great beer and a pleasure to drink , but it 'll take me a while to finish it . the overwhelming flavors coupled with the abv obviously does n't make for a sessioner . i probably should have shared it , but luckily you can take your time with it because it 's fun seeing how it changes as it warms ."

S'a murky cider colored brew with a whispy white head and scant lace . the aroma is a very nice , solid grapefruit hops with a fair butterscotch malt . the first taste kills that sweet suggestion from the aroma and substitutes a strong alcohol dominanace . after you adjust to the high octane the sweetness does begin to return . the flavor becomes more candied apricot with caramel touches . the hops are not so obvious at first but improve as it warms , more earthy than citrus perhaps . it is mildly carbonated and fairly full bodied , a nice feel but this is too strong for sessioning . it has a complex flavor , a rich feel , but the alcohol is a bit overdosed for my preferences . a quality effort none-the-less and one any hophead should sample . start it at room temperature and proceed slowly to savor the subtleties .'

S"a= pretty sure this is a 1997 bottle . this beer is from my first trade ever and i 'm a little nervous to try it ... i 'm holding my breathe . pours a thick brown not quite as black as i expected . looks black in the glass but if you look at the pour its brown . no carbonation on it which i expected seeing as how old it is so no points lost . looks pretty good . like the angels share i just had . s= quite pungent i can smell it from about five feet away . there is lots and lots of maple syrup . there 's a little bit of the imfamous soy sauce but not as much as its played up to be . there 's a lot of vanilla and oakiness to it as well . t= ok here 's where it goes downhill a little bit . the taste is definitilly soy saucy . it is however masked by a thick maple taste alcohol hotness and a ton of dark chocolate to finish . the flavor is really sort of unexpected and blow you away crazy i dunno if i can finish it but i 'm happy i tried it . m= thick as hell and hot . sticky and feels on your lips like cough syrup sort of . d= not good at all . while it looked ok and smelled great this is the hardest beer i 've had to finish but i wo n't pour it out . thanks to kadonney for my first trade and this interesting beer ."

S"had this while in macedonia . this is basically the national beer of macedonia , being everywhere ... often the only choice around . luckily , it 's an ok lager . a : poured from the 500ml glass bottle into an imperial pint . the beer is a nice gold color , slightly pale , with a nice off white head . s : good clean aroma , a bit hoppy , a lot more grainy . pretty typical , but not bad . t : again very grainy here with a slight bitter twang near the end . kind of sweet . finishes clean and refreshing with a balanced character that is a bit rough but pretty tasty . no real off notes to speak of - just a good classic lager . f and d : a bit rough , but refreshing . i drank a bunch of these while here in macedonia . a good local choice where the others are overpriced options like tuborg , becks , etc . oddly enough this is made by heineken i think , but overall pretty solid"

S"aromas are of slight dark malts , mainly chocolate and coffee . but the main smell is of dark , burnt caramel presumably from candy sugar . slight belgian yeast as well . taste is pretty darn dissapointing . i was expecting a nice belgian ale but i got a belgian stout . i mean i love belgian stouts but i was having a flight of stouts and wanted a nice sweet belgian dark ale to complement and this did not fulfil my expectations . belgian stouts are great but are dominated in taste profile compared to american beefed up versions . maybe this beer would be good on it 's own but in a flight with rogue 2x chocolate stout and great divide yeti it 's flavor is lost . maybe i am too harsh on brooklyn but this beer falls flat for me . i was hoping and expecting much more based on the reviews but i mean as a belgian dark ale or a belgian stout this beer left me wanting much more ."

S'an extremely consistent brewery with some rather high volume excellent offerings , but have this one as fresh as possible . orange with nice and lacy head . nose of a floral mango lychee notes that is rather momentary . not a bottling beer . soon settles into a proper apple orange marmalade . clear with a nice blend of fruit . a treat of a dipa and not a staple regular drink . stands alone as a accented ipa but runs a bit bigger .'

S'bright golden pour into the appropriate brooklyn chalice , a high paper white head falls quickly , leaving little lace . aroma is fresh and inviting ; pale malts , specey yeast , banana , clove , and fruit . a notion of grassy hops round it out . the flavor is fruity and vibrant and not as sweet as the nose . it smacks of bubblegum and banana with clove and light coriander notes . the mildly hopped finish has grass and noble bitterness , but not much . this is very much a belgian session beer imo , i would love a keg of this on tap at home during the lawnmowing months . body is on the light side which is perfect for this complex quencher . i could honestly drink this all night .'

S'pours a slightly cloudy amber with a gigantic frothy head . obvious high carbonation . aromas of cloves , cinnamon , and pepper , along with plum , sweet cherries and a faint alcohol smell . taste : whoa . this beer is tart ! a pronounced lactic sourness presides over this beer . i wonder if i somehow got a tainted bottle , but the tartness seems to be in harmony with the rest of the beer : cinnamon/allspice/pepper/clove . sweet caramel flavor in the background , and very little emphasis on the hops . above all the tanginess stands out . it is really a pleasant surprise , as i was expected a standard spicy belgian strong ale . instead i get a cross between that and an oud bruin . mouthfeel : high carbonation and the acidic twang help to lighten the body . good dry finish with a slight tangy aftertaste reminiscient of apples or pears . drinkability : until the acid gets to be too much , this beer is all good ... outstanding belgian brew . not sure it is technically a belgian strong pale , but the belgians have never been that concerned with style parameters .'

S"appearance : pours a very dark brown with some rusty highlights around the edges ; initially , it produced a fairly decent head , but that faded quickly to a ringlet while dotting the chalice with lace smell : the aroma is a bit of a muddle , frankly , with a rich dark chocolate and molasses tone , on the one hand , and a phenolic , plastic , artificial scent , on the other taste : i 'm afraid the taste profile follows the aroma , with a nice rich , roasty , dark chocolate character up front ; by mid-palate , the flavor starts to taste like burnt caramel and , unfortunately , it only goes downhill after the swallow , with a slightly sour finish mouthfeel : medium to full body with moderate carbonation ; still , a bit thin for the style drinkability : ultimately , the off flavors in the aroma and the taste make this one tough to finish"

S'a : poured a dark brown in color with reddish highlights but a thin yellow cap sitting on the top and no head leaving a zero amount of lacing sticking to the glass . s : i was able to sniff out lots of sweetness which consisted with dark fruits , brown sugar , caramel , toffee , molasses , and a little booze . t : the taste was really sweet upfront with the caramel , molasses , and dark fruits leading the way but had a touch of brown sugar . there was however slight hop character on the back end and a little booze as well . m : the brew was full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet , mild fruity , slight hoppy , boozy , and sticky finish . d : honestly was not an easy drinking brew and was a definite sipper . i could not take a gulp even if i tried to . pretty decent beer though all around .'

S'cellared for one year . pours a cloudy dark mahogany with one finger of off-white foam . soap bubble head drops quickly , but leaves specs of lacing and retains a cap of foam to the finish . toasted caramel flavor , with some black patent and chocolate that give depth to the flavor , but the malt profile is still too mild . distinctly bavarinan hop aftertaste , sligthly dry and creates a nice balance . the body and carbonation are light , lending a smooth mouthfeel , but much lighter than a typical porter . a strong bourbon aroma overpowers anything else , perhaps this was aged in whiskey barrels ? this may also contribute to the solventlike finish , that is more astringent than acidic or vinous , and becomes harsh near the end .'

S"poured from the bottle into a tulip . there are such a few amount of reviews out there for this beer . i do n't know if it 's from the price tag alone or from people who buy it refusing to put how disappointing this beer is into words . time to add one more negative deviation to my review count ... . the pour of this beer , aside from the fantastic 2+ fingers worth of head , was foreboding . more so than hitchcock 's opening to rebbecca . the appearance , in a word , was septic . i feared for my life and grabbed for a knife thinking that the creature from the black lagoon was going to pop out at any time and strike . okay , the lacing was nice . but the creature from the black lagoon could rip through nice curtains . the smell was just okay at best . there was caramel , raisins and a decent touch of hops in the mix . the oak barrel aging was noticeable in the smell , but not truly welcome . the taste . meh . i 've had plenty better in this style , that did n't cost so fucking much too . the mild hop profile blended well with the oak aging and fruit flavors , the raisins , maybe other dark fruits and the caramel again . my buddy noted it 's like bigfoot ale , we both agreed that that 's better though . there 's an earthyness to this beer though that probably comes from the oak aging and in this case , i do n't think adding it to the barrels truly in the end added a damn thing to the beer . it was more of an unwelcome house guest , one you ca n't say no to , you wish he was gone , but to keep up appearances you had to grin and bare his presence . the mouthfeel was okay , it was thick but not overbearing , something you can easily drink and enjoy . this beer has a twenty-six dollar price tag on it . that 's a lot of freaking money ! and i definitly say that it simply is not worth the money . i 've had much better beer in this style for a lot less money . this beer is rather pretentious . there 's limited quantities , it was aged in oak ( for no apparent reason ) and comes with a laughable price tag . if a beer was to ever sit in a proverbial ivory tower , this would be it . i wonder if the reviews are so high because people spent so much money on a beer , they want to believe it 's good . who wants to spend this much money and be disappointed ? if this beer was say , $ 8 , how much lower would the"

S'what a shame this beer is only released in the summertime . the beer pours a pretty standard golden color , with very little head . right away , the smell comes out and grabs you . lots of citrus here , followed by other fruit aromas . a hint of the malt peeks through . the smell is a good precursor for the taste . more citrus and fruit flavors . you can definitely make out some lemon/lime overtones . the wheat also makes its presence known . the wheat and fruit combine with just the right amount of alcohol , giving this beer one great taste . the mouthfeel is nothing outstanding , typical of an ale of this type . drinkability is off the charts . this beer is crisp , smooth and goes down easy . perfect for any occasion . perfect for a session beer and highly recommended by me .'

S"this beer comes from a 22oz bomber that says northwestern ale . an overaggressive pour ( oops ) yields an huge foamy head , off white with a lot of large bubbles . deep chestnut color and murky . dissipating cap begins to look like krausen . nose is mild mix of flowery hops and sweet malt . brings to mind brown sugar , whole grain bread , tangerine and dough . the foundational flavor of this red ale is a solid malt that 's toasty and sweet . riding over the top are bitter hop flavors like orange juice , sticky pine sap , and some green apple . these flavor levels get along for the most part and make for an interesting brew , but i 'd like to see slightly more flavor cohesion and interaction . ( as it warms , flavors begin to combine . ) mouthfeel is midweight and fine for the style . despite a lasting malty finish , this brew is quite bitter . overall , the interesting flavor profile and lack of funky flavors make this a solid beer , however , it 's not quite up to the delicious standard that other rogue ales have achieved ."

S"poured from a bottle to a sierra nevada pint glass . had a huge rocky head that faded fairly quickly and left gobs of lacing . the beer is lighter in color than the dale 's pale ale i just drank : a light orange with bubbles rising . the smell is faint malts and hops . the flavor is similar with sweet , pale malts and a slightly bitter finish . sweetwater 420 is extra pale , not an extra pale ale if that makes sense . it 's lighter on all the ingredients than a normal pale ale . still the flavor and smell that 's there is really good . locally this is a really popular beer . a great stepping stone up to more full and bitter beer . my 21 year old daughter likes this one quite a bit along with their blue . it has a great niche in the local market and it 's a really well made ale , just a little lighter than i personally prefer . the mouth feel is light and has slightly higher carbonation which makes it a very refreshing beer . i could drink these all day ; i ca n't think of a more sessionable ale ."

S"one of the many things i appreciate about the dogfish head brewery is the air of mystery that sometimes surrounds their brews . for instance , who are those two odd , chimp-faced chaps mugging at us on the label ? i like to think that they are manifestations of bottle imps trapped inside that are scheming to escape and bedevil whoever holds the vessel and dares to drink ... in fact , after downing a full 750 of this `` bulbous brown ale '' all on my lonesome , i 'm sure of it ! appearance : dark tawny brown , garnet-tinged edges , head is brown and fluffy white while it lasts , but gone in a quickness . aroma : powerful and winey , full of deep , dark , devilish fruity flavors , wicked stuff ! each sniff unturns more sensations , raisins , dates , leather , grapes , cognac , dark rum ... '' complex '' only starts to describe it ! time to drink ... thick mouthfeel ! an 800lb gorilla sitting on the palate ! washes all corners of the mouth with flavor , rich and sharp , yet syrupy , almost treacly , but definitely delicious . quickly intoxicating , this , and though the abv is left off the label , it must assuredly be abominable . only 1/3 of the way through the bottle now , and i feel totally whipped ! wish i had a secret cache of this to carry me through cold winter nights or to break out in celebration of some personal triumph , and i definitely need more of the latter than the former ! at this point , my notes from this sampling ( done in early september ) trail off into gibberish and surrealistic non-sequitors , ( what else is new ? ) but i can tie that all off and merely conclude that this was one incredible brew , very much enjoyed ! hats off to drews for getting this big , bad boy into my mitts !"

S'what only fathers like coffee ? pours a midnight dark color with a bubbly light tan head . not much hue throughout the edges . the lacing is limited as well is the retention . the nose is sweet even for coffee stout standards . some malty notes with a bit of lactic/milky notes . some lighter chocolate and a hint of coffee notes with a light roast aroma . some molasses notes with a bit of metallic/coiny aromas . some off yeast notes as well , with some phenolics and a subtle butyric aroma . the taste as more of the coffee aspect . the coffee comes out with a light roast backing but not much on the chocolate notes . some generic malt notes that blend but coffee is definitely the stronger of tastes . some minor lactic giving it a sweetness but not as much as the nose indicated . some wispy notes on the back end . the yeast is a bit cleaner but there is a light butyric note that reminds me of dirty drains . some chalky notes in the finish . the body is a bit wispy especially for a stout . really would have liked more body into the finish . some creamy up front , the finish is just disappointing . overall , i think the coffee notes come out because it really needs more of a malt backing . the lactic is really cloying as well .'

S"500 ml poured into a snifter . pale golden yellow with a moderate head that has subsided by the time i am typing this , but with some lacing at least . is this a lager ? i guess so , but i do n't get any lager funk in the nose from the yeast . a hint of it maybe , a little bit of malt and commercial hops . it 's fairly clean on the tongue , i 'll give it that much , but not much depth to the flavor . is it better than the big american adjuncts , bud , miller , coors , to which this is a similar style ? yes , but for the price it 's not as good as pilsner urquell or a few others that are roughly competitors to this brew . aftertaste is n't bad . it 's not yucky like coors or nothing like miller or stinky like bud . fairly drinkable . not bad for a random small grocery store pick-up , but not something i 'll ever get when there 's any kind of selection ."

S"since some 'coastal fog ' ( bevmo 's in house beer ) seem to come from different breweries , mine was labeled as having come from the tied house brewery , making it local if you 're in the bay area . bought my batch in march , 2010 . the bottling date was listed as 12/2009 , so not super old . a - dark copper , not much head . s - probably the weakest feature , lacking in aroma . but nothing off-putting , either . t - pleasant , drinkable . not particularly unique , and designed not to offend . a somewhat bashful amber ale , it 's subdued and would go well with food . m - medium body , good carbonation . dry , crisp . d - very drinkable , good session beer . does n't tire out your palate like some more 'in your face ' ales and the alcohol content is low , making it easy to have several . overall , it 's a good solid 'average ' amber ale -- but for the price , it 's a killer deal . great for parties , bbqs , and just keeping on stock as a backup beer or a basic everyday beer ."

S'picked this up because i like the great lakes commodore perry ipa . this beer poured amber in color . the head was cream colored and poured about three fingers thick . the lace was present throughout . the aroma was sharp , sweet , and strong . it resembled grapefruit with a touch if tea . the initial taste has a tremendous bite which is sharp at the front and sides of the tongue . it is , of course , hoppy . the grapefruit taste is still present . the tsste of tea does sneak in under the sharp taste of hops in the middle . the beer finishes with a sweet taste of hops and the bitterness lingers on your tongue . the beer has a good body , and it is extremely crisp . it is light , but not quite as dry as ipas that i am used to . if you like double ipas , this is a good one .'

S"rj wingwalker started showing up at the local jewel-oscos several months ago . i was skeptical at first , thinking this was another plank road type swindle . as far as i can tell though , it 's just a brewery that got distribution in a huge grocery store for some reason . that 's a good thing though , because i think this is the closest thing to real beer that i 've seen there yet . i 'm tired of having to get guiness or sierra nevada every time . plus they have frequent sales , i picked up a 12-pack for 10.99 yesterday ; they had fat tire on the same shelf for 16.99 . i do n't usually use a glass , so i do n't really know what it looks like . it already comes in a container that i can drink out of , ya know ? the smell , as other reviewer have said , tells you all you need to know . flowery hops and a strong citrus aroma . that 's pretty much what it tastes like . it 's a bit dry , and it 's hard to pound them down for some reason , despite the modest alcohol content . still , overall it 's a pleasant tasting beer and a great bargain . it 's got a bit more character that sierra nevada pale ale , the `` other '' grocery store beer ( around here anyway ) . i do n't know if this is available outside of chicagoland , but if you 're in the area and you need to go over there by jewels for some milk and eggs , check out the wine and spirits section , 'cause they have beer too ."

S"2010 : 12 from pearl st. beverage in burlington . this is the 2010 vintage . i 'll compare to the 2008 vintage , which i had right after this . clear cranberry hue ... not much lacing or foam to speak of . heavy and syrupy body , which i like . this body you can tell just from the scent , which is dark fruits , heavy amounts of sugar , and a snappy alcohol burn . very similar to a bsda but more well-rounded . taste has many vinous elements , darm malts with subdued hops . sticky mf and hot alcohol following up the back , but not in an offensive quantity . there is also a savory spicy quality that i have not met before . this would go well with thanksgiving dinner , for sure . 2008 : 12 from ebi in saratoga . dusty old 2008 vintage picked up in late 2009 . appearance is much different than the 2010 . still a garnet hue but this beer is almost totally opaque with turbidity . a coffee-crema ring of foam forms at the edge of the glass , looking to stay awhile . a deep , cherry and spicy prune and alcohol scent ... really intense , i found myself huffing it . methinks this one has improved significantly . the taste is also worth a few words , namely detailed elements of dark fruits like plum , cranberry , hot abv ( got at least one shiver from a good sip ) , still sugar there but less obvious and more effectively integrated . heavy and not something you should have more than one of . i say that , and this is my 2nd old stock within the last 3 hours , so i 'm feeling alright . but about that beer - outstanding new , superfluous aged . i was very excited to try this and glad i picked it up . i would recommend it , unless you go to the same beer stores i do ."

S'bottle now lists the alcohol at 7.8 percent ... pours with a decent head and nice lacing ... smells rather simple for a tripel , its obvious from the beginning that the sugars are very reserved in this brew ... i kind of like this , the intense sugars in most belgian tripels can provide for a wicked hangover.. unfortunately these lack of sugars poses the question , how far has this american tripel strayed from the classic belgian style ? i guess thats up to each person to decide ... subtle fruit/yeast tones present on the palate , alcohol is reserved and not intrusive in any way ... the most drinkable tripel i have had to date , a great entry level choice for the person trying to expand their horizons towards belgian styles ... cheers ! ! !'

S"pours golden yellow , very clear . decent white head at first but does n't last that long . average lacing on the way down . but this pilsner looks fine for a pilsner . a nice smell - citrus , flowers , and a touch of hops . great taste . they knocked it out of the park . it is a mild pilsner . the hops are basically balanced with honey malts . neither really predominates . the right amount of bitterness ; it never gets too bitter like some of my favorite czech pilsners . i think they are deviating from the traditional pilsner style , but in a good way . i guess the only thing that i miss from the traditional style is the extra hoppy kick that goes along with the bitterness . there is n't much of a kick to this beer . on the other hand , the smooth maltiness of this pilsner makes it a lot more drinkable than the czech ones . one of the most drinkable beers around . could have many , many of these . not as complex as other beers i 've ranked this high , but probably one of the best session beers around ."

S"i had a 10 oz . snifter pour of this at the upland brewery on may 1st . this was the first beer i had . it poured a dark brown with ruby highlights when put up to the light . the head was mocha , moderately thick and stuck around for a bit . i get biscuit , earthy hops and vanilla on the nose . it 's actually hard to get alot off of it because the beer was poured rather cold . medium hop bitterness followed by a solid malt presence . the alcohol is well hidden . this is a tasty beer with full flavor . nice starter ! too bad the abv is so high or i 'd have more ."

S"a : poured a nice black body witha tan head that stood 2 1/2 fingers high . the head quickly disipated to 1/2 finger and left nice lacing . s : not a very strong aroma but did have subtle hints of roasted dark malts . t : very sweet . little if any hops bite to it . had a slight coffee after taste . however , the flavor that stood out to me the most was of apples . this beer to me tastes like apples . m : to me this beer was pretty thin for a porter . however , with that being said it also is very crisp feeling which is nice . d : very drinkable . i would suggest this brew to anyone who wants to start exploring the world of porters . it 's sweetier then their american counter-parts ."

S"on tap at the pelican 8-29 bronzed yellow and glowing , with a thin white head . constant stream of carbonation . aroma is a hophead wetdeam - up there with the best of them . hard to know whether to review this as an ipa or a dipa . at 7.5 % and with the amount of hops in here , i 'd say it 's more of a double than a standard ipa . very hop heavy up front , beautiful grassy citrus , that stays with you , finally fading into a puckeringly bitter finish , especially as it warms . excellent mouthfeel - crisp , but full bodied , slightly resinous and sticky , but with enough carbonation to be refreshing at the same time . at first i thought i could drink this all day , but as it warms , the bitterness gets overwhelming , even for someone like me who enjoys abusing my taste buds . in a fairly elite class , the pelican will pull its weight around dreadnaught or ruination . excellent"

S"rusty . looks rusty . minimal head , some lacing . rust i say ! nose is surprisingly earthily hoppy with some citrus and some malty backbone . not as offensive as i thought it would be- always a pleasant finding . taste is n't as great , but nowhere near offensive . lots of breadyness and malts going on . again , more hops than expected- a nice change . i guess some floral-type things too- definitely deeper than i expected . mouthfeel is a bit soapy , oily , not unpleasant . very drinkable on the whole , i 'd say . tasty , simple , goes down easy- a good apa if ever there was one . an easy choice ."

S"pale copper/orange color with a pretty big off-white head that settles down to a fuzzy film with decent lacing . the aroma is sweet cinnamon/nutmeg and pumpkin with some bitter grass . the flavor comes on a bit more bitter than the sweet smell but it holds onto a tastey pumpkin/nutmeg quality . well carbonated and generally a good feel , on the fizzy side as others have mentioned . pretty refreshing , goes down easy but the bitterness and pumpkin flavor may not invite over indulgence here . it definitely puts a little bite on your tongue along the line of a grainy hop . i think it is both different and likeable but i would not be inclined to have more than one of these at a time i think . it 's not stupendous , even as a pumpkin ale , but i must admit that i 've only had one pumpkin ale that i really liked a lot . i would definitely drink this again , especially since i have a six pack with five left ! not bad at all though ."

S'appearance : poured from the 1pt , 6oz bottle into a large mug . the beer is a deep , slightly hazy orange color . you really have to be careful while pouring this one , as the head can get out of control pretty quickly . this head is off-white , rocky , and grew to 3 and a half fingers thick with awesome retention . smell : surprisingly sweet aroma of fresh orange juice and flowers . lemon zest comes in , followed by a light tea note . delicious and fresh all the way through . taste : starts smooth and citrusy with a light creamy character . bready malt comes in to balance , along with light fruits and a general floral character . finishes with a dominating , piney hop wallop that dries everything up , leaving you wanting more . a deceiving , two faced beer that lures you in only to kick your ass and leave you out on the street . just what i look for in an ipa .'

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into my bruery tulip . it poured a murky orange amber color with a very thin white dusting for a head . the aroma is actually pretty light for all the flavors going on in in the taste . it has a sweetness to it with a bit of the lime citrus showing through . i get a bit of a tart , fruity flavor to it as well . i think i get a bit of the graham cracker , but i definitely would n't pick it out if i did n't know it was there . strangely enough it actually does taste a lot like a key lime pie . throughout the flavor i get the lime citrus and the sweet & sugary marshmallow . the graham cracker shows through right up front and then it really makes a comeback lingering after the finish . i get a bit of bitterness to it at times though that does n't seem to fit that well . it feels like a beer that just needs to be extremely sweet , and for the most part it is . i think they hit their target flavor pretty well , however it really just is n't that great of a flavor for beer . the mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being above average . drinkability is n't good , it really did taste like key lime pie but that flavor for me just was n't good in liquid beer form . it was tough to get through half the bottle that i poured for myself . cool concept , but just not a very good beer overall . really like the creative side to this one though ."

S'chilled 1 pint bottle poured to a pilsner glass . once again i have to applaud rogue for offering up another product with a fine looking artwork for the label . nice touch with the mom-like character offering up a tidy microbrew to all and sundry , anyways ... pour a bright golden color with very little if any cloud . gives a strong sense of carbonation as many effervescent bubbles rise rapidly in a race to the join the 2 fingers of loose bubbly head . for an ale that clearly boasts coriander and ginger as its ingredients on the label , the nose of this brew is a little weak . those notes are noticeable but not dominant ( possibly a good thing depending on who you talk to ) , there are indications of soft malts and hops but overall the nose is uneventful . unfortunately , taste is very much inline with the aroma . chewy malt clearly dominates whilst the yeast and saaz hops offer up a very unique blend . herby spice is evident however its hard to say if this is a result of the coriander and ginger or the grainy natural hops . this is admittedly a half take on the weizen style but all i can say is that even half is a bit much for what is delivered . the level of carbonation ended up being far below what i had expected after the initial visual inspection - over all very smooth and light bodied with a bitter taste up front and a dry finish . sadly , this was a mediocre beer at best and whilst its a long way away from being a dog of a brew , its hard to find any glorious features . quarter-e-weizen perhaps ?'

S'at mugs ale house on bedford ave. in brooklyn they had a tasting with a cask of this brew . it was a clear brown color with a average foamy head and limited lace . malt scent with a slight fruity after tone . the beer is very sweet , actually , quite sour . high alcohol content that comes through . i hear that this is better if you sip and savor , but for a first go , it was alright .'

S"it really does n't taste bad . there 's actually a really pronounced cheapo `` american beer '' flavor here that betrays the horrible rumors . still , this beer just is n't good . i bought a forty of it , and thats way too much milwaukee 's best for me , thank you very much . thick , and hard to force down . very filling too for being sheer swill . will i buy it again ? heck , why not . serve very cold ."

S"got the last batch of beers for this beer at my new beer store . best before oct 10 so it is n't what you call fresh poured into a wychwood hobgoblin pint glass with a hedeous looking thing in-front . appearance . beautiful pour of a dark tanned , toffee colour head of 4.5 fingers coupled with a full opaque black body smell : maybe it 's due to it 's freshness , there was some cardboard smell when i opened the cap . due to the head being so thick , not much smell can come through , but as it became warmer , the smell started to appear . so here is what i recorded . there was an explosion of roasted malts and espresso smell coming out . i mean real dark espresso . then , as the drink got warmer , there was a hint of dark chocolate smell , some roasted malts , hops , alcohal and a slight hint of caramel taste : the taste was pretty awesome . lots of complexity to the beer . just like the smell , roasted malts , espresso , hops and chocolate is present . the drink was really dry . there was a sensational bitter aftertaste to it . the only beer i 've tried with a bitter aftertaste was the sa boston lager and this was heaps stronger than the sa . mouthfeel : pretty balanced , there was a bit of carbonation going on . the drink was pretty sour , not sure why , it stays around the mouth a little before going down . drinkability : just like any other stout , pretty heavy . but this is less heavy than guiness or murphys and i was on a pretty full stomach . i would rate it medium body all in all , a very nice stout . nice complexity"

S"poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a rochefort glass . a : gorgeous ! a glowing goldenrod , barely opaque transversely , but mildly translucent from top to bottom . little to no nead or lacing . s : malty-sweet with a crisp nose , alcoholic undertones , and a strange yeasty scent , presumably the `` rare belgian yeast strain that gives a complex spicy flavour and aroma . '' t : good , i suppose . the flavour is complicated , with a mouth-filling maltiness surrounded by a spiciness from the yeast . the label claims `` noticeable hops , '' but i notice them only on the aftertaste , which is a little skunky , funky , and spicy ( maybe cloves ? ) . this strand of yeast weirds me out a little bit ; i do n't quite like the beer . m : murky , muddle , and not entirely pleasant . this ale confuses my mouth . d : i would not drink more than one of these , and i do not want to buy it again . i can not recommend this beer ."

S"ngne - the uncompromising brewery - claims that this is their only compromise : `` norwegians are dead scared of dark beers . this is an attempt to show that there are gentle dark ales . as such havre stout is smooth and drinkable . '' was the compromise a mistake ? no , and i will give my reasons . a : i had this one in a vondel tulip glass , and it truly looks amazing , in a jennifer lopez kind of way . it is clear and black with a brown head , and there are small bobbles along the glass edges . s : there are not very distinct aromas here , but a pleasant sweet maltiness comes through . t : roasted malt which gives a burnt , but not aggressive , aftertaste . the flavor is mild from the oat . no taste of alcohol here , which gives me the impression of a schwarzbier . m : high carbonation . it has a light dryness . smooth and fresh . d : makes you ask for another one . i had this one a little too cold , which partly excuses the low aroma presence , but it may have added to its smoothness and high drinkability . all in all a very good , but slightly boring beer . i can easily see why the brewer considers this a compromise , but it 's a good compromise , and if you want something good that runs down smoothly , this is the choice ."

S'12 oz . undated bottle with a blue and white checkerboard patterened label that has their symbol of fish skeleton with 2 propellers on each end in the middle . when poured into a flying fish pint glass , this oktoberfest was a clear and pale golden amber . on top of this amber brew was a 1/2 an ich head of white foam . this head of foam had decent retention that left behind a small white film and one single blot of white lace . the aroma was plain and simple with toasted malts with a splash of juicy fruits backing it up . the taste was lightly crispy with toasted malts , a tiny touch of juicy fruits , and a subtle hint of crispy floral hops at the finish line . the mouthfeel was light bodied with a crispy aftertaste of toasted malts and a hint of floral hops . in the end , it was stanadrd drinkable session german style oktoberfest beer . you can easily drink 2 of these in a sitting .'

S'this spa ( swedish pale ale ( no i dont know either ) ) was brewed by harviestoun to celebrate the 1500th beer of stockholm beer restaurants oliver twist and akkurat . the colour is deep amber ; the low head is compact and off-white . the smell is quite weak , with a distinct note of lemon-flavoured toffee , coca-cola and some sour notes . the taste is very bitter . there are notes of lemon drops , toffee and bitter-sweet herbs . the aftertaste is milder . there are still lots of bitter herbs ( wormwood ) , but the creamy malt is more present than before . i also found dry notes of oranges and sour candy . the carbonation is very soft and very pleasant . a surprisingly american ale from this fine british brewery , but it is almost as bitter as tonic water thus making it less drinkable .'

S"i have had a lot of beer in my short life -- over one hundred different brews at last count -- and this one is by far the worst . the smell , initial taste , and mouthfeel are comparable to other $ 0.41/can lagers ( that 's $ 5/half-rack ) like schlitz , `` natty ice , '' and the like . what kills this beer is the aftertaste . it hits about two seconds after swallowing and lingers until you can find something to chase it away . it 's a sickly sweet and sour flavour , kind of like spoiled apple juice . if you 're desparate for a dozen beers and only have 5 bucks , do yourself a favor : panhandle an extra dollar and get yourself some pbr or olympia or black label or anything but this ."

S"best before sept '05 on the bottle . i 'm pleased anytime an american brewery crafts their version of a schwarzbier . this one pours a deep mahogany , not quite black . thick foamy head quickly reduces to a thin lace around the glass . nose has some charred malt and hazelnut aromas . imparts some dark chocolate and a nutty peanut buttery flavor balanced by a quick mild hop zing in the finish . love the fact that its sub 5 % -abv ... such an easy drinker , and a true session beer for sure . mouthfeel is a bit acrid and spritzy on the tip of the tongue at first , but graduates to a smoothness in the finish . one i 'd gladly take a few of , and a bit more flavorful than their standard `` lager '' offering ."

S"huge thanks to lurchingbeast for grabbing me some of this on his trip to bell 's and for driving to meet me at my place for the trade ! 12oz bottle from batch 9306 . a : pours a golden yellow color with maybe a little orange tint . a one finger amount of white bubbles forms and settles down to a white rim and small film that laces a little on the way down . s : smells like lots of hoppy citrus , grapefruit and pine . there 's also a good amount of candi sugar type sweet malt in the nose as well . t : very similar to the smell - the hops , citrus , grapefruit and pine are definitely destroying the sweet candi malt in the balance department . the hops and big bitter finish dominate the flavor . m : nicely carbonated with a good amount of bite from the bubbles . very full bodied and palate coating , almost syrupy . d : the flavor is great , but there is just a little too much bitterness in this for me . if that could be toned down - and i 'm thinking maybe just sitting on a bottle for a month or two might do it and this would get bumped up significantly ."

S"2010 12oz bottle poured into a tulip . label is a bit cheesy , but describes itself as a `` sour cherry beer '' & lacks a print of abv . appearance is an incredibly dark red , blood-like color with little head after a delicate pour . smell is of deep dark cherries and some molasses ... perhaps a bit medicinal too . taste is of dessert cherries that are sweet with a tart relief . alcohol burn accompanies the tartness & let 's you know what you 're messing with . the mouthfeel is thin , but with velvety , light carbonation . the finish will make you pucker slightly . enjoyed this one alone , but probably should have split it . i can easily drink all 12oz , but it really does get a bit sweet by the last few ounces . i 'm sure it will age well and it goes down as another great beer by kuhnhenn 's for me ."

S'vintage 2004 . 6.3 ounce bottles . thanks to beerhandy for this treat . in so many ways does this beer remind me of being in porto , portugal . pours a tawny red . essentially flat . yeast at first floats around the glass before mixing in with the beer . aroma simply knocked me off the couch . chocolate dipped raspberries . choclate fondue . strawberries . short cake . fantastic . flavor is more subdued than the aroma . raspberies and chocolate predominate . alcohol is perfectly concealed . also picking out other fruits such as raspberries and cherries . vinuous port wine qualities . lighter body than i imagined . the beer sticks to the tongue and slowly dissolves leaving some slight alcohol heat . i only have one bottle of this ? who wants to send me more ?'

S"reviewing orval is not easy . such a unique and complex beer really needs to be pondered as you drink , it is a beer that really needs respect . so , my review is based on 3 different tastings , all on bottle obviously . one was of a very young one ( 3 months from bottling ) , two had the same bottling date and i drank them in a two week span some 9/10 months after the bottling date , but they were still quite different a- extremely pale and quite hazy orange/amber . head goes up instantly , and it sure goes up , even if you stop pouring . after pouring you 'll have a massive , murky , brown head ( quite unattractive to be honest ) that will show great retention and will leave a lot of lacing on the glass s- sour yeast is what is first to be felt , but there is an awesome amount of underlined aromas : lemon , pepper , orange skin on the sweet side , but there are also some herbal ( probably from hops ) notes and prune . the younger bottle had a fresher and preminently herbal aroma , while the yeast was still there but quite subdued t- suprisingly dry ( though the younger was much less dry and one of the older ones was even too dry in my opinion ) , but still very lively and fresh . hop bitterness instantly kikcs you but ( almost ) never gets arrogant , and then there so much underlined : fruit ( lemon , prunes , citrus ) , herbal tones ( dominant in the younger bottle ) and even liquorice if i 'm not wrong . incredibly complex m- despite being so bitter and dry a pleasant crispness has this beer feeling fresh and mouthfilling . you do n't usually find such good balance in a so complex brew d- i love this beer but i sure ca n't say it is highly drinkable . in your mouth , it is just perfect and incredibly pleaseful , but the aftertaste is so bitter that you would like to stop drinking . it 's some kind of war between your mouth and your throat . mouth wins for me , but i 'm not blaming those who do not love this beer truly a unique beer , and a great one"

S'wow , an amber ale that is precisely amber in color . add a rogue-esque , creamy , off-white head with legs and you have a very pretty beer . aroma is very rogue as well . hoppy up front with a solid bready backbone , but certainly imbalanced toward the humulus camp . the taste is big for an amber , with prodigious , citric bitterness dominating before a smooth , biscuity finish that carries heavily minerally notes . mouthfeel is nice for the style , just a little bit chewy but altogether refreshing . drinkability is awesome , esp . with a sicy meal . another winner from rogue .'

S"appearence : dark but not completely black with just a hint of amber and poured intentially without a head . good for porters . smell : typical porter . a little chocolate , a little coffee . average . mouthfeel : again , typical . foams a little , swallows with a traditional bitter note . drinkability : high ! this beer goes down so easy and quickly , you could drink a 6 quickly before you realized what this 6 costs . taste : as advertised . a good porter with typical notes of most porters with nothing special that leaps out . this would probably be better from the tap . all in all , good porter but not my favorite from the bottle . i 'd buy this if i was thirsty for a darker beer and they did not have any other porters ."

S'white a lovely yellow orange golden color , with a thin white head with a moderate amount of carbonation shooting up form the bottom . no effort to decant this beer leaves a nice density to the body without any issues . citrus and a touch of sour notes with virtually no malt aromas are all i can get from the start . the next smell brings out light sugar which turns the citrus notes to a citrus fruity aroma . this beer takes on a summer beers citrus and fruity flavors with hops that give off a touch of sour but finishes dry and clean . the best triple flavor ive had . just a wonderful citrus flavor . now the flaw of other chimay beers only x10 . this beer is virtually undrinkable with all the carbonation .'

S"`` the beer of belize '' looks good enough : a decently creamy aspirin-white head tops a pale light-gold liquid . the green bottle shows a mayan temple , and lists the brewery 's stout beer percentage along with the lager 's on the back . the head was surprisingly consistent and healthy , small-bubbled and large . the aroma is buttery and sweet , with a good maltiness . the butter note is quite strong , but i did not mind it , because it leads to some butterscotch and candied aromas . other than some balancing hops , there is little else of note in the smell . light malt with a little hop dryness at the end describes the flavour profile . malt predominates in the mouth , and again i get some buttery flavours . the aftertaste is decent enough : fresh graininess , a lack of any adjunct taste , and a hint of dusty hops . mouthfeel is a little watery , but still , the body is medium , and the carbonation is rather low , increasing belikin 's drinkability . not exceptionally rewarding , but this is worth trying at least once ."

S'i remember trying this beer back in college - about 1993 . i poured this brew from a standards 12oz bottle into a pilz glass and observed : a nice refreshing looking beer , light in color and yellow gold at that , head - about 1/2 a finger of fine looking fluffy white head . nose is a bit dull but does have a slight honey tone , or maybe its just psychosomatic . otherwise the hops are subdued and the malt aroma is slight . taste is better than i though it was going to be . the honey notes are well balanced with the rest of the beers characters , mild hops and malts and really hits the spot . body is light and refreshing and the carb level is about right . overall this is good beer and has a high degree of drinkability .'

S"appearance - a thick head and nice body . plenty of lacing left on the glass when i was done . the most impressive beer i 've seen in my short experience of drinking beers . smell - a wonderful hop and citrus blend with something else . pine maybe ? it smells heavenly . taste - this is what kind of kills the beer . i 'm not big on grapefruit and i could n't tell what it was exactly at first that i did n't like it and that was it . i 'm not a fan of grapefruit and using it in a beer is a big no-no in my opinion . but it did n't ruin the beer for me . i still found a lot to like . my gripe is that the grapefruit overpowers everything else in the beer , even the hops . but there was still that nice bite . as long as i kept drinking it i enjoyed it and that does n't mean i had to chug it down either . mouth feel - the beer goes down well . the bubbles dance on your tongue when you first start it but that goes away about 1/2 way through the beer which is disappointing . i 'm not a fan of the after-taste either . drinkability - for a red/amber beer i was expecting it to be a 5 in drinkablity but i find this hard for the average joe to just pick up and enjoy . the 9.2 % alc/vol hits you pretty fast , i am pretty lightweight when it comes to beers i 'll admit but other beers do n't hit me this hard . i was buzzed by the time i finished the one beer . every sip was its own seperate experience which made the whole experience off-setting , not the nice flow i 'm used to when i sit down for a cold beer ."

S"this is unlike any wheat beer i 've ever had before . the four pack of 12oz bottles came labeled in ng 's signature style , but with a red foil wrap at the top ( classy ) . poured a rich amber/orange , thick cloud all the way through , and frothy foamy head with mega-retention and lacing . smell is ripe with piney cascade hops , floral sweetness , clove , and in the background is a little more of the grapefruit citrus , wheat grain , and alcohol . the taste is even more complex and wild than the smell . its almost like an ipa with such bold upfront hops . additionally we get warm toasty malt , yeast , spice , bitter grapefruit peel , followed by sweet bright grain , and a little orange tang . at the end of it all is the high volume of alcohol which ends up being less distracting than you 'd think -- warms everything up and goes down like a cognac or a red wine . as imperial hefe warms up a little it gets quite sweet . its mediumly heavy and a little bit sticky like hoppier ales . so that in addition to high avb makes this is a little much to drink more than one or two . this thing is wild . lots of great flavors going on in here , but it skirts the border of being too much . there just might be a little excess hops on the nose and a little too sweet at the end to be perfect . though wheat beers are what i drink all summer , the other three bottles might stay in the fridge till we get a cooler fall day and i feel like sipping something a little randy . points for creativity ."

S"huge thanks to mikesgroove for this surprising extra . poured from a 12oz . bottle into a sam adams perfect pint . a : gentle pour yields an upward creeping 1 finger coarse , grayish-light brown head with near no retention , dissipating into a group of bubbles atop the brew . beer is a surprising , deep red amber . lacing is stringy and spotty with little cling . s : toffee , caramel , the slightest hint of coffee and ... get this ... pungent sweet and sour cherries and raspberries . to the new glarus guys ... please keep doing what you 're doing and put fruit in everything ! nose is very aromatic and incredibly enticing . t : extremely sour with a cherry tartness upfront . has infection set in ? i think so but the taste seems to match the nose perfectly and all the other reviewers mention this aspect of the beer . toffee , caramel sweetness is barely there in the back . my palate never gets used to the sourness and it ca n't detect anything else . acidic sourness is pervasive . finish is more of the same and the aftertaste just warns me of what 's to come if i take another sip . m : light to medium bodied , coarse , and more carbonated than it should 've been . a bit watery in the mouth and not smooth or oily in the least . finish is messy as is the aftertaste . d : every sip that i had to take to review this beer made me cringe and i usually love new glarus offerings . sourness is way too much here and it does n't mesh well with the classic english porter flavors . skip this . i could n't get paid enough to finish this beer . a complete drain pour ."

S"this is quite an enjoyable brew for a late summer 's night , after having worked all day in the heat . thanks to gcbrewingco for the bottle ( batch # 5 , apparently ) . the beer pours fairly average . it has a light pale golden color that appears amber in the shade . has a light carbonation and a thin and fine white head . looks pretty standard for a belgian pale . the smell is of herbal , spicy noble hops , a yeasty clove scent , and a touch of sweet graininess and light candi sugar . there is a nice herbal flavor to the hops throughout the taste , as well as a bit of the aforementioned yeast/clove flavor . only the slightest bit sweet . perfect , and not over the top on sweet candi sugars like some brewers . it all finishes quite wet with no hint of an aftertaste . mouthfeel is fairly light in body , but still nice and creamy . drinkability is quite exceptional at 5 % abv . the 750 ml bottle is downed quite quickly with minimal buzz . this beer is very highly recommended for a good belgian style lawnmower ale . it is not the most complex and interesting belgian style beer , but it has its time and place . i seem to have found a good time and place in our current nation-wide heat wave ."

S"live review . poured from the 12 oz . brown bottle that i was generously given by my friend bruce ( thanks bruce ! ) into my cooperstown beverage trail pint glass . `` enjoy by feb 12 2011 '' stamped on the left side of the label . a glowing straw yellow translucent body under an all too brief light white head . kind of a standard look for a lager but not displeasing . 3.0 s barley centric smell of a classic lager with an emphasis on corn . again here , somewhat standard and unadenturous . repeated sniffs revealed an even more grainy , pleasing presentation . 3.5 t good tasting lager . sure the barley malt ( not sweet , more grainy ) is primary in the taste but there is also a depth to the barley taste that i do not always find in lagers . 4.0 m rather thin actually . sure lagers are mostly thin but this was really too thin for me . 2.0 d very , very good indeed . 4.5 notes : if it had more body and had a better look and smell i am sure my ratings would have been higher . this is a reasonable alternative to other lagers but i think that there are better ones out there in the craft beer world . thanks again to bruce for seeing to it that i was able to try this one tonight !"

S"green 330ml bottle , stating on the label `` best served with -friends- '' . how nice . guess they had to say that because it would spoil any food it was consumed with . best before oct 2005 . appearance : very pale yellow with little carbonation , head retention and lacing . reminds me of that other classic asian beer , yanjing . smell : fairly repugnant . adjuncts , corn , skunky hops , stuff that should n't be in beer . smells cheap and third-worldly . taste : better than the smell but not by much . skunky hops - these should n't show up in a beer that has n't had to travel far or for very long to get here ( indonesia is australia 's nearest neighbour ) . weird soapy taste , kind of like detergent ... bear in mind i just had a weissbier out of this glass , and did n't use detergent when i rinsed it . corn , i suppose ... nothing really to identify there . not altogether disgusting , but pretty bad . i 've had worse asian yellow macro lagers ( see above ) . mouthfeel : soapy , sticky and thin . nothing redeeming . drinkability : well ... served really cold , when it 's really hot and humid ... in indonesia ... it might pass but otherwise i would n't drink too many of these . this is on a par with regular australian macros but are at the price of a boutique import . notes : this is certainly not a german pilsener ... like none i 've ever had . however , it 's much like a lot of other asian macros , for example 333 from vietnam , yanjing & shanghai from china , taj mahal from india etc . why are these beers all in their own category ? they are like a boutique macro - a classy-looking beer that tastes slightly better than ordinary macro swill , but obviously aimed at the tourist market in asia . mass-produced beer for the rich . amusing proof of this that i just noticed is three gold medals , flanked by wreaths : upon closer inspection , they are not real awards at all ( as if i 'm surprised ) . the three little gold circles say `` monde selection - selection de la qualite '' . if that really is an award , it must have been invented just to give to this beer . yep , strictly for the bali tourist market : it is , after all , `` international quality '' ."

( do n't listen to the beer snobs , it 's okay to garnish a beer ) it states on the bottle `` island style lager '' so that is the style i 'll hold it to and in doing so ... it holds it 's own very well ."

S"why would anyone want to drink a pumpkin beer that does n't have any pumpkin in it ? i do n't often feel moved to review beers that really let me down but i could n't resist digging into this fraud . a : pours a hazy orange color that does n't have much character to it . sort of sits in the glass with a whirlpool of yeast ( ? ) that eventually settles . it strikes me as a poorly filtered beer more than anything , and that shows itself later on in the mouthfeel category . s : pumpkin pie spices on overdrive . the only thing missing from this is actual pumpkin aroma . it sort of smells like , if you 've mixed allspice and nutmeg and cinnamon in a small cup being prepared to be plopped into a batter , and just took a big sniff of that spice cup ... it 's not the most appetizing thing in the world . just a big ball of spice on the nose . oof . i 've had overspiced pumpkin ales ( southampton , i 'm looking at you ! ) before , but never have smelled anything like this . t : all spice and , well ... what is this ? sort of has a buttery character much like a weak offering in the oktoberfest arena , sort of like an autumn-beer frankenstein gone wrong . as a huge lover of pumpkin beers , and frankly , a pumpkin beer apologist - i 'm downright insulted by what i 'm drinking . there 's no pumpkin here ! this is a weak , weak beer with a heavy dose of spices . if you like pumpkin pie spices , the first sip might fool you , but by the end of the experience ... m : you 're overwhelmed by spice . the cinnamon is particularly overdone . i finished this beer feeling thirsty , almost as if i 'd put a teaspoon of cinnamon in my mouth and let it absorb all of my saliva . d : an extremely unpleasant experience , and drinking the entire bottle is a chore . a beer this bad deserves a 1/5 in the drinkability category , because in such splendid company as pumking , night owl , fisherman 's pumpkin stout ... why bother with this ?"

S"i recently had this beer for the first time in about five years . as it usually happens , my memory of how good a beer was differs from how i feel about it now . example , newcastle ... i drank a ton of it in college and thought it was tits , now my palate has changed so much that i think it tastes like swill . red seal ale is a pleasant surprise . it tastes as good as i remember it , if not better . the color is that of glowing copper , capped by a chunky beige head that leaves lacey patchwork as it settles . the aroma is fruity and floral with hints of oranges , peach , and wildflowers along with floral and piney hops a caramel-like malt presence makes itself known with a bitter-sweet toffee smell . the taste starts off with caramel saturated malts perfectly balanced with jasmine flowers , tangerine and pinecone hop bitterness . this is a fresh bottle and the hops are very lively . there is great balance on display here . mouthfeel is medium and smooth , a perfect beer for mass consumption . finishes with a touch of toffee malts quickly overtaken by floral and pine hops bitterness . an excellent beer , it has certainly made it 's way back into my regular rotation of beers ."

S'pours a viscous , oily black with a tall , creamy brown head that sticks around . intense american hops in the aroma . the sharp bitterness and rich flavor of the hops comes through in the palate as well , but it competes with powerful burnt flavors such as bitter coffee and bakers chocolate . creamy mouthfeel with tangy carbonation . a bitter but tasty mixture of hops and burnt flavors . until now , storm king stout was the hoppiest imperial stout that i had tried , but legends imperial stout is hoppier even than most ipas i run across . but , all that aside , its rich and quite delicious . highly recommended .'

S'for me this beer is a blast from the past . stag dissappered from our area about 30 years ago . found it on a recent road trip to the stl mo . area ; just had to buy some and bring it home . i found that it pours with small head of foam that rapidly dissappers . goes down real good and seems be a great thirst quencher ; something that would be great to enjoy after a hot afternoon of yard work or ect . it does have a slight metallic taste that lingers but not unlike that i have experianced in other like beers . would love to try stag in a bottle over-all i enjoyed the case i brought home and look forward to my next trip to stl.mo . i will indeed buy more .'

S"this beer was thrown in as an extra . pours a dark golden color with a reasonable amount of head . the nose is light hops , not much else . an initial sip reveals a mild , balanced barleywine . it tastes of hops and sweetness , but neither overpowering and definitely in balance . lots of barleywines taste like they have thrown the kitchen sink into it , but this is actually subdued and dare i say , highly drinkable for the style . maybe the world 's only sessionable barleywine ( until you fall off your stool ) ? it feels like this beer must have enjoyed some age , as though this is exactly the right time to open it to preserve the hop goodness , but put in harmony with the subdued ( for a barleywine ) sweetness . i do n't know if i lucked into the correct time to drink this or if this is just secretly a killer barleywine , but i highly recommend it . it does have a bit of a lower-key flavor , which i actually think is somewhat impressive in an almost 12 % abv beer , but some might call a bit bland . i think that is a harsh assessment , as my only knock is the very occasional , very slight rubbing-alcohol flavor . surprisingly really good . get it and drink it ."

S"i tried this with my wife tonight . she just fell asleep in my son 's bed while putting him away for the night . she said she loved it , and judging by the snores i think it loved her back . the color of an old walnut table ; not lustrous , but rich mahogany tones . a tan froth quickly dissipated to a milky way in the middle of a foam ringed glass ; a faint sizzle of carbonation just swirling there like a reflection of the big bang in my chalice . a fruit wine nose : fruit blossoms in the distance , dried fruit compote dancing on the vapors of alcohol . cherry chocolate truffle with brandy . quite a lot of fizz , and oak , cabernet , roasted coconut , upside-down pineapple cake with scorched cherries ... mama and papa like this , and mama and papa could drink lots of this in front of the fire place ."

S"750ml bottle purchased at julio 's , westboro , ma . corked and caged . poured in a heavy glass chalice , formed a 3 '' dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew . head slowly fades , leaving tons of rocky lace in its wake . aroma is dark maltiness with lots of bourbon and alcohol , all of which has its corners rounded a bit by the vanilla . taste is a peek of dark sweetness , which is quickly tempered by slightly sour fruitiness . vanilla comes next , with lastin bourbon and alcohol at the close . mouthfeel is way thin , and drinkability is just not that great for me . for $ 19/btl , i expect more ."

S'poured from the can into a pint glass . a really nice dark golden colored body seems to fit perfectly with the style , and an impressive foamy white head gives this beer a nice look in the glass . smell is up front with the c-hops , being a good bit citrusy and floral . a slightly sweet malt presence is detectable but manages to stay in the background . taste is sweet and hoppy . in fact , its just too balanced to be an ipa in my book . while they may use several hop varieties , including dry hopping with amarillo , ahantum , and simcoe , there is just too much of a malt presence . the hop flavors that are available are indeed citrusy and a bit piney/floral , but the malt backbone gets in the way of full hoppiness . a smooth medium body mouthfeel with a good bit of carbonation . overall , a very enjoyable beer , but its hard for me to think of it as an ipa . reviewing to style , i would probably give a better score if this was listed as an apa , were i think the even balance between hops and malt is more appropriate .'

S"a - slightly hazy yellow with a quickly vanishing white head , which manages to cling to the glass a bit on the way down . pretty much what a blonde should be . s - a nice blend of floral and citrus that masks the grainy bombardment to come . t - not robust or strong in any way upfront . most of the flavor is derived from the aftertaste , which is a bit malty with some citrusy notes ( lemon ) , but is mostly grain . it seems the more you drink this beer and as it warms up the grain becomes more dominating . it almost reminds me of malt liquor after a while . m - i really like the mouthfeel of this beer . it is perfectly carbonated and that takes over when it first hits the tongue . it is n't watery or sludgy . it is a really well put together beer in this sense . d - if only they could tone down the grain in the taste a bit , i would really like this beer . i really do n't know if i would enjoy a 6 pack of this in a sitting . it 's a shame because it is otherwise a nice brew . i guess if you like grainy brews this one is for you . also , nice art on the can , very cool ."

S'this beer is a great looking pour . dark , dark brown in color with 1 finger of creamy head that hangs around all day . smells very sweet and creamy , like a milkshake , with subtle hints of roasted malt and malted milk balls . the taste is initially sweet and creamy before fading into a slightly bitter , roasted finish that is slightly lingering . body and balance are good , although the sweetness boarders on excessive and hurts the drinkability a bit . other than than minor complaint , this is a very tasty beer .'

S"served on-tap in my mug club glass at billy o 's english tavern , southington , conn. a : pours a very slightly hazy , chilled pale yellow with a great big solid , two-finger head of dense white foam . the head is rich and creamy , like a guinness . s : smells are faint and malty , a little bit of caramel , banana , and some other fruits . there 's a little dry , hoppy smell , but it 's muted somewhat . t : it 's not a taste explosion , but it 's a good , very easy-drinking blend of sweet toffee malts , slight hop bitterness , and a creamy texture that makes it a great session . m : mouthfeel is thinner than expected from the head , but it 's still fairly creamy and refreshing . d : i think boddington 's is a great session brew , as the abv is very manageable , and it goes down really smooth . though not overwhealming in the taste department , it 's pretty enjoyable . i 've had it out of the nitro-can , and thought it was n't as good , probably just did n't get the right head out of it . it 's nice , mellow , and great for just hanging out and having a few late-night ."

S'pint bottle poured into a snifter . pours opaque black with a single finger of rich light tan head after a hard pour . decent retention and moderate lacings make this one look great in the glass . aroma is of lightly roasted malts and a bit metallic , along with a bit of chocolate and some subtle dark fruit notes . lightly sweet overall with an odd overall character ; possibly a bad bottle due to the metallic character . taste is much better , with a lightly roasted character and a solid black malt presence . the brew is sweet overall with a smooth character and an overall solid profile , though it could be a bit less sweet and more roasted . mouthfeel is decent , though underwhelming . full bodied and rich in texture with a semi-dry finish of residual dark malts . drinkability is good . the brew seems to do all the right things in the wrong way . too sweet , a touch metallic in the nose and not enough roasted malt to sustain the rich and sweet character . hopefully these negative thoughts are from a bad bottle . oh well , that just means another bottle is going to have to make its way in front of this ba .'

S"( from notes ) beautiful , oak color with a lot of red yeast and heavy malts . low carbonation and soft smell , with honey , cherries , raspberry and toffee . alcohol presence is light on the front , but near overwhelming on the back end , like a strong port wine . brown sugar and huge black malty taste prominent all the way through . a touch earthy , but mostly woody and not over-hopped , like many american barley wines . huge flavor . very dense . tons of complexity . difficult to drink in any real quantity , as the alcohol comes through very strong in the end . because of the huge variation among barley wine - style ales and between such ales and american barley wines , i 'm still struggling to figure out how well this fits into the category ."

S'okay , you are probably saying to yourself..why such low marks . believe me , i love hops , that has nothing to do with it . the reason being is that weyerbacher tends to have a problem with carbonation . the six pack i got , 4 of the bottles were way overcarbonated and undrinkable , whereas two of them were fine and quite enjoyable . i felt like going to the brewery , but i would imagine they are aware of the bottling issue by now . just be cautious .'

S"i poured part of a 22 oz . bomber bottle into a goblet and reserved the rest for a bit later as a sort of `` warmer beer '' experiment . it came put a very rich and dark copper color and clear as one would expect from a lager . a very limited bubbly head persisted for less than a minute . not a terribly aromatic brew , but i do detect the high amount of malts and suspect the receipe has a ton of caramel malts in it . the taste is of sweet malt , but in a cloying sweet way . it is there , but overbearing . the hops are but a whisper and it is a nice taste . i honestly expected a bit more of a `` wallop '' with it being an imperial lager . while the carbonation is not readily apparent , you do feel it is the mouthfeel . otherwise , there is a sweetness , but nice mouthcoating effect . sadly this beer is only average when it comes to drinkability simply because of its high abv % . so enjoy one and then you have to watch it ! nice effort though and i am glad that i was able to get my hands on this brew with my trip to colorado . oh and my experiment did not add anything to my review . i was trying to figure out if the nose or taste either improved or declined with a bit of warming ."

S"clarity . glowing , a golden glow , the sea at dusk , the fishies all pottering about their daily lives , and one in particular , a sculpin , of course , a couple-finger-tall white head that floats about and leaves a sticky lacing along the walls as it drifts . can one smell under-water ? there has to be that possibility ... so the aroma , then , a ton of grapefruit , of course , an almost singeing , absurd amount of citric notes , he swims about lazily , caring nothing for the world , and a faint tinge of alcohol . a small amount of sugar seems to balance a bit , but only like a mild sprinkling of white sugar does on the top of a red grapefruit ... so take a bite . mmmm ... and much the same . ruby red grapefruit juice , the whole way down . more flavor than bitterness , some peaches in there as he runs away from a hook . not many bubbles float off of his tail as he swims about , a mild creaminess in the mouthfeel , and he 'll live to swim another day , a lightly bitter finish , but what can you expect for grapefruit juice ? lightly warming in the finish . he can swim like this all of the night , few cares in the world , the love of many , enjoyed by few . here 's to the night ."

S"pours a slightly hazy , pale amber , with a fluffy head . good head retention . aside from appearance , i was pretty unimpressed with this beer . there was very little flavor . it gave me the impression of an american macro lager . i 'll give it a nod for the drinkability and the clean finish , but i really expected more from rogue ."

S"thanks to tanger for this as an extra , cheers jon ! one time brew from around 03/2010 ( from my understanding ) a : pours black and oily . no light penetration . minimal mocha head formation which disappears and leaves nearly nothing . no lacing . really viscous hue sticks to the glass then tilted and slowly resolves back to the beer . s : dark , black , licorice , figs , lots of hops still even after a year . the beer continues to need maturation to me . very in your face with the ris malt profile . ramped up from boris with more licorice , charred oats . t : much more evident oatmeal than the boris , but still very , very malty . alcohol is evident here and creates a sweet anise flavor . the beer has charcoal tones to it . some tobacco flavors , sharp hops and toasted graham . finish is long and toasty . would pair with a maduro cigar quite well . m : thick , sticky , chewy , full bodied with medium-low carbonation . resonates in the mouth . d : drinkable beer . a very nice beer . although i think this would have benefitted from bba ( which i do n't always advise ) and a good year on the shelves in 12oz bottles . that would have made this beer great ."

S"9.99 for a case of 24 bottles . that got my attention , as did the warning on the top of the case - `` enjoy sechs responsibly '' . ha . i like my beer to have sexual innuendos plastered on the case . poured out to a light yellow color with a big bubbly foamy head that was short lived . slight odor of hops and malts were noted . flavor was that of your typical light beer . corn , malt and hops were noted , and this beer had a thirst quenching quality that i have not found in any other beer that you can get for 2.50 a sixer . nothing amazing , but for the price , this brew is very drinkable . good session light beer in it 's truest form . worth a try ."

S"can marked best by feb1411 , served in a tulip glass ( why not ? it 's the only glass i had on me at the time ) pours a slightly yellowed transparent with a large effervescent head -- driven entirely by carbonation , and gone within a few moments . usually my tulip causes any beer to maintain at least a minimal outer ring of head , but with this there was absolutely no head remaining whatsoever . generally even the thinnest beers leave at least a spot or two of lacing , but when this was done the sides of the glass were as spotless as when freshly cleaned . the aroma is reminiscent of soda : nothing but corn sugar sweetness ( if there are any hops in the aroma it is beyond the ability of my nose to detect them ) . the body is absurdly thin and any thickness was from the intense carbonation . the flavor was ever so slightly sweet ... at least it was balanced by an equally slight bitterness . the flavor is utterly unremarkable . i 'd say this was as drinkable as an average adjunct lager ( i may or may not have associated with hipsters and come to tolerate pbr and other such brews for a period of time , there were no witnesses ) , but only by virtue of its taste being so weak as to be somewhat better than overchlorinated city water ."

S'sampled : 11.10.05 appearance is like looking at a glass of cider under a thick brown-white head . moderate lacing . the aroma is immediately of fresh apples . dark wheat hints along with some banana lurk behind that sweetness . heavy scent of candy ( carnival candied apples ? ? ) hangs out through out the drinking experience . the flavor has an initial belgian feel to it , but it dissipates quickly into more sweet candy apples . some grain flavors hangout . the beer also has a tanginess that reminds of cider . this was the first disappointing beer from victory ive had , but its also the first weizenbock ive had . so , i may not be seeking the correct qualities just yet . but one thing for sure is that these bottles were juicy . like apple juice mostly . not very beer like , if im making any sense . the mouth was low carbed and light , like , welljuice . it was easy to drink , but ive only had one per sitting over the last week . as mentioned , my first weizenbock , so tough to compare to it stylistically , but it went down considering the 8 % + abv billing . ==== notes : not my favorite by any means , but it wasnt bad enough to turn me off the beer or the style . ill give another batch a shot and im laying one down to see if the dark malts can gain any footing in this sweet juicy beer and maybe sour the fruit enough for some interesting flavoring . ill report back .'

S"i 'm trying to figure out if these beers are just so progressive i do n't understand them , or if they just taste bad . based on my review , i guess you see where i went with it . a - nice orange colored beer , opaque , with a great two finger foam head that had amazing retention but dissipated unevenly . s - an herbal/woodey/almost cedar type smell wraps the malts up and kind of mixes with some citrusy hops . it 's a bit fruity smelling , almost some pineapple , not bad . t - wow , if there 's such a thing as an oak bomb , this is it . seems a lot more like cedar in some respects , but i feel like i 'm straining my beer through a stick or chewing on when when drinking this . there is a nice pineapple fruit precense , and some very citrusy hops , not very bitter , but this weird wood is too much for me , do n't like it . m - it 's creamy , medium bodied , decent carbonation . d - hard for me to drink due to the taste . i do n't like this beer ."

S"a : ok , the cascading effect and look of this beer ( in the nitro can ) is just awesome , and i 'm pretty sure that has something to do with the popularity of this beer . blackish/red in color , and it 's pretty clear as i can see through it especially when held to a light . creamy off white head with nice retention and lace . it might not be the greatest beer , but it sure looks great . 3/5 s : mild strength . smells macro-lagerish , but with some hints of roast and caramel notes . 3/5 t : watery . yes , i said it . mild taste but some hints of roasted caramel , coffee , and chocolate . i imagine this was once much bolder ( and awesome ) , but now it 's been dumbed down to compete with the lites of the world ; some hints remain of what was once a great civilization ! barry 's tea , at least , has n't been hit by the light american craze . 3/5 m : thin and watery , though excessively smooth and creamy with the retention in the head . 3/5 d : yes . the calories and smoothness are right ; it does n't sit heavy , and it 's easy and unoffending to drink . 4/5 overall impression : as i said before , it seems to be the remnants of what was once a great civilization . there 's hints of what it was and the look is just amazing , but there 's better stouts out there . the commercials a few years back did n't hurt either . i 'd love to try original recipe guinness to see what this could be ."

S"saw this beer tonight at the grocery store and thought ab had struck the gold mine . this product struck me as something i absolutely had to try . $ 4.59 for 4 10oz cans , i brought them home and dug in . i drank these directly from the can , but i will say they tasted terribly flat . hardly any beer flavor is evident , as raspberry and citrus scents overpower whatever actual alcohol is present . honestly , i was left wondering if this product actually contains any alcohol at all . since the packaging yields no information on the product , i decided to conduct an experiment , and drink all four of my 10oz bes in a 10 minute period . i will say that this product is extremely drinkable , but i am still looking for the alcohol content . i have read that it is supposed to contain 6.6 % abv . i seriously doubt this claim . this would be an excellent brew for women as it seems to have a very low alcohol content , and not as much sugar as the popular wine and vodka coolers . i do credit budweiser with an innovative product , but i sure wish they 'd make one with a little more beer in it !"

S'pours a brilliantly clear pale straw color with a fluffy white head that leaves lots of lacing . great saaz nose of flowers , honey , just a touch of spice and biscuit . dry , crisp body with plenty of carbonation . austere and brisk , with a full but delicate hop flavor that leaves an almost green tea-like bitterness . just a touch of dms creeps into the aftertaste . a stand out classic pils . yum !'

S"a - yellow marigold pilsener or kolsch appearance with a faint green cast . a tiny cap tops this seemingly harmless brew . s - smells like those pepperocinis that you get with papa john 's pizza . almost like a pickled pepper . definitely green peppers ... like cholula green pepper sauce . there are also some vinegar notes , but no real underlying beer smells . t - not as hot as i thought it would be . this is nice and spicey , but not nuclear-hot like dave 's cave creek chili beer . i like the flavor of hot stuff , but ca n't handle anything more than half-way up the buffalo wildwing 's wing-sauce menu , and this did n't set off any fire alarms in my sensitive gut either . pretty good if you take it slow ... big gulps can clear your sinuses . m - just feels hot more than anything . medium bodied , prickly carbonation , and some mildly painful heat . d - actually pretty damn good . i thought that i would hate it , and it 's not something that i would really buy again , but i 'm glad that i gave it a shot . this is actually a drinkable chili beer !"

S"pours a hazy reddish orange with an off white head that quickly recedes to a ring around the edges of the glass andd a patchy film on top of the beer . aroma is of sweet malts and citrusy ( grapefruit ? ) hops . lots of complexity in the aroma , this smells great ! it pretty much tastes how it smells , but the alcohol is very noticeable . the bitterness is a bit unpleasant in the finish though . full bodied , carbonation seems lite . this would n't make a good session beer , but its a good one to sip . i 'm guessing this will probably be better with a few months of ageing with the alcohol bite and hops mellowing ."

S"12oz brown bottle . first time i 've seen this on the shelves and was surprised that a pale ale from brazil made it to my local haunt . its got a lively appearance with racing carbonation supporting a pillowy white head . bright golden body . very spritzy and punchy on the palate . a good layer of hops and malt collide in a rough way . slightly metallic and clashes with with the already troubled meat of this beer . tastes a bit hot and lagerish . some cooked vegetables and raw grain lingers . notes : a unique beer that stands out . i will not forget this flavor and i 'm pretty sure i could pick this one out of a blind tasting . pass on this one ."

S"on tap at collins pub today . the beer pours an impressive hazy orange color with pretty good head retention and lacing . on the nose ... sigh ... . ok , another over the top sour beer . i get a blast of sour , along with some ice tea and apple vinegar . i can tell already this beer is going to put a hurting on my palate . on the palate , i 'm sorry ... . the predominate flavors are sour , sour and more sour . maybe there is also a hint of gin , orange and lime , but the sour funk is just blowing me away . mouthfeel is light to medium bodied , and i assume the alcohol is pretty low . as for drinkability , this beer is as drinkable as a blow torch . the sour component just puts my hair on edge . thank god for the lovely glass of anacortes ipa i have to wash it away with . this reminds me somewhat of the isabelle proximus , except it 's not as complex and is even more sour ( imho ) . if you like the isabelle , you 'll probably like this as well . as for me , what can i say ? i keep on trying , but with beers like this , it 's very slow going . note : there are some fruit flies in the pub today , and they 've been hovering around my beers . strangely , they 're not the least bit interested in my ipa , but just ca n't get enough of the love . i 'll leave it to others to speculate just why that may be ."

S"i really think they should have to tell you if the `` oaken barrels '' they use had whiskey or bourbon in them first . only because thats all i could smell , and all i could taste . when i purchase a beer , generally , i 'd like that beer to taste like beer . not hard liquor . this is one of those for people who can appreciate bourbon-esque like beers . reminds me alot of goose island bourbon county stout . which i also found dreadful . poured from a 22 oz bottle . the look was pretty much what i expected , dark and almost inviting . the smell made me cringe , straight bourbon-whiskey-alcohol . then the taste . i just plain do n't like whiskey , and this is all i tasted . for what it is , the mouthfeel was the only thing this has going for it . light for the ammount of alcohol , and if i liked it , i could sip it all night long . drinkability is pretty much a 0 . but it only goes down to 1 . says on the bottle that this is new hollands `` crown jewel '' ... . well , give me those rocks and stones over there please ."

S"i can't believe what they will put into a can and call it `` beer '' ! the can reads `` beer with the natural flavor of raspberry ; beer with something extra ; 6.6 % alc./vol . '' and yet along the top of the can , it reads `` contains alcohol '' ! so all of the other labeling was not enough ? ! ? wtf , over ? the canquest rolls along ... i got a nice two fingers ' worth of rocky , bone-white head with low retention off of the pour . raspberry ? more like raspberry perfume . i could smell it immediately and it was an obvious case of better living through chemistry - no raspberries were harmed in the production of this beer . color was a golden-yellow with ne-quality clarity . it brightened this otherwise dull , snowy afternoon , allowing me to write something positive . mouthfeel was abrasive on the tongue , thanks to both its carbonation and the candy-like flavor imparted by something extra . gadzooks , but the taste was awful ! it was reminiscent of razzles candy from when i was a kid , but at 6.6 abv , it was not candy . the finish left me with a regret so profound that i can not put it into words . this is definitely one to be avoided ."

S"this is a bit darker than the honey wheat , and i 'm guessing that the raspberry has something to do with it . there 's a strong fresh raspberry smell in the aroma , but nothing else . the wheat flavor is still there from the honey wheat , but is muted by the berries . the berry flavor lingers into the finish ."

S"poured from a bottle into a tulip . reddish/pink lemonade pour . not much going on in the foam or lacing departments . smells like a raspberry kids drink , but highly alcoholic . like a boozy juice box . sign me up . flavor is pretty much along those same lines . smooth , sweet raspberries , with a hot , somewhat numbing finish . booze is very apparent , though i would n't have guessed 18 % . smooth , syrupy texture . leaves a light tickle in the back of the throat . hard to drink more than about four ounces of this one , but it 's still enjoyable . i was pleasantly surprised that this was a fairly simple ( well , as simple as an 18 % raspberry beer can be ) dogfish head offering ... i was expecting something much more , off-center i guess , but that was not the case ."

S"well , i went down to see what was new on the shelf since the laws have changed in nc . i ended up gettting two new beers that i have n't tried yet . this one is my first lambic which has always been there but never tried it . it 's a little different to what i am used to but intresting try for me . hey this bottle has a cork . glad i had a corkscrew laying around or i would n't be happy . the pour was shocking seeing that it came out purple and fizzy . it does mention that raspberries are added to the mixed . the person that told me about the style said it would be strong and it is with the aroma that comes to you instead of you going to it . honestly , i think this is more in the wine caterogy than a beer . but i am learning right now . i would n't buy this again but i would recommend it for the experience of it . i hope to find a lambic that i like to cal my own ."

S"bomber split with a friend , poured into a pilsner glass . the bottle shows that it 's 100 ibu and 9 % abv . a - bright yellow and gold blended body has good clarity , but an oiliness from the hops and alcohol . white head forms thick , and fades to a nice ring leaving good lacing behind . s - clean , with citrus hops and fresh cracker maltiness . alcohol is also noted here as it begins to warm . t - holy hoppy pilsner batman ! ! the 100 ibu 's is no joke . this is an ipa of an ip ! ! great upfront bitterness is an attention grabber , but does n't destroy the tongue . big malt backbone is just enough to showcase the cascade and sterling hops . m - medium body , the alcohol warms the back of the throat on the way down , but not hot . d - the 9 % abv is very well hidden here , and you may find yourself thinking you can have a few of these , but the truth is you will be shmammered if you try it ."

S"ahhh , i picked up a sixer of this guy at trader joe 's , i figured that while the range of vienna lagers is pretty great , they are all pretty good . this beer continues that tradition by being good , not great , but good . this beer pours like beer is supposed to . man , a nice red gold beer with nice little bubbles popping up creating a nice bubbly off-white head . the off-white head dies all too quickly , but it was nice while it lasted ! the beer 's taste and smell is pretty good . it feels , to me , like an americanized version of the mexican take on vienna lagers . quite the bouncing around there , but it is true . there are a lot of really good malts going on here , the nice clean bite of vienna malts . mostly pils-y , but with just a *bit* of toffee in there . but there is also a strong corny/vegital presence . in the mexican versions of the style , that would be due to the use of adjuncts , but in this case i am fairly convinced that it is good ol ' fashioned dms from improper brewing techniques . beers like rolling rock have perfected this slightly-defective taste that encourages quick drinking because it only becomes problematic in the aftertaste . keep drinking without stopping , and you wo n't have a problem ! so , yeah , a nice quaffable beer with a good malt presence . at less than a buck a beer , i ca n't complain , but i can get better beers for that price . i grabbed a single of their weizen while i was at the store , and i am wishing that i had bought a sixer of the weizens and a single of the vienna . but i 'm not unhappy with the sixer of vienna -- and i rarely buy beers by the sixpack . so , take that as you will ."

S"well this one was quite a suprise . i 'm not the biggest fan of this brewery , all of my beer buddies know that by now . i understand why many people like them though , and they are a solid brewery who do produce some very good brews on ocassion . anyways , i 've liked all of their `` oaked '' brews very much so far . heresy was killer , and insanity was awesome as well . than again , i really like those base beers as well , and i 'm not a big fan of merry monks . it always came across as cloyingly sweet to me , and this brew is similar to that . anyway . prophecy is a beautiful looking brew . a deep dark golden colour with a huge head of off-white foam that lasts and leaves excellent lacing . retention is great as well . however the aroma is scary to me . it 's totally one-dimensional sweet hot alcohol and oak . thaat 's about it . taste floows suit with super sweet belgian malts which are cloying and again a super sweet hot alcoholic oak flavor , with maybe a hint of vanilla in it as well . this is just way too sweet and oaky for me , instead of mellowing this harsh brew out , it just increased the harshness ! mouthfeel is good , slick and medium bodied , but drinkability is rough as this one just did n't do it for me at all ! not too good , but hey worth a shot ..."

S"a : pours into a goblet , the exact color of apple juice . the beer itself is crystal clear , but there are chunks of a bizarre fleshy bits in the beer . i suppose that means this bottle is either the first or last of the tank , since a quick scan of other reviews indicates that this is n't the norm . i 've also seen this in dogfish head 's red and white . kinda makes me question the brewery 's qc , but moving on ... white head that quickly vanishes . s : sweet , apricot , with honey and clove from the malts , and a pinelike spice . apple . surprisingly , raspberry is low on the list of fruit scents in this beer . t : reminiscent of champagne - crisp and tart . more piney and bitter than i would have expected . some sourness from the raspberries , but they come through with an acidic tartness more than a fruitiness . m : light , with a biting carbonation . d : low . what the hell is this beer ? it does n't look or taste like a wheat , but more like a raspberry champagne . not good ."

S"bottle into erdinger pint glass in low altitude galway , ireland . very excited for this brew , though it cost me around 8 euro for the bottle . a : pours a beautiful tan head with lots of cream and brilliant retention . there 's a lovely bubble show to feast thin eyes on wile you wait for the opportunity to try it . i ca n't wait to try this beer . sm : smells strongly of alcohol , oak , and almost bourbon . very musty . hard to smell past the alcohol for any usual stout notes , but i plan to find out in the taste . a very appealing scent . t : as i prepare to taste it ( after five minutes ) , the head is still a solid two fingers . impressive for this high an abv . a complex body . the oak comes through and carries strong through the finish . the cranberry taste is very subtle to the point that i would n't taste it if i were n't searching for it . as for the jasmine , what the hell does that taste like ? i 'm usually disappointed with brewdog , especially for how much their beers cost , but this beer is the first exception . it 's brilliantly complex yet still refined . here is a worthy oak aged stout . mf : it 's as heavy as it needs to be to carry the taste , while still smooth . it is far too syrupy , however . almost a bit slimy . dr : at this price , i wo n't have it again unless an occasion arises that warrants it . it 's a good beer , but i 'd have to have stateside prices to justify purchasing it a second time , especially when there are other barrel or oak aged stouts i prefer . all in all , it 's well done , but expensive ( this may summarize the opinion most have towards brewdog in general ) ."

S"retro green 12 oz . can that 's decorated with small yellow daisies and a small goat dancing with a daisy in its mouth . on the bottom of the can is some kind of brewery code . it sure is n't any best before date . when poured into a stoudt 's pint glass , this bock beer is a clear dark copper amber with a decent 1/2 inch head of fizzy white foam . this head of foam quickly fizzled away into a handful of bubbly rings along the edge and single spot of lace . i was surprised to see that the color of this beer was so good . the aroma was grainy , but not a bad macro grainy aroma . yeah the grainy aroma consisted of corn and rice , but it was n't all that bad . behind the grains was a subtle touch of apple juice and a small dash of cinnamon . the only way i can describe the beer is that it is grainy with malt , corn , and rice , but it was a good grainy taste . the grains were n't overly sweet . they were just right for this beer after the grains is where it got interesting . did my taste buds find chocolate or coffee ? nope ! they instead found a few spices like cinnamon and nutmeg . very interesting and unique bock taste . this is a light bodied beer with a lightly sweet grainy aftertaste of malted grains and a dash of cinnamon . i honestly thought this bock was going to be watery , but it was n't at all . there was n't any taste of water anywhere in this beer . not a bad beer at all ! this beer surprised me a little . i knew it was probably going to be grainy , but what got me was that it was a good grainy taste . i would n't mind having another one of these real soon ."

S'i purchased two .5l bottles of this for 3.50usd each , and drank it from a weizen glass . the appearance is lovely , very dark with a ruby tint to it , and a big , fluffy , off-white head much like many other german wheat beers . the carbonation is very evident when you look at the beer . it smells wonderful , big , malty , fruity , and full of yeast . similarly the taste is malty and yeasty , with heavily fruity and clovelike flavors in addition to the yeast and malt . there is little hop presence , but that is not a drawback in this case . the mouthfeel is good , but a tad overcarbonated at times , and rather viscous in spite of that fact . likewise the drinkability is less than that of some beers , due largely to the thick , sweet , malty character of this brew as well as the higher than average alcohol content . excellent for a cool-weather wheat beer , a celebratory treat , or just whenever for lovers of big malty beers , this is one of my all time favorite german beers and one i often share with friends just beginning to discover the world of fine beers . always good , when served at just the right time this beer is incredible !'

S"gubna imperial ipa pours a clear vibrant golden color with a thin off white head . smell is initially very sweet , with strong hop notes of citrus , like tangerine or grapefruit . i can get subtle notes of the 'fried onion ' smell/taste that i have read , but it 's mostly fruity . taste is much of the same , with a very strong citrus hop bite and mango followed by the armpit-sweat like onion taste of the summit hops . im personally a fan of summit hops , though , so it 's all good . there is a good amount of bitterness , though it 's subtle , and not at all harsh . there is a strong malty sweetness that almost competes with the mango hops and creates a very strange 'sour ' beer . mouthfeel is good . remarkably sippable for a 10 % beer . while i love summit hops , the gubna is n't my favorite , and at the same price as ten-fidy , it 's really not worth it for me to keep buying these . definitely props to ob for what they 're doing , though ."

S'pours a light amber , strong banana haze . great two finger head that slowly recedes to a very thic foam throughout the whole 12 ounces . concentric lacing and strong bubbling . the aroma is full of cloves and bananas with just a touch of bubblegum . the taste has notes of bananas , cloves , and lightly toasted malts with a little hard water like bitterness a the finish . the palate is sweet , smooth , but a little to minerally for my taste . still , not bad though . pretty easy to drink all year round .'

S"appearance : hazy light blonde color . it reminds me of an unfiltered beer . head forms fuzzy and full . there 's not much head retention , unfortunately . smell : smells lemony and a bit grassy maybe ? floral is probably the better word for it . at first glance it reminds me of a zesty , belgian wheat . taste : interesting . it has a very light taste to it . the finish is slightly bitter and leaves a little skunky taste in the back of my mouth . i get just the slightest lemon zest on the front end . i 'm not a huge fan of dead guy and i 'm not a huge fan of this . that being said , i give rogue huuuge bonus points for taking a new , inventive and daring twist on barrel aging . who ages beer in gin barrels ? mouthfeel : mild and medium bodied . a little light . i do n't know if its the hops but the bittering on the end makes my mouth curl and not in a terribly pleasant one . drinkability : good , meh ."

S"16 oz can , undated poured into a pint glass a - pours very thick . looks very solid . lots of haze and color in this thing . a very dark color , with a shade of red similar to the can . carbonation shows soldily throughout the pour , with a small head remaining . s - oh boy the hops hit hard on this one . very citrusy and grapefruity type smell leads the way here . almost has a wet hop character to it . t - starts with the sharp bitterness , which then transitions slowly to the citrus notes followed up with a malty backbone . the end seems more sweet , but that could be the hops fooling my tongue . m - like the look , it feels thick on the tongue . very solid . makes it feel a bit filling down below . d - it rolls easy from drink to drink , but not something i can slam . i like the flavor , but the hops might become tiresome before a session is over . good beer - i do like it . reminds me of mojo from boulder . mn folks may call this blasphemy , but i 'm not extremely enamored , and therefore would n't seek it out very often ."

S"i imbibed this specific guinness in an irish pub overlooking the baltimore harbor . i had read somewhere that stouts go well with raw oysters so , seeing as i was on the harbor , in baltomore , and already drinking a guinness , i thought i 'd give the guinness/oyster combo a shot . poured from a nitro tap , the legendary guinness head formed as the falling tan foam settled . the head is extraordinarily thick and creamy in appearance , texture , and taste . i had to push through the head to get to the black richness beneath and found the familiar roasted goodness . at 4.2 % , it is easy to drink . one would expect a heavier beer , given the color , but this is one great sessioner . aroma was clean and slightly toasty . the guinness draught is simple and good , much lighter in flavor than other stouts . i do n't know if it 's comparatively light stout flavor complemented the oysters or if they oysters would have paired better with a richer , roastier , stout-ier stout . i do know that i could have easily had another couple of these with a couple dozen oysters had i had the time to do it ."

S"appearance : mostly golden and a bit brown . no carbonation . some particles floating around as well . smell : i actually love the smell of this . lots of oregano and tomatoes , and the beer itself gives a nice yeasty pizza dough aroma . taste/mouthfeel : definitely pizza . in honestly , it 's not that bad at first . pizza beer goes too far with the tomato . beer on its own is quite acidic , but the tomato gives this an unbearable sourness and acidic aftertaste . as far as the feel , it 's fairly watery and uninspiring . drinkability : the sourness makes this hard to swallow . overall : a nice try at a novelty beer , but it misses the mark . i would definitely use this when making pizza dough in lieu of water ."

S'22oz . bottle poured into a snifter . no bottled date found . ( a ) - pours thick & dark black as the darkest night . produced a good fluffy tan head that dissipated rather quickly . ( s ) - a deep/rich roastedness with chocolate & molasses . a touch of dry woodiness . a spiciness that might be nutmeg or something . ( t ) - just like the smell . a very dense roasted wood component that is borderline burnt . almost chalky on the finish . ( m ) - a good carbonation level . rather hot in the alcohol department . a nice roasted profile , but it is really boozy , almost killing off most of the flavor this has to offer if it were not so burnt tasting . ( d ) - an interesting beer that is ridiculously full-bodied and potent . could age for a long time considering how it currently tastes . in my opinion it needs tons of time to age in order to smooth out its edges . not bad though .'

S"the notion of a belgian ipa is a happy little combination of seductive styles . the use of hops in this guy works very , very well with typical belgian pale ale characteristics . the hops bite and the belgian smooth is very appealing . allagash does a very good job of walking the fine line of merging styles . this resembles an ipa more than it does a belgian pale ale as hops are on the aggressive side but the finish is more ... yeasty and subtle . one particularly noteworthy point is that this is pretty easy to guzzle for something that is 8.5 % strong . allagash has n't always delivered for me in the past but this guy is something i would like to revisit ."

S"a - this clear golden brew comes in a glass bottle that could cause serious skunkage , and throws up a fizzy and short lived bone white head . no real lace to speak of , but head retention is slightly better than other pale lagers . s - corn tortillas with salt . cornbread malt profile with a very light peppery hop note . this does a better job approximating a real pilsener than some other macro `` pilseners , '' but it still smells like loads of adjucts . t - biscuity and peppery . very much in the vein of a lighter german pils . i 'm really surprised by how different this is from what i was expecting . i thought that this would be another mexican , bahamian , macro beach beer but this shows a bit more character than others . it 's still pretty light and corny , but it does have some saaz hop characteristics and a nice firm bicsuity malt backbone . m - light bodied and highly carbonated . the finish is pretty sweet , and that kills the whole german pils vibe that this beer almost has going for it . d - this is a step above typical beach party clear golden lagers , but it 's really nothing special . i would gladly drink a few of these corona killers on a scorching day at the beach , but i probably would n't buy this intentionally . this sample was kindly provided to me by the husband of a lady that i work with ... i have a reputation at work as `` the beer guy , '' and he graciously sent one of these to work with his wife for me to try ( at home of course ) ."

S"picked this up from my local beer store having never heard of the brew before . great presentation with a picasso-esque picture on the front of the bottle . poured into a 3f half litre glass and shared with a friend . appearance is quite nice with tones of opaque amber with very citrusy hues as well . hues are reminiscent of peaches and the one inch head is an off-white/eggshell color . viscosity is decent but not as clingy as i would like a dipa to be . nose is a great citrus-based dipa . grapefruit and nectarines penetrate the nostrils . a little malt comes through but the thought of sugar-covered grapefruit for breakfast comes to mind when thinking of the aroma with just a hint of candy : perhaps the smell of grape nerds candy . taste hits heavy with sweets , warming alcohol , grapefruit , tangerine , nectarine and a sweet milk like taste . it 's such a strong and different taste that i almost want to dislike it but i ca n't ... candy sugar taste but not so over-powering that the malts do n't come through . the brew is a bit off-balanced for the style with it leaning towards the hops : heavy , but super-sweet flavors , bring out the actual flavors and the aroma of the hops so much that i just do n't want to mark down for it . mouthfeel is great and almost feels reminiscent of drinking apricot juice . medium body and clean without deep or unpleasant hop bitterness . i would definitely be up for trying this beer again . sessionability is low due to high abv and it 's unique flavor . a good brew , all in all , but so different you 'll be left wondering what exactly you were drinking ... in a good way ."

S'600 ml bottle aroma - typical skunky lager aroma . no noticeable hop aromas . appearance - clear yellow big white head but just a trickle of carbonation . taste - watery with a dry finish . not really any detectable hops but not overly sweet either . notes - the bottle came in a plastic cloth like cover that was nicely tied around the neck of the bottle and had chinese writing on it . they should have invested more in the beer flavor and less about what the packaging looked like .'

S"appearance- bright gold . thin white head . smell- like freshly baked cookies . not kidding . its easily the most appealing beer i have ever smelled . taste- there 's a lot going on here , and all of it familiar , which only adds to its appeal . as has been stated by just about every other reviewer , all the elements of pumpkin pie are present and accounted for : cooked pumpkin , pie crust , nutmeg , allspice , cane sugar , melted vanilla ice cream , cognac , and a slightly bitter finish reminiscent of that mug of hot coffee that goes so perfectly with the real dessert . quite balanced , unlike so many other pumpkin beers . by far the closest thing i have ever encountered to pie in a bottle . mouthfeel- perfect . drinkability- alcohol ( 9 % ) is detectable but well-masked . and just like any good pumpkin pie , it will fill you up . as much as i enjoyed it i struggled to finish the bottle . once a year will suffice , but worth indulging with all the same ."

S"poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass ( topped off twice before finished ) . served at 60 degrees . appearance - really good looking copper color with a tan , 2-finger foamy head that dissipates and leaves moderate lacing down the glass . smell - slight floral hop smell and sweet malt . do n't smell too much in this beer . taste - knocks you on your ass from the first sip . huge hop bitterness , but fairly balanced with malt sweetness . starts off very sweet and the bitterness comes in alongside the alcohol . mouthfeel - fair amount of carbonation . feels very , very heavy in the mouth . hop bitterness stays in your mouth until the next time you brush your teeth . the alcohol can be felt as well , there 's no hiding the 7.4 abv in this brew . drinkability - took me nearly 90 minutes to drink the 22oz bomber and there will be no more imbibing for me tonight . definitely something you 'll want to set aside some time to drink . overall , something i will definitely buy again . it 's a bit pricey but worth it for those occasions where you want a very strong brew ."

S"had on-tap at barley 's in greenville , sc . served in a shaker pint glass . a -- deep ruby highlights toward the bottom keep the body from being black , which is on point . it 's the head i had issues with -- almost two fingers of light , cottony white foam . looks like a homebrew , an amateur homebrew . liquid yeast ? s -- the best part , i felt . pretty rich and bitter , with coffee and chocolate . a lighter chocolate smell , maybe due to the addition of oats -- -kind of sweetened it , though not like the toffee notes you get in a traditional oatmeal stout . t -- enh . decent , but not outstanding . just ok. standard bitterness and definitely mellowed out by the oatmeal , but nowhere near big enough in the flavor dept . for the abv . not /bad/ by any means , just not very interesting , either . and in this style americans are doing lots of interesting things . m & d -- mouthfeel 's fine , though a touch watery . drinkability , again , is not that high for me because if you 're going to get near six percent you got ta pack more of a whallop . either that or or tone down the abv so i can throw back a few of these without feeling it . would make a fine session ale in that case , but right now there 's just too much bite in that dog -- and not enough teeth ."

S'paid $ 5.99 for a bomber and poured into a pint glass to review . nice white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving behind a thin sheet of retention . much rising carbonation bubbles from the bottom of the glass . very cloudy straw yellow in color . nice lacing . aroma is of grain/wheat , citrusy/grassy hops , toasted malts . rather mild aroma for this being just under 9 % . taste is lemon citrus up front with a decent amount of sweetness coming from the balancing malts . dank citrus hops that remind me a bit of freshly cut grass . much more full flavored than my nose suggested . medium body , good carbonation , relatively thick and creamy . not a bad beer , but certainly not my favorite style . the grainy and citrus taste gets a bit overwhelming to me as i near the bottom of the bomber . as it warms more , this taste takes on an unpleasant soapy character and becomes a drainpour .'

S'reviewed from notes . pours black with a slight mocha head . the nose is really quite extreme -- even for this series -- as it brings forward loads of sweet cream and vanilla along with burnt sugar . in the back are some roasted malts , coffee , and light chocolate flavors . the taste really brings the sweetness forward and it gets to be quite cloying . the mouthfeel is rather thick and a bit of an alcohol burn sets in toward the end . i would really have a difficult time drinking more than 4oz . or so of this , though the nose is incredible .'

S"the appearance is yellow straw with a fizzy head that quickly vanishes . the smell is sweet and sour at once , but both qualities are indistinct enough to blend into something unappealing . taste is actually pretty good -- something like a sweet coconut , followed by a bitter finish . as it warms , the coconut turns into a honey sweet , reminiscent of a less intense honey lager . mouthfeel is unimpressive and average , somewhat watery . the carbonation seems less than usual , but manages to tickle the tongue . here comes the ultimate negative -- after one of these , you begin to build up a high level of gas that you just ca n't seem to get rid of . it sits in the middle of your chest and refuses to go away . i asked some friends if they were experiencing the same -- and they were . the bloat factor is high , but the beer tastes pretty decent . better than i expected , but not good enough to warrant another purchase ."

S'reviewing this one based on the second time trying it , as the first time i had it , i had barely started trying craft beers and had no point of reference . beer pours jet black with and surprisingly has a decent amout of head . can already tell this is a serious beer . the smell is rich malt , with a hint of burboun . the taste is very complex . starts with sweet complex malt maybe a hint of dark chocolate , and finishes with a sweet then warming bourbon flavor . the mouthfeel is thick but smooth , no issues here . the drinkability is a bit of an issue , as the bourbon taste and booziness can start to get to you after a few sips . overall an exellent beer though .'

S"purchased as a six pack from avalon liquors on friday , with none left by sunday . nice labeling with the sun rising off a farmhouse scene . no best before date , but some sort of lot code ink jetted on the back label . pours a hazy pale yellow -- just like a nice hot/hazy/humid summer sunrise -- with a fluffy white head . excellent retention and lacing . faint citrus notes -- predominantly banana rinds and some oranges -- with a large amount of clove . hmm . very light mouthfeel to the brew with a zestiness from the carbonation and citrus . became the best and worst properties . some medicinal/clovey yeast phenols finish off the flavor . the finish itself is rather clean . it 's a nicely balanced combination that expresses the yeasty esters of a weizen but does n't hammer them home . no real bitterness to speak of . sweet malt rides along throughout the tongue ride . very drinkable summertime brew . if only the citrus/banana notes were turned up , and the cloves turned down , this one would be outstanding . enjoyed on the boat , with dinner , and just sitting around . actually used one on sunday as the sun rose over the atlantic and we travelled out fishing . severly hungover , i attempted the `` shampoo effect .

S"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a draft glass . a : poured a clean , straw colored body with a 1.5 finger , white head - looks like what you would expect form a pilsner . head dissipates after about a minute . lacing is light , leaving thin , patchy rings of bubbles around the glass . s : it 's definitely got some of the `` skunk '' going on - something i 've noticed with most euro lagers . it also has that similar , faintly sweet , grainy note like you get from an american adjunct lager . maybe a hint of hops ? i 'm not entirely sure if i 'm getting its presence , but others assure me that it 's there . otherwise , there is n't a lot going on in the nose . t : crisp , quite clean profile . there is a slight second of bitterness upfront which gives away as the clean malt profile takes over with a faint sweetness and a touch of grains and husks . finish is slightly dry , but otherwise pretty smooth and un-offensive to the palate . m : fizzy ; good carbonation on the tongue . very light bodied ; maybe a tad watery but not overly thin . d : if you 're going to session euro lagers , this might be a good choice ... not hard to drink for the style . carlsberg , along with newcastle , guinness , stella and heineken/amstel light will always be nostalgic for me because these beers were my first steps towards drinking better beer . while none of these beers may be remarkable in their own right , they were a part of that step that opened my eyes to new flavors and styles and opened the floodgates into craft beers . as such , i do enjoy a carlsberg from time to time , usually when i frequent local pizza parlors , and it is a crisp , clean stand-by pilsner in my book ."

S"original 1994 edition , consumed 10 years later . cork was soggy wet and fell apart upon opening , so i do n't think it was just the ride back from the packy that did this cork in . speaking of the packy , he 's a good guy , kept a few of these for 10 years , then sold them all to me when i mentioned his brother ( also has a liquor store ) sold me some five year old . and this from the liquor store that does most of its business trading can deposits for flasks of vodka . back to the beer , it was in great shape despite the cork , probably because of the thick seal that boston bc put on the thing . it poured a thick dark black , no carbonation whatsoever . i was expecting something in the vein of worldwide stout , a little port-like but beer nonetheless . i was blown away , by the fact that this beer tastes nothing like beer . kinda like chocolatey , syrupy port . but less sweet , and thicker . somewhat drinkable , but not in the way a wws is . great mouthfeel and smell , like raisiny port . it took some dessert , an hour , and a couple friends to finish the little 8 oz bottle . overall , i was impressed , and for the $ 5.99 , it was a steal , compared to a $ 15 chocolate bock , which i will never buy . get some if you can , and hoard it , and pop the cork in 10 years from now when it has mellowed out ."

S"750 ml corked and caged bottle . 11.5 % abv . poured out a clear auburn with very frantic carbonation and a thick white head . i 'm quite surprised that a beer of this strength would hold such a head , and with each sip , the head slowly slides down the sides , leaving a chunky lace . big points , in my book . what hits my nose most prominently is this estery apple juice smell . elsewhere in the aroma , i find dates , old hops , and a hint of alcohol . flavor is an upfront biscuity malt mingled with medium acidity apples . it is , at first , sweet , but it never becomes cloyingly so . although it does seem to increase in a mildly sticky sweetness as i continue to drink , a mixture of mild hop bitterness and equally mild alcoholic warmth and bitterness balance things out quite well , but not perfectly . i am really impressed at how well the alcohol is hidden . i 'm not too fond of high abv beers totally hiding the alcohol , neither do i like it when the alcohol is nauseatingly apparant . urthel quadrium manages to fit in the comfortable median . the mouthfeel is soft and velvety on the tongue while bubbles lightly touch upon the tongue . the subtle carbonation then leads into a drying of the mouth . although the slight alcoholic bitterness can get a bit obtrusive at times ( moreso as it warms ) , this is an incredibly quaffable ale . this is my first offering by urthel , and i am quite impressed . at $ 6.99 per 750 ml of this , i will surely fall back on this as something to treat myself to every now and then . although this was quite different from the st. bernardus abt 12 i had some months ago ( and i really do n't know which one better represents the `` style '' ) , i found this to be uniquely different and uniquely delicious ."

S"22 oz bottle poured into pint glass is pitch black with a thick off white head that slowly subsides into lace . strong aroma of bitter chocolate , coffee , vanilla , alcohol , and spices . taste is intensely sweet malt followed by strong coffee and cocoa flavors , with an alcohol finishing presence . carbonation is low and feels rich and milky . the alcohol makes it a sipper for sure . according to the bottle it 's a combination of choklat and java , and i think the sum is more than the parts , this really is an incredible combination of flavors and one of the most unusual and satisfying brews i 've had . well worth the price and this would make an incredible desert ."

S"pours a cloudy red brown beer with a tan head , i gave this a good 3 day rest in the refrigerator , might not have been enough to settle the yeast in the bottom . smell is sweet and very fruity with a lot of spice in the alcohol fume part of the scent . black pepper , apples and oak ride the alcohol fumes to the nose . after a while vanilla , brown sugar and bourbon scents become separate from the other aromas . taste is very neutral at the start with no strong flavors or sweetness to surprise your tongue . without any strong flavors ; subtle flavors and nuance are what make this beer . pleasant flavors of vanilla and oak make up the first recognizable flavors and remind me of cajun bread pudding as they make it in new orleans . bourbon is tasteable here but it is n't strong and melds in to a mild butterscotch flavor with a nice spike of vanilla to it . alcohol is detectable but is by no means strong and servers as a carrier of subtle flavors . if this beer has a fault it might be too mild mannered . mouthfeel is good . an exceedingly mild mannered barley wine here that is by no means offensive at all . dangerously drinkable for the alcohol content . i see this as an excellent candidate for a christmas nightcap or for the basis of a pleasant mulled beer for the holidays ."

S'undated 12oz that has been dipped in red wax poured into a pint glass . dark crimson with a small white head that falls victim to the abv leaving a ring that encompasses a swirl of foam that looks like a slowly spinning galaxy . rum soaked raisins , cherries and raw homemade bread dough . a pinch of christmas spice hangs in the back . the alcohol is a big part of the aroma , but it smells like it has been mellowed by time . the nose reminds me of north coast old stock that has been cellared for a few years . the alcohol is part of the flavor , but when looking at the big picture it fits perfectly . the raisins are there along with some of the citric cherry flavors with subtle notes of yeast . its all supported by a nice backbone of malt and enough bitterness from the hops to add further balance . the mouth is very full and threatens too much oil and syrup , but it backs off before going too far . this is a sipper and a delicious one at that . i hate giving a 3.5 for drinkability , but take that as a recommendation to slow down and enjoy .'

S'this stout is extremely unique in that it has amazing drinkability due to the lack of any real defining flavors ... it has this very mild earthy coffee flavor , with just a tiny bit of bittersweet chocolate present ... probably the best mouthfeel/drinkability out of any bottled brew ive ever had the good fortune of tasting ... if this was made in kegs , which i understand its not , it would definately be the upscale equivilent of guinness ... much more appealing tastewise ... even though you cant find this on tap anywhere , you have to love the flask-like antique reproduction bottles ... i had to buy a couple the first time i saw them ... cheers ! ! ! !'

S"nice , fluffy , slightly off-white head on top of a orange-amber cloudy beer . good looking in the glass and decent lacing . i do n't smell much here except some yeast-like aroma . the flavor is nothing like a true hefeweizen . it tastes good , i like it , but it 's not a hefe . i do n't taste any wheat tartness , just a bread-like wheat flour flavor with a touch of yeast in the finish . a bit sweet , and pretty dry . it 's actually very tasty , just not within the style guidelines nothing noteworthy about the mouthfeel . like i said , dry . this is a very drinkable beer . it tastes very good , but i gave it low marks because it 's nothing like a hefe . value-wise , it 's a great bargin . at $ 9 a half-track , it 's a tasty summer brew that 's always in my fridge ."

S"a provocative pumpkin `` pie '' brew leaning on a very sweet and biting spicy side . presentation : 22 oz . bottle . pop and pumpkin/halloween design around the image of a crowned jack'o lantern . side narrative noting nod to celtic folklore and dwelling on how it makes the brew quite the ride . it continues with a superficial magical note and serving recommendations to finally- barely start describing the brew and go back to esoteric nonsense , which finallly in their style concludes with a line to enjoy the beer with responsibility . no printed bottling date on side , does not note ibus , but shows plato ( 19 ) , and alc . by vol . ( 9.0 % ) alongside detailed list of ingredients . poured into a tulip glass . a - medium amber intense orange with a nice creamy head with average to low retention leaving some lacing . s - spicy pumpkin smell , all-spice , cinnamon , and sweet aroma working rather well . t - here things get rolling on a more extreme note . the taste increases aggressively the smell presentation and punches with intense spiced sweetness . very spicy and sugary with tones of distant pumpkin . the extreme is in the sugary and biting spiciness feeling a supportive malty backbone . m - medium leaning on high body with good carbonation early and fading somewhat quickly . some creamy smoothness turns at some point to a thick highlight . d - it is really not that drinkable . i was using a tulip glass and this is more suited as a sipper to share , probably as a dessert drink with those that enjoy off-hand pumpkin pies . notes : i 've had my share of pumpkin pies , maybe not enough , and i rather like them . but this one is certainly not close to anything i 've tasted before . it 's as if the cook dropped the whole jar of spices and a pack sugar by accident and let them roll . i like what st does with this provocative beer that often are hit or miss for drinkers . this is the first one that is a miss for me . i do n't know how to use it ... it could be a dessert beer but i do n't have the audience that would like this type of highly spiced flavor for a pumpkin pie . not a bad ale but it 's not much of a pleasing brew for me , and i 'd rather choose quite a few other pumpkin beers ahead of this one ."

S"after reading the wildly varying reviews , i had to get my hands on a can of this polarizing brew . with a bit of apprehension , i popped the top and poured semi-aggressively into a new belgium snifter . a - cloudy/murky orange , with a white , quickly dissipating head . ends with some wispy lace . s - musky mildew mixed with over-ripe citrus and wet hay . the smell is rather mild . t - very balanced , but huge , and follows the nose . citrus gives way to a moderate bitterness , while the summit hops lend that a unique earthiness . best described as an east coast ipa with a west coast dipa malt base . m - medium thick , oily and slick . d - the huge flavors make this a sipper beer , and the high abv certainly does n't help . one is very enjoyable , but any more would be a bit much . i 'm very happy to say that i fall on the pro-gubna side of the fence ( mostly since i spent the money to get a can ) . if this was available around me , it would have a pretty regular spot in my beer fridge ."

S"pours a light copper color with a full head . the head faded much faster than expected , and within a minute it was gone . the nose has sweet malts , breadiness , and light hints of overripe plums . because of the complete absence of hops , the malts take control in the mouth . the beer is well balanced , though , in that i would never describe this as an overly `` malty '' beer . there is an almost caramely sweetness on the edge of the pallet that pairs with a slight bitterness ( the gruut ) . it has a very nice malty finish , and is very drinkable . gent 's only brewery , this is a rather unique spot : the brewer uses gruut instead of hops as the bittering agent , and the lack of hops is immediately noticeable . though not off-putting , it can be a shocking absence for `` hopheads .

S"originally reviewed april 9 , 2005 . bottle at the gitchee gumee brewfest 2005 . this beer pours a peculiar milky brown , almost like molten caramel . the aroma is stingy and heavily tannic , but a little sweet and floral . the flavor starts off somewhat rounded and chocolately , but then i get blasted by this bland hot spice , that speaks slightly of roasted pepper . im not pleased . i dont like hot things in my beer . nobody has executed a hot pepper beer that shows balance or melds with beer 's other characteristics , and this is not that ."

S"appearance - pours like a thin red wine , touched with a speck of brown or orange . a finger+ of tanned cream sets up , then falls back and holds nicely at a thin cover . aroma - different smells at different times . grain , anise , bubblegum , orange pez , and all aromas come wrapped in a soft , vapory rubbing alcohol booziness . a little on the lighter side for intensity , it does maintain presence via the abv if nothing else . taste - lots of grainy depth . some sweetness is paired with the grain , but i ca n't attach it to any particular fruit or sugar type . immediately after the swallow comes hop bitterness , maybe some light citrus , and the expected wave of abv heat . the finish has a moderately raw bitterness and alcohol warming effect . as barleywines go , this is simple but okay . mouthfeel - i like the thickness and smoothness . ramped up carbonation . drinkability - an above average beer in the world of beers , but not so much in the barleywine category . maybe some age would help this one blossom ."

S"poured into a sa perfect pint from the beer 's growler - 64 oz . no bottling or freshness date , only a `` must be refridgerated '' on the label . i think this is due to the fact that they do n't use preservatives . pours a classic witbier look : an off white , slightly yellowish color with a nice cloudiness . one finger white head forms and then falls , leaving brief lacing that returns to the beer . tons of carbonation keep a whispy head alive . smells of fruit . i get a grapefruit , orange , and maybe even a pineapple . there is a `` sunny d '' /orange peel quality to it . very sweet . at first sip there is a big malt note . after that the taste kicks in and the citrus comes out . the sweet orange kicks in , then yields to the bread malt . in the aftertaste , after a big chug , there is even a slight spicy note to it . there is a real feeling that there is straight up orange juice here , you can detect the acidity from time to time . the mouthfeel is great , this beer is n't really wet or dry , just neutral , and the carbonation keeps this one refreshing . a little watery , as well . you can certainly knock a few back without blinking an eye . like the reviewer below me said , i would be surprised if this really had alcohol in it . heck , i would be surprised if this was beer ! what a great summer beverage , a little plain and one sided , but drinkable , nonetheless . edit : olde burnside 's website indicates this beer to be 5 % abv"

S"beer on tap at a local beer bar . my wife ordered this and we shared it . beer is black with a brown thin head made up of big soapy bubbles . there is some lacing on the glass but i ca n't see any carbonation . it looks fine ( served in a snifter btw ) . i did not look at the menu until after i took a sniff of this beer . i immediately asked my wife what the abv was , 18.2 % . shit . the beer kind of smells like nail polish remover . its sweet and really really hot . lots of alcohol in the nose . really knocked me over and made me fearful to drink it . bring on the extreme . beer is primarily sweet and thin . the description on the menu says that it was made with jasmine and cranberries . if you say so brewdog , i do n't get any of that and i 'm usually pretty good at picking stuff out like that . drinkability is fine for such a giant beer but mouthfeel is too thin and there 's not a lot going on in the taste department . the liquor quality of this beer overwhelms any subtly and any flavors you may have wanted / been expecting . i did n't order this beer but it represents a `` new '' trend in brewing and by brewers , especially this brewer and others like dfh . bigger is n't always better , more ethanol does n't make you some brewing genius . how about a session beer everyone ? how about something with some flavor other than malt and ethanol ? how about making a beer with cranberries and making the cranberries the star ? i 'm sick of it ."

S'poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pilsner glass . took a while to pour as the head on this yeasty , hazy , amber brew was tremendous . all and all a nice appearance that left a thick lace curtain on my glass . the smell reminded me of coming home from camping and realizing that everything you have smells like the camp fire . very smokey , but also quite malty and yeasty . the taste was excellent . the smokiness of the smell was quite prevalent with plenty of sweet malty flavors to balance it out . slight hoppiness and also quite a bit of flavor from the lager yeast , but really more of malty smoked wood flavor over all . the mouthfeel was rich and full bodied , a bit filling actually , which is why i only gave it a 3.5 on drinkability . over all an excellent offering that i certainly would try again .'

S"poured into a standard pint glass.- dark reddish-brown color with a very light tan head - a very thin appearance . even with a strong pour i could only get about a quarter inch of fizzy head that dissipated in seconds , leaving a dark cola looking beverage . definitely not as big as most russian imperial stouts . malty aroma - not very complex . a small amount of sweet chocolate as well . very sweet malty taste - too sweet for this style in my opinion . perhaps a bit of over-ripe dark fruits once the beer warmed up a little . a bit of coffee lingering on the roof of my mouth remains long after i swallowed . the relatively low 8 % alcohol content is masked well , but the flavor is very underwhelming . extremely thin with no carbonation . well , i guess it is drinkable . goes down easily with zero carbonation . unfortunately , it really does n't taste that good . overall , this is not what i expect from an ris . the beer is thin , weak , and in my opinion really should n't even be classified as a russian imperial stout . i was extremely disappointed with this one . consumed : 11/12/2009"

S"not the first time i 've had this one , obviously . appearance is great , as always . huge foamy head with tons of lacing . smells of light malty coffee and some sweetness . i always think the taste is stronger than it ends up being . very delicious , but a little light for my taste , but that is the point of the style ... so i 'll say average . overall great beer for the style at a great price . i do n't know if you can find a smoother drink ."

S"a deep , dark , burgundy brown color , and a thick , full , rocky , tannish head . aroma sizzles over with all things good , a sensory overload of hop sensation : fruity notes , earthy notes , hints of leather and lavender , grapes , wines , figs , raisins . one of my all-time favorite aromatic brews . a full pallet-load of hops on the palate ( sorry , could n't resist trying that one out just once ! ) a flood of brilliant bitterness on first sip , that just keeps giving and giving and giving . solid malt here , too , holding everything together . fierce and fiery , like the breath of the beast that graces the label and gives this ale it 's name . hot , substantial , and impressive , the dragon is formidable ! one drawback is the `` drinkability '' issue . my first time with the dragon , i shared a750ml with a friend , and still woke up the next am , moaning and groaning , able only to utter : `` guuuulden drak ... guuuuuulden draaaaak ... .. '' had a 11.2oz.er for the purpose of this review , and i felt it terribly the next day . how to rate the ease with which one drinks the dragon , when the dragon always slays you ? `` yes , i 'll have another '' ... some other day ... ."

S"in celebration of our chief 's speech ! pours a beautiful golden color with some thick fluffy head that leaves great lacing . smell is unusually weak . i smell citrus hops but it is barely there . taste is not weak , in fact one of the more robust dipas that i have had . very bitter with citrus hops . mouth is medium in both carbonation and body . drinkability is low as this is kind of harsh after more than a few sips ."

S'presentation : 16.9 fl oz bottle with no freshness date , brewed according to the reinheitsgebot 1516 on the label . appearance : ruby tinged brown with a decent clarity through the darkness , slender tan lace stays put almost all of the way down the glass . smell : smells of the same smokiness of a smoked gouda cheese or imported german ham . faint grain in a charred kind of aroma with a growing maltiness . taste : thick medium to full body , deeply textured carbonation to bring on a smooth mouth feel . a tight ball of chewy maltiness hits the palate first with its sweetness . smokiness is multi-level , with straight on smoke flavours to woody , charred and mild charcoal flavours . hop ? where are they & # 8230 ; the smoke is here and here to stay . mild spicy alcohol and warming in the back . maltiness stays , it does not disappear it just is an underlying flavour pretty much throughout . slight caramel and toasted grain flash past the palate before another round of smoke flavour hits . light residual sweetness is played by the leftover smoke flavours . notes : an obvious acquired taste . love it or hate it . i love it but it is not a brew that i could drink more than once in a while . i love to visit it especially when i am having bbq or any kind of grilled meat . i paired it with some cheeses , aged sharp cheddar and a ripe sheep & # 8217 ; s milk cheese .'

S"2009 vintage 11.5 % 12.7oz cage and corked bottle ahh , the infamous brandy angel 's share , saw this at julio 's and could n't pass up the chance to try the ( potential ) trainwreck from lost abbey , although the pricetag was close to scaring me off . pours into a chalice , dark brown color with only a hint of bubbles ( shocking ! ) , no lacing but she has legs on the glass . smell has a large presence of oak and caramel malt , bit of a soy sauce presence , huge aroma of alcohol , even picking up grapes ... taste is an odd mix of oak and caramel malt , significant alcohol burn , very soft carbonation ( there is a slight hint of it , but you kind of have to search for it ) , sticky in the mouth but not overly syrupy , still picking up that weird soy sauce with grapes taste . honestly , it 's not as bad as i was thinking ( not triple bock bad ) , but i wo n't be buy this ever again , not even at a significantly cheaper price such as $ 3 . maybe it needs a bit more age to mellow out the alcohol and wood characteristics . i 've got its brother the bourbon version , so we 'll see how that one stacks up with my lower expectations ."

S"12oz bottle into duvel tulip . appearance : free pour yields a two and a half inch fluffy white head that dissipates slowly leaving thick rings . pours a dark reddish brown and leaves short lived streaks and spots of lacing . smell : smoke and roasted malt . lots of spice , and a good amount of herbal hops sort of underpinning everything ( gives it a real airy character ) . sweet malt smells . taste : good mix of sweet , malty brown ale flavors with smoke and roasted malt . tastes like it smells , but not as spicy and hoppy ( leans more toward the savory , smoky character of the aroma ) , though there 's a nice hop bitterness at the end . finish is , again , mildly bitter and very bready . aftertaste is like white bread . malt is the star here , as it should be . in reviewing this beer , i wish i had a lot of homebrew experience , because there 's lots of strong , clear malt characteristics to the flavor that i suspect would be easy to name if one is familiar with the ingredients . i can say that it 's a solid brown ale . mouthfeel : lighter side of medium bodied . juicy . pretty carbonated ( too much for me , but it goes fine with the flavor ) . drinkability : while i respect that it 's a good example of the style , i was n't really wowed by this beer . it 's a little too savory for me i think , or perhaps these flavors just are n't what i was in the mood for tonight . either way , i 'd have one if a friend bought a 6pk of tumbler , but i probably wo n't buy any more myself . if you 're looking for a nice clean brown ale with not too much sweetness , not too much smoke , lots of balance , and lots of malt , tumbler delivers . it was n't really to my tastes , but it was n't bad either ."

S'poured from a bottle in my beer drinking glass . the beer was a dark brown , mahogany color with only a slight beige lacing that had little retention . the aroma is dominated by the smell of the malt . there is also a sweet note that offers a nice contrast . the taste is highlighted by the interplaying flavors of the malt and the sweet notes from the grapes . the moutfeel is average , with only a slight amount of carbonation . the beer is acually drinkable considering the abv . the alcohol does not overpower the beer at all . overall , this is a decent beer to try but is not worh going far out of the way to try . another good beer from dogfish head .'

S"like most of the other recent reviewers , i obtained the 2001 vintage , and consumed it in april '03 . the bottle proclaimed , `` the world 's most extraordinary beer ; '' that and the whole dec 6 brewing thing perked my interest . while it is indeed extraordinary , i ca n't really say that i enjoyed it . what little head the beer initially had rapidly diappeared . there was very little carbonation . considering that this is an austrian brew , these attributes seem out of character . however , i can see that higher carbonation could negatively impact the drinkability of such a stong brew . otherwise the appearance was nice : clear , dark and appealing red color . i immediately noticed the aroma : very strong , much like that of a dopplebock with the volume turned up . the alcohol was apparent even in the aroma . the strength of this , however , effectively masked any other subtleties there might have been to the aroma . the immediate aspects of the taste i noticed were the sweetness and the alcohol . note that i say sweetness , not maltiness ; this is a pronounced sweetness without a complex backing . it 's much like flat root beer in this respect . the alcohol lurks a little while , then strikes , and it strikes hard . it was n't until after a few drinks that i felt the wamth in my chest , but then it was a juggernaut , breaking down my sobriety and composure . the strenght of the alcohol flavor , combined with the simple sweetness , made this a rather unpleasant drinking experience for me . barleywines and imperial stouts- both strong , though not comprable with the likes of this and beelzebuth- provide intersting body and hopping to go along with the strength ; this is an experience i prefer . hence , i suppose i am more critical of the style than of the actual beer ."

S"week long vacation starting today , start off tonight finishing up some work with style by breaking out one of these . never sat down with one at home to review . 12oz bottle poured into oversized dfh snifter . bottle graphics : classy , b+ a : the beer looks innocent on the pour . pale orange color with a thin head that faded fast . s : ultra sweet smell , nothing remotely close to any form of ipa . smells like a true barleywine or flat out wine . a slap in the face of sweet flavors . somehow the hops make themselves known so you know for a fact there are a ton in there . alcohol detectable ? oh yes , the alcohol is more than noticeable . warms the throat just from the aroma . t : bold , sweet , bracingly intense . no more hops really but somehow , some way you just feel that they are there in the flavor . something nutty coming through that combines with the hard alcohol flavors . just like ive had when on tap and from younger bottles , the hops finally start to be detected and its just mindblowing intense in a variety of ways . m : the heat of this bad boy sets the tonsils on fire . carbonation doesnt even bother trying . as thick as some grade b maple syrup straight from the trees of vermont in the fall . d : i like this one with a little more age but i can say ive also enjoyed a 6oz pour from tap even more at a fresher date . at 21 % , it is shockingly 'drinkable ' . you will not have more than one in a sitting but after a few other low hitters , this one comes in a bats cleanup like bonds on his balco regimens . an experience ."

S"cracking this in honor of tonight 's hailstorm ( the perfect storm would be even more fitting , but i reviewed that one two days ago ) . 2008 bottle , 11.2 oz , poured in a big wine glass at 54f . murky light brown with red highlights , opaque , with a minimal film of head , substantial lace . big aroma of spice cake , including plenty of clove , along with ripe banana , and milder notes of brown bread , red apple , and heady solventy booze . cohesive , and quite nice . tastes sweet and boozy , with loads of clove laden spice cake , caramel , apple , banana , bread crust , and a hint of brown sugar . the booze becomes increasingly solventy , making for a hot finish . a hint of astringency emerges in the finish , counteracting the sweetness a bit , but not enough to achieve real balance . but it tastes good , the spice cake , bread crust , and fruit flavors are quite enjoyable . after the solvent and alcohol have faded , the clove still lingers for a long time . medium-full body , with nice tiny bubbles to scrub the tongue . 11.2 oz is a nice drink . there 's no way i would drink a second bottle immediately after the first , unless paid to or coerced . compared to the regular aventinus , i like the concentrated spice , malt and fruit flavors in this , but not the concentrated solvent and alcohol flavors , plus it lost some balance along the way . still , i enjoyed it ."

S"poured from a growler into an american pint glass . a -- textbook brown ale color : deep almost burnt caramel , but light enough to pass light through . no red at all in the body , and the color is very uniform . half-finger white fizzy head dies immediately to a skim , and the glass gets dots of foam -- let 's call them toes instead of legs , or threads rather than sheeting . s -- very little hops so there 's nothing strident here , but if you open the holes a bit and really snuff and swirl , snuff and swirl , you get more than just sweetish malt notes , as there 's clearly something darker and nuttier cutting the caramel . a definite roasted character comes through in the nose . t -- and lasts through the tasting . roasted and nutty are the primary adjectives of this beer , with toffee and caramel taking a back seat . there 's even a splash of hops on the finish , but it 's mild . the real star here is the hazelnut/walnut flavor that 's more than roasted ; like real nuts the taste adds bitterness to balance the sweeter notes . could use a bit more biscuity/crackery malt notes . m & d -- mouthfeel is n't anything to rave about , as you 'd expect something a little more oily or at least silky , slick somehow , given the nuttiness , but ends up simply being thin and a little watery . easy to drink , this brew makes a great middle depth addition to its exemplary triumverate of session beers , which include on the light end the freshchester pale and on the dark the pleasantville smoked porter . very subtle and smooth brown ale . more like an english brown than sixpoint brownstone , which is kind of a brown porter , or smuttynose old brown dog , which is fairly sweet for the style ."

S"a- pours a very pink color . points added for a decent head with good retention on it . most fruit beers screw that up . s- smell is of strawberries , sweet , with just a hint of coriander and orange , as advertised . they promised strawberries and delivered . there is just a little beat of yeasty twang as well . but largely strawberrry . t- the taste is more sour whereas the nose suggested sweet . coriander , orange , and wheat are vaguely present . as it warmed the yeastyness became more apparent to me . m- light with low carbonation , which is good , as overcarbed fruit beers tend to seem like soda . d- it 's not bad , for a fruit beer , but in the end , it 's still something of a novelty beer and not something i seek to sessionize ."

S"2009 vintage , have a few of these , gon na age the others for awhile . pours a dark , dark brown , pretty much black with hues of ruby and magenta when held to the light , a pretty divine looking brew . the head his large and tightly foamed , it is an off white and takes some time to recede leaving some nice lacing . smell is ultra sweet and carmally , there is a hint of rasin and of course a nice large hit from the bourbon barrels lending it some vanilla , alcoholic , and oaky notes . the mouthfeel is incrediably creamy , thick , and smooth . the carbonation is low but it works very well . this beer is pretty sweet , but not cloying . the bitterness is up there as well , though it mellows out as you go . the alcohol is noticeable but not overbearing . most of the flavors include bittersweet , tons and tons of caramel , dark fruits , alcohol , oak , vanilla , bourbon , and a small reminder of the hops that once were . this is an extremely complex brew , and it was suprising to me at how good it was , i was n't expecting this monster of a beer but i guess i should have . despite the largeness i find it pretty drinkable , though it is a slow sipper . an amazing brew ."

S"boilermaker hit it on the head with much of his review . this is a big beer . tons of grapefruit . tons of hops . tons of alcohol -- and it tastes boozy , too . the one thing i might add is that it has the treacly taste of excessive alcohol . yes , it has tons of hops . but , unlike other great hoppy beers , the hops do n't quite mask the thick , syrupy alcohol flavor which lingers like a sweet whiskey ."

S"beer pours a very nice golden/amber color with a very thin head . little to no bouquet other than a very light earthy smell . it had a very light grainy after taste that was somewhat grassy . it was tasty and something that i would never turn down but it did n't leap out at me as something i would add to my shopping list to purchase once again due to just kind of being somewhat unremarkable . as for mouthfeel it had a somewhat biting carbonation that would make this a decent choice for a hot day . after finishing off a bottle it did n't sit heavy at all ( like the stouts i normally prefer ) and instead was pretty refreshing ."

S'the colour is deep copper-gold with a tint of red . the two finger head slowly sinks down to a off white thick lid . lots of lacing . clear liquid . the smell is a little sour-bitter with some creamy semi sweet malt . some notes of rye bread , roasted nuts , alcohol and a hint of bitter almonds . the taste is fresh with a clean bitterness with some sourness . there are creamy mild flavours of lightly roasted malt and some dry and very british yeast . the aftertaste is bitter with hints of lemon , bitter almonds and some herbs . the carbonation is average with small refreshing bubbles . the liquid is medium smooth . one of the most english ale from the us that i have reviewed ; it reminds me a lot of the marston old empire ipa ( i.e . a little to dry for my taste ) .'

S"well this one definitly stands up and kicks you in the sack . the appearance is extremely dark and the smell , though with an obvius alcohol presence , does still offer chocolates , coffee and some hints of licorce . yes we all know this is a very high abv brew and if you 're knocking off points for balance and taste , then do n't buy an 18 % beer ! ! ! this beer can still be enjoyed . i found that having two beers before it gets you ready for the big dose of booze , and that is how would approach this one ."

S"on tap at the brewery . seems this beer has now been retired , and let 's just say i 'm not exactly crying over that fact . this light blonde ale is not very exciting , but hell , it 's only a 3.2 % er . pale yellow color with a fizzy white head . aroma is grain and pale malt , flavor is more of the same with a light hop character . a little watery on the palate but not too bad for what it is . take your average blond ale and water it down a bit , and this is what you get . hey , it 's drinkable at least ."

S"well , here 's an interesting brew . i had one of these in my fridge , left over from my wedding , so i figured hey , why not ? it poured a 2 inch head right off the bat , which surprised me , but it looked like dishwater foam , and dissappeared in like two seconds . zero lacing . this beer is exactly the color of ... .well , if you 've ever had to pee in a cup , you know the color . of course , the clear glass bottle proudly showcases that . it smells like ... citrus . big effing surprise . taste was not too pleasant , but it would have been better right out of the bottle . the extra carbonation would have made the strong lime flavor a little more tolerable . i usually do n't directly dis beer , but this one was pretty bad . i 've had one at a club and it was n't horrible then . i guess you just have to be in the mood ."

S"`` the terrapin dos cocoas '' gets its name from the deep history of chocolate and the two forms of ecuadorian cocoa we use in this exceptional beer . brewed with 100 % cocoa powder , and aged on a bed of pure cocoa nibs , the chocolate flavor in this beer is so mouth watering ; it will even make wonka jealous . '' poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass . emerges milky black with a touch of chocolate highlights . topped with aan average sized , cold steel colored head . aroma is somewhat lacking . a touch of bakers chocolate but mostly a fruity/earthy aroma with a touch of an alkaline type aroma . no roastiness . flavor is a let down as well . kind of watered down . a touch of chocolate malt with no `` real chocolate '' flavor . this one has no body ; very watery , dry finish , and no oomph . mouthfeel of water with cocoa powder . drinks like water . not sure what is going on here . not much chocolate and the porter aspects are very subdued and `` english '' . with all of the chocolate hype going on with this beer , i was expecting chocolate . not to say it isnt a decent porter ( although lacking body ) , but not what the beer claims to be as per the label . really thin and unremarkable . another disappointment in the series . thank god it looked good ..."

S"i was pretty excited to try this since it combines two of my favorite styles , so i went into it with pretty high expectations . huge head almost looks like a root beer float , thick enough that i even dipped my finger in and tried the foam , which was very hoppy by the way . the aroma is pretty much what you would expect , syrupy and yeasty malt from a trippel , and hoppy from a dipa . the hops were quite skunky and resinous , as opposed to a more floral or citrus smell . the taste was initially like a trippel , yeasty syrupy malt that was a little spicy , followed quickly by an array of hop flavors , mainly perfume-like resinous and floral flavors , with a little citrus flavor . as the beer when on though i had a harder and harder time with it . when the novelty of the combination started wearing off , i did not like the overall feel of the beer . a very pine-like and resinous hop flavor started to dominate the beer in the finish that i was having a hard time stomaching with the thicker belgian malt . after trying this beer , i feel like dipas need a sweeter malt to balance the bitterness from the hops , not a thick starchy syrup malt . there were some good darker fruit flavors that came through from the combination of the sweetness in the malt and the tartness from the hops , but as a whole , i was not too impressed with the taste of this beer . the mouthfeel was a bit dry from the resinous hops , it was n't sticky at all from the malt . the drinkability , for me , was way down since it found the flavor so trying . i appreciate the creativity of this beer , but i just felt like it was the wrong combination of styles , and at least of hops . i want to try a something like this with more citrus flavored hops and less pine-like ones ."

S"had this at a campfire over the weekend as an after dinner beer , fantastic and hoppy . poured a clear almost orange with a finger 's width of white head . head thinned very fast , lasting only a minute . lace was minor . smell is very hoppy , strong earthy scent with mingling of citrus undertones . taste is very dry and earthy . hop dominates , citrus is definately underplayed but has a nice subtle comeback in the finish . mouthfeel is very dry and a bit heavy . carbonation is a bit weak . drinkability is good . the hop flavor is a bit too strong to make a usual customer of me , but it 's a very nice variation , and the flavor alone is impressive . very nice for a fall beer , the second best seasonal imo behind st 's pumking ."

S'good pour ... nice golden color . at first glance and whiff , looks and smells just like a bud , bud light , miller lite , or pbr for that matter . but i didnt prejudge it based on that . i know sn uses natural ingredients so i was optimistic that would come through . unfortuantely , it didnt : ( . i love sn beers a ton , but not this one . it tasted just like above said less expensive offerings . cool bottle and cool feeling that its a sn product , but this beer just has no wow factor like other sn beers like celebration ale , torpedo , pale ale , etc . i do like miller lite sometimes , but unfortunately miller lite is much much less expensive . i think sn needs to rethink their spring offering . perhaps add some more hoppiness to this golden bock and give it some sn character . it needs something to make it stand out .'

S'the promo flyer says : a malty lager made with german pilsner & munich malts . lightly hopped with hallertauer and saaz hops . sits in the pint glass a pretty clear , dark , ruddy , burnt amber color , that shows some deep red highlights when held up to the light . it is topped by a wispy , thin , tan colored head that quickly disappears . sweet malty aromatics are dominant here with some notes of caramel , and some malty fruit derived notes that remind me of raisins . the beer is quite sweet , it certainly hits the fullness / mouthfeel of a doppel bock correctly . there is a lightly spicy finish that is contributed by both the carbonation and a subtle hop character . a light bitterness is here as well , not quite enough to balance the malt , but that is what one wants in this type of beer anyways . the sweetness seems a bit one-dimensional . i am not sure why , as this is certainly malty , but it does not seem to have the malt depth of a great doppel bock . the sweetness actually projects a berry-like flavor in this beer . this beer is certainly hearty enough for this unusually chilly tucson afternoon though . the sweetness and malt really help it to cut through the food that i have ; it actually pairs quite well with the reuben and fries i am currently eating . the food actually brings out the malty complexity i was searching for earlier ; maillard by-products , caramelized notes , toffee and even a touch of roast character are all noticeable as i eat my sandwich .'

S"sometimes , living in indiana rocks . for example , i can find this beautiful offering at the freakin ' grocery store right next to the venerable two-hearted ale . ahhh . now this beer is a masterwork from fff . it pours a slightly hazy amber with a rock-solid dishwater head . mmmm , that head really released a lot of wonderful aromas . pine and citrus predominate and , man , it smells good . very 'merry christmas ' , but not in the tinsel-and-cookies kinda way , but the 'i 'm some crank wandering around in a pine forest and i 'm giving presents to strangers ' kinda way . it definately ai n't normal , but it sure is delicious . the only reason why this beer is n't an ipa is because it is n't bitter . the malt covers up and bitterness from the hops , and they mostly hang out at the fore of the beer anyway . you get a wonderful blast of hops followed by a nice light caramel which preps you for the next blast . i can ( and do ) drink this beer all day ."

S'an amber beer with an off white head that displayed good retention and lacing . the nose was quite bitter , hops but it also had a smell of rotten fruit , rather an unpleasant note for something that i was about to consume . this theme continued with the taste an initial hit of bitter hops followed immediately by the rotten fruit again , berries i think , but too skunky . this was followed by a smokey/burnt taste in this medium bodied beer . i was really disappointed by this as i liked the other black sheep beers that i have tried . from the other reviews , this has fans , but it is not to my taste .'

S'appearance - deep but clear amber . the head is solid and fairly long-lasting for a beer of this gravity . smell - earthy hops and sweet caramel malts . the hop presence is pretty bold , disguising the high abv . taste/mouthfeel - very rich . caramel malts are nicely balanced by a strong hoppy bitterness . estery notes hide in the background , bringing to mind pineapple and mango . sweet but not cloying ; the finish has a slight drying quality that keeps you coming back for more . full-bodied with a semi-crisp carbonation .'

S"poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter . this beer is opaque black in every sense of the word , with a really impressive , pillowy tan head . the head subsides very quickly , however , and leaves only slight lacing . the smell was not very interesting really , smelled pretty much like a guinness if guinness made malt liquor , lots of hints of fusel alcohol . the taste was worse than the smell , unfortunately . there is no presence of chocolate or coffee flavors at all in this beer as there are in other ris ' . it tasted pretty much like a mixture of cough syrup and the fusel alcohol i mentioned before . i do n't understand where people are getting the complexity . mouthfeel was good , thick and oily like a ris should be , but the taste ruined the experience and therefore the drinkability . i was hoping it was just a bad bottle but i bought another one and it had the same exact problems . i really really wanted to enjoy this beer because of its high rating , but i 'm starting to think it 's rated so highly simply because its a seasonal from a reputable brewery and because its so high in abv . i wo n't be buying this again , sticking to old rasputin ."

S"i received this brew from drjay many moons ago in a trade . this will officially be my first brew from kuhnhenn . drank from my ithaca excelsior tulip . 2004 vintage . *note : my score is temporary until i get a newer bottle of this to compare . i either a ) got a bad bottle b ) got a bottle past its prime or c ) just do n't care much for this beer . appearance- pours a murky dark brown with zero head , zero cap and collar and no lacing . smell- holy intense ! plenty of raspberries to start things off but something tells me that they 've faded a bit over the years . the intense caramel is really what seems to jump out of the glass and is definitely the star of the show . chocolate is semi noticeable but not to the extent of the caramel . interesting nose to say the least . taste- starts with a super sweet burnt caramel like taste that is somewhat chocolaty . there is a strange bitterness that is rather intense at first and lingers into the aftertaste . since i get little , if any , raspberries i 'm assuming that the weird bitterness is what 's left of them . very astringent as well with a semi chocolate aftertaste and super hot finish . mouthfeel- fairly thin with zero carbonation and a bit of warming on the way down . drinkability- well , needless to say the drinkability is lacking since i could n't finish the bottle . i know this beer is way better than what i got to try and i 'm guessing it 's just past it 's prime . new score to come with a newer bottle . big thanks again to jay though for his generocity !"

S"i hate to give bad beer reviews to breweries i like and respect highly . however , despite the gorgeous label and earnest label notes , this ale really did not hit the mark . gruit beers are not the easiest to nail , granted , but all the same this was a bit of a schizophrenic drinking experience . pours out a very cool looking glowing harvest orange with almost no head to speak of . no lace is left in its wake , but the color remains strong and pleasant . nose : flemish chicken , herbal notes , honey , ginger , unibroue edition 2004 , corainder , fresh grain , spiciness . taste : sligtly sweet and then overwhelmingly sour . more herbal , honey , ginger , and spice notes hide behind the sourness , but unfortunately the sourness is the dominant feature . this fades eventually with some remaining grain notes surfacing . pleasant at the very end but not worth the trip through the rest of the beer . the mouthfeel is merely wham , bam , thank you ma 'm . not a beer i 'm gon na rush back to and it may hinder me from buying the heavyweight variety pack again ( wherein i received this bottle ) . honestly , i was thinking maybe i could swap the gruit ale for something else when no one else was looking and get away with it , but then , what would they do with the stray bottle of gruit ale ?"

S'pours opaque black with a medium/small tan head that dissipates quickly . smells strongly just like milk chocolate with a bit of roasted malt - very unique and nice . roasted malt flavor with a lot of chocolate , obvious and pleasant but not overpowering . some hops are noticable in the finish and the beer finishes with a lingering roasted malt bitterness . surprisingly this is pretty balanced . mouthfeel is excellent- thick and creamy . delicious but the heaviness and chocolate flavor do take a bit away from the drinkability of this brew . awesome overall .'

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into 16oz . long trail tumbler . fairly transparent copperish color with a minuscule off white head which rapidly turns into virtually nothing but a small ring around the glass , carbonation is fairly solid . lacing is non existant . the smell is mostly of sour dough bread , biscuity malt and a mild fruity aroma which for some reason i just can not identify , an extremely mild floral scent finally appears 1/2 way through the glass . taste is pretty good . sweet malts all the way on this with an extremely conservative , mild tea like bitterness , finish is clean & crisp but seems to just die almost instantly leaving behind an unmemorable lingering sweet & gt ; semi dry mouthfeel . drinkability is quite good due to the sweetness and crisp carbonation . in a way i like this beer , i find it to be quite drinkable and a fairly decent interpretation of the style.i tend to like almost everything that flying dog puts out ( with this being included ) and although some of their beers do n't always knock your socks off , they do however provide a fairly sessionable lineup at a reasonable price . i think this would be a good transition beer for someone who prefers a bass ale , and is looking to broaden their horizons into the world of craft beer . an all around good entry level beer from a pretty reliable brewery ."

S'this beer was included as an extra in a trade with dbhog . since i did not have a stein on hand , as the label suggested , i just decided to put it in a duvel glass instead . color is a hazy dark orange , with a half finger of white head . aroma has some dry grainy husks , bit of caramel sweetness , traces of fruit here and there , slightly musty as well . taste brings on more of the same , but more subdued overall . taste also clues you in that this is a lager and not an ale in the way that all of its conponents intermingle . good carbonation , and a pleasant hoppy bitterness lend itself well to the drinkability of this beer . at the same time , one is good enough for me . a good beer from surly , and much more refined than their other brews . again , like all of their other products , i wish i had access to them here . thanks again to bill for this one .'

S"this famous bock deserved a try but i did have low expectations . to my surprise , shiner bock was not as appalling as i expected . no surprise it lacked flare or excitement but a tolerable boring beer . appearance : pours a clear bronze brown color with a small quick fading head and little notable lacing . it does have a constant flow of carbonation bubble rising through the body of the beer . smell : bad . i did not like the smell . i was prepared for the worst when it got to the taste but it does taste better than it smells . it is a grainy corn husk aroma followed by the artificial sweetener and dextrinous malt attribute and some metallic character . not really enjoyable . taste : the taste was a relief after smelling this thing . it was not terrible . it is a step up from michelob amber bock if that is saying any thing , but does not even reach the level of flavor saranac has . to put into perspective the mundaneness . it is a toasted grain flavor with a drop of caramel and a metallic prod to the back teeth ( like when you bite a fork ) . not offensive . mouthfeel : fizzy an thin in the mouth . extremely light body . drinkability : the beer it not all that tasty but it is not offensive either . it is light . once you get used to the metallic attribute it actually becomes quite drinkable . though i wo n't buy it again while i have other options . hope this is helpful . cheers !"

S'poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a goblet . appearance - pours a very murk dark orange/brown . the head is about one finger and somewhat soapy and tan at first . it quickly settles at a thin but very creamy light-tan head that leaves good lacing on the way down . smell - rich dark ripe fruits , mainly fig and cherry . some slight smokey character , and some peppery spiciness with just a hint of clove . a huge bread pudding-like malt character that acts as a foundation for the rest of the aroma . some background sweetness of rich caramel and molasses . slight warmnth on the nose from the alcohol . taste - lots of ripe cherry and fig right away , with some moderate alcohol warmnth . some earthy notes right away , though they are mild . floral and herbal hops mixed with some caramel and candied fruit sweetness . again a huge bready malt with more earthiness mixed in . the finish mellows from the fruits and transforms into a mild sweetness with a full and rich malt character which tasts slightly toasted ( but only toward the finish ) . alcohol warmnth all the way through , but mainly at the beginning of a taste . mouthfeel - luxuriously smooth mouthfeel with a medium body . would have been a perfect mouthfeel ( it really is heavenly ) , but the beer turns completely to foam toward the finish . extremely smooth , though , and no unpleasantness at all from the carbonation . drinkability - very strong flavors and at 11 % abv and noticeable , this beer takes a hit in this category . a wonderfully full-flavored belgian strong dark ale . the flavors are fantastic and complex , and it has a sublime mouthfeel . a must have !'

S'i had the opportunity to drink a bunch of these on a boat that had only canadian and budweiser . last night i uncorked one into a galss and here is the review . not much color ro speak of . a bit more amber than your regular macro . a clean taste , thin and sweet and finishing with a bitterness that is not part of the flavor , just there for the bitterness . no hop flavor . but the bitterness may save it from being overly carbonated and overly sweet . defiinitely loads of flavor beyond budweiser , the bench mark for american macro fizzy yellow rice water . it is better from a bottle that is pulled out of a cooler after sitting in there so long that the ice has melted down to floaters and the label is worn off , but you could do much worse buying canned beer .'

S"i submitted this as a `` pale mild '' because it is listed as an english-style session beer . what ever you wish to call it , it is a very solid brew . copper colored body with an off-white head that was a little thin , but left a nice lace . the aroma gave off some subtle nutty and caramel aromas . the flavor is light , with hints of nuts , caramel , and a touch of hops to clean things up and hold it all together . the carbonation is low , but it gives it an excellent mouthfeel . finish is very clean with decent bitterness . some may find the mouthfeel a touch on the light side , but i found it very satisfying . drinkability is first rate with a rather low abv , although i do n't know the actual % ( supposedly comparable to their `` lyte '' offering ) . a very fine brew for a night of continuous drinking , or for enjoying with your meal ."

S"i like victory a lot . mostly because they 're about the biggest local craft brewery and have an ever wider ranging spere of distribution . hop devil and storm king stout were two of my first forays into the east coast ipa and american imperial stout styles , respectively , when i first go into craft brews . donnybrook stout and prima pils showed me it 's ok for craft breweries to mimick convention and do `` small '' beers . so ... it 'd been a while since i had this one . honestly , last time i found it too juicy and prickly . it was like drinking pine needles soaked in canned pineapple juice . not like the maltier , rounder hop devil . not so this time : ( ap- poured into a latrappe chalice . nice and light ... i prefer my double ipa 's to be lighter hued than the norm . looks like a pils or helles bock it 's so light . actually , a little more color would have been nice , but now i 'm just being picky . the real dilemna : no head ! ar- grapefruit juice poured from a can . slight grape juice and citrus . not as pronounced as i would have liked . more chemical than organic : -/ t- sweetish . not sappy or cloying , but honey and grape juice prevail . some hop bite , but more moderate than i remembered/expected from a dipa . very smoothe hops actually , more like hop stoopid 's hop extract additions . really , if you told me i had bought an american pale ale i would say this was spot on , top of the class . but it 's too mellow for the style ... . no bitterness ... no piney hops ... no bite ! m- amazing . i have come to find hop devil to malty , though that malt does hold down to gritty hops . this beer lacks those hop varietals and drinks more like a juice . i wan na drink it from a sippy cup . `` a beer this strong should not drink so easy ! ! ! '' screams my liver . o- well , it 's a good beer . i tried it not long after having another robust beer . but i 'm sure my palate had settled , and i was n't too buzzed . i also paired it with food half an hour later . it really lacked the snap ! that you expect from an american ipa . it tasted like it was fronting really . a soft kid who wonders onto the other side of the tracks trying to be something he 's not . i was disappointed . sure i think many ipa 's are too crass ... chinook and simcoe are used in abusive excess , and cat piss has become the new snail &"

S"presentation : 22 oz . bomber bottle poured into my portsmouth brewery tulip glass . served at room temperature . appearance : light brown to darker orange in color . pours a one finger white , piloowy head with decent retention . aroma : the belgian yeast definitely hits first . lots of fruit notes and clove here . hints of caramel and booze soaked raisans behind that . a touch of grassy and herbal notes round out the aroma . i really do not get a cohesive aroma from this . a lot of the notes do n't really work well together at this point . taste : belgian yeast notes of fruit and clove are definitely present and assert themselves first . there is definitely a strong caramel and dark fruit presence here as well . there is also a ton of hops here . bitter , astrigent hops really take over the beer and actually completely overpower the other components at times . the hops really do not pair well with any of the other components , especially the belgian yeast . together , they impart an artificial and almost band aid quality , which clearly is not appealing . there are some qualities here , but they are drowned out by bitter hops and too much booze . mouthfeel : full bodied and smooth . not a ton of carbonation . i would prefer a bit crisper feel for a beer that feels this heavy , in flavor and feel . drinkability : i had a lot of problems finishing a bomber of this . the abv was not too bad for 12 % but i just really did not enjoy the combination of flavors working here . overall , an unbalanced beer without any direction . too many big flavors that do not compliment each other . the amount of hops used really confused me , they add no nice hop flavors , just astrigency and bitterness . i would not be against revisiting this beer with some age on it , but i have to imagine it would need at least two or three years for the hops to subside and the malt to become the attraction , when paired with the belgian yeast . definitely would not recommend this to anyone at this stage . i was letdown a little by this ."

S"a- poured out a deep copper-gold . no head , but a thin film that persists throughout the drinking session . s- ah , ruination ! bitterness overwhelms just about anything else in the aroma -- in a good way . i do get some ipa citrus notes , but it 's almost entirely a zesty tang on the nose . t- same on the palate . zest and bitterness all up front , down the middle , and in the back . it 's phenomenal . ipa citrus and even some hints of sawdust are there , but the hops and bitter tongue-pucker are dominant . not one-sided , though , or unbalanced . it 's a great , lasting flavor that has plenty of complexity . m- light and quite carbonated , which helps to balance the taste . d- for me , a beer with average drinkability . one is definitely enough to satisfy any jonesing for hops that i might be experiencing ."

S"out of the bottle into a snifter . appearance : murky and intimidating . dark like midnight , gothic dark , evil dark . beautiful , thick , billowy head . smell : chocolate . chocolate eclairs , chocolate fondant , chocolate pastry cream . anything that is chocolate+creamy+sweet . espresso notes are light , like someone is brewing a stovetop cafe downstairs . roasty , big and in your face . did i mention chocolate and tons of it . taste : sweet chocolate cream , big malts and espresso on the finish . the chocolate notes are huge , almost to huge . i feel like i just sucked the filling out of a krispy kreme chocolate filled . mouthfeel : thick and full . like drinking hershey syrup . big on the start , big on the finish . leaves a chocolate coating on the mouth that is there until you brush your teeth . viscous and thick , period . drinkability : ones enough . its so big and in your face that 4oz 's is plenty imo . more of a digestivo that a beer . overall : great nose and presentation but a little to unbalanced and thick . i 've never tasted this much sweet chocolate in a beer and never thought a brew could have so much cocoa character but the novelty wears of quick and gets a little trying ."

S"2010 batch , from the bottle poured into my narke glass ... a medium brown with lots of dark amber in the light , unique . a watery light tan head , not much there ... sweet aroma , distinct english barleywine backbone , but lots of wine comes through . toffee , red wine , caramel , mild hops ... .the taste is pretty mild shows off the barrel more than anything , vanilla with lots of red wine . this barleywine was too light to hold up , but its qualities , but tastes good none the less . i ca n't recommend this , but i drank the bottle pretty easily ."

S"this gueuze poured like a double ipa in the humid sunshine of two brother 's hop juice release party : tart and astringent , it was mellowed by cask conditioning . it even had a little head on it , which seems to elude many farmhouse ales and sours . i have n't had many gueuzes ( gueuzii ? goeose ? ) , partially on account of the overwhelming sourness of the style , but the cask really mellowed the harshness and generous malt made it quite drinkable for an extremely extreme beer . i would swear there was apple cider in it but was told `` no way ! '' reminiscent of unibroue 's ephemere , only that 's half cider ! vinegar : no dill pickle , and reminiscent of festina pesche but with more body . i 'd love a brother daryl to compare it to , and would love both brother and other brother together side-by-side for direct comparison . fabulous addition to the two brothers festival : great afternoon addition to the lineup . i hope allagash considers a limited release bottling , or at least casks another for next year 's festival ."

S"poured from a bottle marked 9446 indicating that it was packaged november 9 , 2009 . appearance : pours dark brown with a tan colored head that lingers throughout the entire beer . some floaties visible . smell : big roastiness jumps out with pleasant notes of dark chocolate/cocoa rounded out by some grassy hops . by far the beers best trait . taste : the roasted malt flavors dominate as indicated by the smell . roast malt initially followed by chocolate and grassy hops . not a whole lot of sweetness -- you get some upfront but its quickly overtaken by mild hop bitterness . well balanced . mouthfeel : lacking in mouthfeel considering this is a cream stout ! i expected a hearty mouthfeel and it just falls short . not viscous enough and its compounded by prickly carbonation . drinkability : i could drink a lot of these considering the great balance . another great beer from bell 's , but this falls short of what i have come to expect from a cream stout ."

S"served from bottle into goblet at about 40f form a 2009 bottle . this is a interesting beer , no doubt . the initial aroma is of cider and whiskey- no doubt due to the ridiculous amount of malt present in the wort . the aroma is strong- much stronger than i 'm used to from any other beer . the flavor is very sweet and syrupy- somewhat too sweet to be very drinkable . surprisingly enough there is almost no taste of alcohol or hops- the sugary sweetness of this brew masks everything else . there is an obvious skill to making a beer this extreme but the results are less than wholly enjoyable on flavor alone . this would be best extremely cold or , perhaps , on tap ."

S"i just had to try this at least once . `` continually hopped over a 120 minute boil and then dry hopped every day for a month '' , sounds reasonable enough ... it pours a thick , beautiful deep caramel orange with a massive , chunky head that just sits there after a heavy pour ; very nice for such a high alcohol brew . the nose is intense , i 'm not even sure how to describe it . heavy orange marmalade , toffee , bubblegum , and a cotton candy-like sweetness ; hops are there but very sweet and citrusy . taste is incredibly thick and complex . heavy dextrin sweetness up front , more cotton candy and bubblegum , heavy tongue numbing alcohol , grassy pine notes , wow ! this is a huge freakin ' beer . honestly the sweetness is a bit much , and pretty cloying and syrupy throughout . finish is like sucking on a sugar cube ; intensly sweet and hot from the alcohol . mouthfeel is something like maple syrup , extremely heavy and viscous , with an equally heavy body . carbonation holds together pretty well considering the amount of alcohol . i 'm not sure about this one . it 's extremely syrupy and sweet , and the hops kind of get lost in all that malt . pretty good beer overall , and very well done considering it 's strength , but probably not something i 'll have again anytime soon ."

S'2006 ceramic bottle , consumed 03/24/08 . beer pours almost black ; even intense light does not penetrate this inky brew . a foamy brown head forms with a moderate pour . it starts out three fingers high but eventually settles down to a skin of foam . aroma is not particularly appetizing . sour is the dominant note with metallic cherries and oats bringing up the rear . mouthfeel is only slightly thicker and slicker than water . carbonation evidenced by the head is lacking on the palate . flavor is a malted , somewhat bitter chocolate with oats . notes of salty burnt toast and soy sauce also appear . not particularly complex or enjoyable . it goes down smoothly and creates a little alcohol burn . i love big imperial stouts , but i think they need to work on the recipe a bit here . i wonder why the draft version of this i had was so much better ?'

S"corked and caged 750 ml bottle with a slick looking wrap around black label that has a pitch fork with 3 small smiley faces at the tip of the spikes . over the pitch fork in bold blood red letters is the name of the beer . to the left side of the bottle is where you 'll find r.r 's address and to right side is where you 'll find everything you need to know about this beer . this is where they list the abv % , government warning , a phone number , a picture of the proper glassware , the definition of `` damnation , '' a lengthy description about the beer , and a batch number . my bottle was from batch # 020 . appearance : the proper glassware picture looked like a cross between a snifter and a tulip , so i decided to pour this beer into my lion brewery tulip . the label stated that it was a golden ale , but from the looks of it , it was n't . it was close to a golden color . the color was more of a hazy and pale lemon yellow . i held it up to the light to see if i could find any gold coloring , but it was just a waste of time . i found a small tint of orange , but no gold . sitting on top of this lemon colored brew was a great 1 1/2 inch creamy pure white head of foam . this creamy head of foam had pretty good retention that left behind a milky white film and a streak or two of lace . smell : i guess it was just me , but i thought the aroma was lacking . the aroma was fruity and a little spicy with pear , a touch of green apple , a pinch of lemon peel , a subtle drop of tart grapefruit , and a dash of black pepper and allspice . quickly following the fruit and spices was a whiff of dry yeast and a hint of floral hops . if the fruits would have came out more , then this would have been one top notch fruity/spicy aroma . taste : the taste had something in common with the aroma . they were both fruity and spicy , but the taste had more of a kick in it . the taste kicked off with the fruits first , green apples , green pears , a little lemon peel , and a subtle touch of banana . the spice of choice in the taste had too be the allspice . i could taste another spice trying to break through , but the taste was too small for my tastebuds to decifer . the kick that separated the taste from the aroma came at the end . that kick was the taste 's dry bitter finish . this bitter finish was mostly"

S"wow , man does this one have a price tag ! but it 's hard to beat these well made foreign sours , and i guess i 'll pay what i have to . into the saison dupont tumbler ... a - blood red with almost no head . kinda low-frills actually . s - huge cherry aroma here , no surprise , with a nice twang of bacterial acidity . i 'm not really getting a whole lot else in this aroma , but the depth of the cherry flavors really is striking : sharp cherry acidity , deep dark fruit sweetness , i swear i can smell that slight dryness of the rind in here too . t - the flavors mirror the aroma for the most part , only much more focus on the sharp acidity in the mouth . dry honey-like sweetness here too . very assertive , but i do n't think i 'll need a antacid ... yet ... m - very low carbonation , so an unblended lambic it is . silky mouthfeel helps balance out the prickly feel on the tongue from the acidity . d - i have to knock the score down a bit , due to the price , but for my money , this is every bit as great of a lambic as anything i 've had from cantillon or 3 fonteinen . sharp acidity and big cherry flavor , but still feel like i can taste the lambic underneath . glad i dropped the money on this one , a great way to spend the night ."

S"bought a 660ml bottle from quebec . poured a clear light brown , once the yeast fell in it really clouded over ( so to speak ) . smell - not much in the nose , bitterness . very difficult to get any sense of what to expect . flavor - yikes . bitter and sour ... very sour ... .far too sour ... you can taste the malts hidden under the sour overtones . almost like a token red ale with lemon juice squeezed in . very lemony and sour grape . no real complexity at all . finishes with a strong bitterness that is a bit much and linger 's far too long . not my choice of beers . reminds me of a home-brew that just did n't turn out properly ."

S'holy foam , pouring this beer took about ten minutes , and this was as gentle a pour i could administer . after i was able to pour the whole bottle , i noticed the head is a slight off-white and leaves a nice film of foam for all twleve ounces . the color is a hazey burnt sienna with some chunky sediment on the bottom of my beer . the aroma is a soft toast with even softer notes of just moistened bananas . the taste starts with some tin , light white bread , and some unmalted grain . the middle still has a little tin , but add to the malt flavors , some yeasty banana and clove . the finish is all malt and yeast and leaves a light , dry sweetness on the palate .'

S"i only recently returned to serious homebrewing and beer enthusiasm after close to a decade of basically settling for what i could get at the local trader joe 's . while plenty familiar with the old-school , west-coast originals , i was thus way behind the times when it comes to the great second-generation ( 1990s ) craft brewers , not the least of which is stone . the whole gargoyle motif and `` arrogant bastard '' 'tude never really did it for me , but i 'd read so many good things -- and more than that , i 'm a proud socal guy who 'll firmly believes in thinking globally but drinking locally -- that i finally had to get with the times and try this stuff . bottom line : good but not great . i 'm just an old-school guy , and the over-the-top , ibu-flooded bitterness is just not for me . i love the fact that a stone exists and that they 're willing to push the envelope , but for me , the defining factor of a great beer is balance and harmony . while arrogant bastard offers that in its wonderfully inviting , strong but not overpowering , aroma -- sweet and citrusy , that i pegged as grapefruit at first but then became more mango-like , with a very pleasant floral hop background -- the flavor is just too bitter . as the beer warms , the complexity begins to come out in the background , but it 's still dominated by the raw , even harsh , bitterness of the excessive hops -- kind of like a good piece of music being overpowered by the bass being turned up way too high . if only the bittering hops were turned down , allowing some of the sweetness of the malt to come through , this would truly be a great beer . or maybe it really is a great beer , and i 'm just `` not worthy '' ."

S'pretty dark in color -- difficult to see through though definite varnished wood and ruby highlights swim about all the edges . big light tan head versus the oftentime deep brown head of stouts is the first indication that this one is a little light . chocolate ice cream aroma with coffee overtones . some light roasty grains in there . flavor is predominantly coffee but is a little weak . very easy though and very pleasant . the mouthfeel is the big loser here . this is medium-bodied at best -- maybe an average porter . however , the drinkability is through the roof . this is a thin beer with a pleasing flavor and a nice , well-blended aroma . how can you not slam several ?'

S"pours black with a nice tan foam that fades quickly . not too much lacing or retention . meh . i 'll give it the benefit of the doubt though , they have a rockin ' pedal steel image on the label , the guy who the beer is named after . aromas foremost of roast , some chocolate through the middle . picking up a little general fruitiness as it warmed ... for some reason i 'm thinking berries but it 's a little odd . the taste is much of the same . some chocolate and roasted malts initially , leading to a little fruit mid-palate before a semi-bitter chocolate finish with a little grainyness . medium bodied with a low carbonation kind of does n't help the lack of vibrancy in this beer . i would 've liked a little higher intensity of flavor here , although everything was well integrated for what it was . it feels like it should be more robust , but it 's not . alcohol was well integrated and i could 've easily taken down the bomber , but chose to use part of it for beer brownies instead ."

S"like a lot of us , i really used to like guinness when i first got into drinking better beer . since i 've been checking out this site and trying new beers all the time i really kind of forgot about it and have n't had it in a while . last night in honor of st. patty 's i started my night off with a guinness on tap . i really was n't too impressed . i mean it still has those typical guinness things that you like ; the nice classic guinness appearance , the easy quaffability , etc ... but it 's really not that tasty to me anymore . there are better dry stouts . so i was thinking this last night and then my thoughts seemed to be backed up by the forum post about the declining quality of guinness over the years . it 's definately been popularized and rather macro-ized and really has kind of become a characature of itself . i prefer it out of the can for the cascade effect but really it 's kind of just become a novelty act ."

S"this beer pours black as night with a small head that recedes to a thin ring around the surface . the aroma is complex with elements of chocolate , coffee , dark fruit ( cherries ) , malts , hops and alcohol . the taste is similarly as complex as the aroma beginning with a chocolate taste then moving into coffee , then onto bitter malts and hops and at the tail end a hint of alcohol . the mouth feel is smooth with a bitter aftertaste in the back of the throat . i had to give it only a four on drinkability because it is quite strong and is not something one can ( in my opinion ) easily down or have every day . overall this is an interesting brew and i ca n't wait to see what happens with aging this thing . it 's worth the price ( $ 15.99 for six ) seeing as it 's quite interesting and a one off release . definatly check this out while you can ."

S"batch 74 , bottle 373 : this beer pours a black color with a moderate head depending on how vigorously you do it . the smell is mostly of fruity hops , and you can tell that there are a few different kinds . more of a tropical taste than citrusy like most of them . the taste is simple , which you would n't expect from the more complicated nose . the first taste is of burnt malts . the second has a good amount of hops to it , but still retains a simple mouthfeel . it also lingers for a long time after its swallowed , and is pleasant ."

S"got a preview sample of this product that will be released in january . my sample was a 12 oz sample bottle . the final product will be in a 750ml corked and caged . pours a nice dark chocolate colour with a minimal head ( could be due to sample glasses ) that was a caramel colour . smell is of hot cocoa . rich and deep chocolate smell without much bitterness . taste -- its like hot chocolate beer in a bottle . smooth and creamy with cocoa , vanilla out front in the middle and in the back . that said it is balanced well enough with hops to keep it from being cloying . mouthfeel is smooth and creamy not much bitterness drinkability is average only due to the fact that i personally dont think i could have more than one due to the chocolate flavour and a bit of a heavy profile . possibly one of the best `` dessert '' beers ive had in that it could be a dessert . one could pair this with some raspberrys or strawberries and be set . also it pair extremely well with pecan pie . other notes on this beer according to bbc . it is brewed with two row pale malt , munich , caramel , and chocolate malts . it also has scharfenn-burger chocolate , cocoa , and a bit of vanilla tossed in the brew kettle . hops used are tettnang and spalt spatzer . the package looks beautiful , dark bottle with a pewter coloured embossed labe . supposed retail will be about $ 14 . maybe a bit pricey , but definately a beer to try . supposedly it will be pushed hard for valentines day . extra note -- the rep claims that this can be cellared , but i was kinda sceptical as the abv is only 5.8 and not hoppy at all , but then again they should know better than me ."

S"a - pour appears pitch black but when held to a bright light , it 's a very deep burgundy color . there 's a thin toffee colored ring around the top of the glass and carbonation is pretty much nada . s - dark roasted/toasted malt , bitter chocolate , a little bit of charcoal , dark cherries , figs . t - the warm booziness going down certainly is n't hidden , that 's for sure . flavor stays pretty consistent across the sip with strong dark fruit , bitter chocolate , and dark roasted malt dominating most of the palette . about midway through the tongue gets completely slammed with an onslaught of pine hop bitterness . a bitter hop bomb and no doubt , right on target with the rest of the hopped up beers in the leviathan series . there 's also some bits of charcoal lingering in the background to dry things out . dry dark cherries also come to mind with this beer along with some wheat malt character . m - heavy body with brutal hop lingering bitterness coupled with bitter chocolate and burnt toast stays in the mouth for a long time after the fact . d - one hop bomb of a beer . a little too extreme for my liking of the style , however , i love all the other leviathans . i 'd like to try aging a few bottles to see if they mellow over time ."

S"what an experience of a beer ! had this given to me 'drive-by ' style from an overly generous waltonc . smelling this beer while walking up to my front door truly took my breath away . the distinct raspberry tartness and ripe plum sweetness were extremely pronounced , and then the lactic acid that nearly made my eyes water . as i walked in my home and held the glass up to the light , the dark maroon , slightly oxidized tone was just beautiful . again , the aromas hit me and i could n't help but spend the next two minutes taking it in . very bold . the taste was so direct and sharp with a highly acidic nearly raw rhubarb tartness . very unique transgression from fresh lemon juice pucker to a semi-sweet combination of dried cherries , raspberry coulis and a very strong vinous essence . after a few second on the palate , the harsh acetic acid did horrible damage to my tongue . no degree of balance , rough around the edges and a bit excruciating to get though . there is no head , even with a harsh and very violent twirl in my glass . with that said the mouthfeel came not from weight but from the very long and tart finish . even with a chaser of water this beer wo n't let the inside of my mouth go ; held hostage by the extreme blast of 'american wild-ale ' . the sharpness and extreme tongue piercing qualities eventually numbed my mouth enough for a certain level of enjoyment to play out . a bit of earth and a hint of funk but overall just too much acetobacter for me to really be convinced . veritas 6 is completely unique and very distinct in it 's style . not as complex or nearly as rounded as some of the older gueuze beers . with this one really comes to understand why these beers need to be blended . this is the turley of the beer world , rather than quietly letting you find what you like , it just yells obscenities at you . big beer , wo n't forget this one , and wo n't hope to come across it any time soon ."

S'12oz poured into pint glass . very clear golden hue , decent head , some lacing . smell is hoppy , grapefruit , citrus , not detecting much else . taste is initially all hoppy , then sweetness out with a bubblegum sweetness that reminds me of gumballhead . mouthfeel is medium , decent carbonation . i can see knocking about about 12 of these without much problem .'

S"light amber-honey orange body topped with a 2-finger white-orangish head that quickly disappears . nose is full of berry sweetness , mostly raspberry . slick mouthfeel with highly active carbonation in a light body , on the sweet side with berries and heavy raspberry and honey , even more evident on the way down , with relentless sweetness in the aftertaste . not much in the way of hop bitterness and totally unbalanced , even lacking berry tartness . not the more rugged brew i was expected with the mountain name but even on its own metrics , too mind-numbingly straightforward . perhaps for the crowd that would appreciate something like no . 9 ( as i do ) but lacking any semblance of subtlety and restraint . even my friendgirl thinks it 's too sweet ."

S"a -- for a brown ale this sure does look black . held up to the light i 'm struggling to find any highlights . a semi-hard pour gets slightly less than a finger of head that recedes quickly but leaves a thin layer over the top . lacing is trying its best to stick but its struggling . s -- there is a pronounced boozy smell that overshadows the rich layers underneath . slightly too much , kind of like a fresh bourbon county stout but not as strong . vanilla , wood , and roasted malt peek through . t -- the wood taste comes through huge . it did n't taste as boozy as the smell would have suggested , which is a plus for my palette . bourbon , vanilla , malt , maybe some caramel but all fairly well balanced other than the wood . this tastes good but i have a feeling i would like it more with at least a year of age on it . m -- probably as heavy of a mouthfeel as a `` brown ale '' will ever get . very thick and creamy , almost as even the thickest of stouts . for a comparison i would say it is just a tad thinner than speedway stout . awesome . d -- one and done . i could n't get down two of these if i tried . i would like to age one of these for a while and see how it turns out , i have a feeling that it would be even better and much easier to drink . this is a very unique beer , but if booziness is not your thing it may turn you off . no matter what though , it is unquestionably impressive ."

S"cliff notes : beck 's clone . pour a nice crystal clear golden color with a thin white head . mild noble hop aroma as promised , with a slight maltiness . taste delivers on what the aroma promised , nothing more , nothing less . body is bit on the lighter side , which is entirely appropriate for this style . very refreshing a drinkable . a beer without any noticeable faults , but nothing to differentiate from the pack of good german pilsners ."

S"pours a murky gold color with highlights of light orange and amber and thick white head . the appearance is by far the most impressive part of the beer . the smell is super fruity and sweet . berries of all kinds and wheat . the flavor is bursting with what tastes like artificial fruit flavors . reminds me of fruity pebbles . every berry sweetness you can imagine with a cereal wheat backbone is exactly what this beer tastes like . no trace of hops or hop bitterness as the sweetness is just overpowering and kills any other potential flavors . rather gross . the mouthfeel is decent . its thin and well carbonated for its body . the drinkability , for me , is nil . if i had to drink the whole bottle , it would have been a drainpour , but it 's my girlfriends favorite beer , so i decided to take a couple of notes for the sake of reviewing ."

S"pours a clear amber with a one finger off-white head that dies down to nothing over a couple minutes . decent retention , and some nice , everlasting lacing . a tiny giraffe forms in the large but sparse bubbles that remain atop the brew . the nose is rather disappointing . not very easily detectable , even in my chalice , but i can smell some earthy grassiness . a little malty sweetness too . the taste is an even bigger letdown . the bitter hoppy flavor present in sierra nevada 's pale ale is here too , just magnified greatly . i like it in the pale ale because it is balanced and tasty . in torpedo , it is overpowering and unpleasant . these are n't the citrusy grapefruit and pine hops found in more common and popular examples of the west coast ipa . the hops are simply bitter and unidimensional . i am not a fan . mouthfeel is admittedly pretty good . very well carbonated , with a clean finish . the excessive , unbalanced bitterness causes a bit of astringency though . drinkability is very high if you are into this brew . the alcohol is well hidden , and i could imagine killing a few of these on a hot day . with all the hype surrounding this beer , i was expecting much more . yes , it is a solid , tasty brew , but in my opinion , it is simply not worthy of its a- rating . there are better ipas that are almost as readily available for the same price or less . i probably wo n't buy this again ."

S"bought this up in charlotte ... ooh , wax over the cap , very fancy . this brew pours a nice amber , a bit darker than most ipas with a fluffy and slightly fizzy white head on it . aroma is not like most dipas , which burst forth with the hops and citrus and pine . this one is more subdued and sweeter , though with a bit of slightly citrus hops in the far background . taste is the same , sweet and subdued , only sweet apples and almost no hop bitterness accompany this beer . this actually makes it a very drinkable dipa as it is hides the 10 percent alcohol very well . all in all , a bit of a disappointment , has some characteristics of an english ipa , but the hoppiness required of a dipa is all but missing . this needs a little more work , but it 's worth a try ."

S'a - rootbeer or cola brown with absolutely no head . a slight haze of whispy smoke covers the top of the brew . this is purple when held to candlelight and the hoards of sea monkeies dancing in the brew become visible . s - wonderous aroma of chocolate cake , tootsie rolls , little debbie snack cakes , yeasty chocolate coated donuts , some gentle grapey vinous scents , and light touches of leafy hops . t - german chocolate cake , loads of yeast , and a humongous alcohol presence dominate the palate . behind the chocolatey malt and strong spiced rum alcohol flavors , a gentle hop bitterness adds to a dry finish . m - super thick and gritty with a huge alcohol kick in the teeth . this has as much in common with a fine scotch as it does beer . d - the gargantuan alcohol burn makes this a slow sipper , not a sessioner , but i will return to this once in a while when there is time to slowly enjoy this fine brew . i drank this by candlelight when our power was knocked out one snowstormy night and this was the perfect warming beverage for the occasion .'

S"my first barleywine , and quite an experience ! poured from a 12oz bottle into traditional pint glass . a - dark mahogany . tan , thick head that dissipated quickly s - some alcohol , coffee beans , dark fruits and chocolate t - dark fruits hit first , alcohol a presence throughout . aftertaste is all coffee beans , maybe a hint of chocolate . i feel like i just ate chocolate covered coffee beans ... only they were soaked in alcohol for months . m - oily and greasy . not at all carbonated . d - nicely balanced but packs quick a whallop . drink with caution ! whew ! big and bad ! 12oz is more than enough of this brew , i barely finished . 10/16 note : just looked at bottle again and it read `` bottled in 2003 ''"

S"i got this at the vintage cellar in blacksburg , va , i just had to have it even though the reviews were less than stellar . it poured a deep orange amber with a small off white head , very very clear . i do n't have the nose to pick out all the spices , there is a very spicy peppery start with a big sweet fruit , apples and pears , smell following the pepper . there are some flowery smells in there too . there is just as much complexity in the taste as in the nose . it starts very sugary and fruity , but that goes away quickly leaving a nice peppery , floural taste . i do n't know how this will get better in 5 years , like the bottle says , i think the floural hops balance this beer nicely right now . it has a very dry mouthfeel , even with the sugary start , that is impressive to me ."

S"a- pours very clear , and gives off a light amber/orange hue . the head surprisingly sticks around for a couple of minutes before settling down to a thin ring around my glass . carbonation looks to be fairly muted and there is n't much in terms of lacing but it is there . not the worst looking beer out there . s- very faint malts , but primarily the aroma consists of dusty grains . the alcohol is fairly noticeable as well , and otherwise smells of lots of adjuncts like corn and dextrin mainly . i do n't smell anything that resembles hop bitterness or really any honey either . t- well this area has some life at least . again , the primary flavor is much like the aroma , that of grainy corn and the alcohol is noticeable as well . there is some muted malt sweetness , and there is a weak honey flavor . the finish is slightly metallic and has some faint hop bitterness that lingers slightly but nothing to get real excited about . m- this beer is light bodied and scrubs the palate , due to the carbonation that 's hiding in there , not noticeable upon viewing . d- i am being harder on this beer than i would like to , as i have bought this before and will buy it again . for a buck a beer , this is one of the better ones i think anyone will come across , along with the rest of the pc lineup . it 's a weak version of what a true honey lager should be . it is quite easy to drink and is refreshing ... .a perfect summer beer or for someone that does n't want to break the bank but with a better value than what can be purchased , and i have had more than my share of this beer . give it a try !"

S"i 'm not sure how old this 12 oz bottle is . for reference , it has the old neon green sark warning on the cap . a : the ale is a majestic copper red hue , dark and cloudy . opaque , the ale generated half a finger of head with little retention . s : thick . concentrated . thick . hints of smokey peat followed by a full-on assault on the senses . the aroma is murky but charming , revealing syrupy fruits ( both apple and berry ) . a big nose that seems light on the hops . t : complex , the ale tastes like it has spent the last few years in a barrel of port . i taste vanilla alongside dark fruits and sweet syrup . apple , lots and lots o ' sugar . oh , and booze . the alcohol is n't hot but it is there , augmenting the syrupy flavors . the vanilla comes back near the end of each sip , a sweet soothing finish to the beasty barleywine . m : the mouthfeel is treacly , a nasty bugger that offers enough olive branches to make me come back for more before kicking me in the teeth . d : 15 % ? as my three year old would say , `` oh man ! '' i hope that as i sip this through quantum of solace that it wo n't wreck me . one bottle at a time ."

S"disclaimer : this beer was part of the shipment that came to boston in the fall of 2005 . i had heard that something had happened to these , and from my experience , that is true . so i am not entirely sure how accurate my review is of the beer , aside from my idiosyncratic experience was . it was flat out undrinkable . pours a reddish brown with a medium sized head . very thin , almost watery appearance . the beer started off well on the palate - lots of citrus balanced with a touch of hops and some crystallized sugar sweetness . then the back of that was just horrible . it was like drinking really gross medicine . it was n't sweet , it was just stinging ; piercing . i had to spill a portion of it out - i just could n't get it down . i hope that i just didnt have a good bottle and that if i get another chance to try this beer i will be able to change my review ."

S"this beer was given to me by a beer rep that was in one of the nicer bars in the general vicinity . he was giving away some weird stuff that was like orange soda with vodka in it or something . anyway , he asked me what i thought about it , and i told him . i had to explain that i am a beer snob ... bjcp and all that , so i was hard to please . next thing i know , he whips out a six-pack of this stuff and gives it to me to try . he did n't give me a card or anything , so i am going to give it a shot here ... i rarely drink a canned beer , but let 's pop the top on this sucker ... appearance : pours clear enough to read a paper through . there is about a quarter inch of head on top of this true golden beer that definitely stayed longer than you would see on a budweiser . there are a dozen or so bubbles rising through it after it has been standing for a few minutes , but the head is barely noticeable . aroma : now that is an unusual smell ! there is loads of green apple in here , but it also smells like a cornfield . i am guessing that this is adjuncts and fast fermentation but there is so much of both , it makes it smell like it has some sort of infection . as it warms , you can pick up the alcohol a bit better . taste : really dry the entire time . it is fizzy from the carbonation , so it makes it feel lighter than it is . it really `` buttery '' ( for the lack of a better word ) and when the finish finally sets in after the fizz settles down , it burns like you just took a shot of watered vodka . opinion : well , thank you all the same mr. beer rep , but i do n't think that i am going to finish this beer . i hate to waste it , but i would rather save my liver for something that tastes good . i 'm glad i did n't have to pay for it ."

S"a : pours a clear dark amber cherry color with almost no active carbonation in the glass . a few ropes of bubbles here and there but that is about it . the head on this beer saves it , with a vigourus pour i got a two inch frothy white head that melted into a decent sized ring with a decent about of lacing . i wish there were more bubbles though , it almost looks flat . s : this one smells a bit like a fat tire but a bit more subdued , the malt presence is there and quite sweet but hop characters also work in a with a nice balance , the overall effect of this almost makes this beer smell like peaches . t/mf : pretty damn creamy for a bitter , which i 've always sort of liked . a lot more subdued than ipas and other bitter beers . there is a nice bready sweetness with caramel and hints of apple , finishes quite clean on the palate and relatively light bodied , very drinkable for an almost 6 % abv beer . d : no matter how many times i 've tried this beer i always seem to be comming back to it . i must have had this beer on at least a dozen different occasions , which is a big deal for me because i am always looking for new beers to try ."

S"maybe i am missing something here but this beer does not impress me . the color looks nice and average , a pale reddish color . the smell , well it does n't smell bad . but it does n't have a strong smell either . i get a faint floral hop smell but not what i expected from a beer with `` hop '' in the name . it tastes ... what does it taste like ? i get a little hops up front , a little malt going down but that 's about it . nothing really stands out . as for mouthfeel , average again . its light on the palate and the alcohol is hidden . average amount of carbonation as well . drinkability must be the strongest suit , mostly because it is unoffensive . goes down smooth with no bitter or bite . unfortunately , that is just not my style at all . i prefer a little bold in my beer . overall , i used the word `` average '' a lot because i ca n't think of any other word to describe . the born on date is 8/12/08 so i know it is fresh . i guess this just is n't the beer for me ."

S"this was a nice treat . in the way of doppelbocks , it 's a few notches above average . the pour was very nice , indeed , looking like something you 'd see in an ad . a lovely red bronze colour with a voluminous , sticky sand coloured head that remained for several minutes . this looked great . smell fairly average for the style with some caramelised sugar , very faint dark fruit hiding way in the back , some toasted grain ; your average doppelbock . taste was nice and flavourful without being too strong . very enjoyable and almost thirst quenching . quite a statement for a brew that 's 8,5 % , eh ? there 's a `` non-threatening '' , but certainly noticeable hop bitterness on the finish . i think that balances things out quite nicely . mouthfeel is smooth and pleasant , but nothing extraordinary . considering the style and abv , i think the drinkability of this one is fantastic ! my only regret is that i have but one . many thanks to aprilluvsbeer for tossing this in on a trade ."

S"this is my beer for general consumption . when i 'm not looking for flavor or complexity , and simply want a beer to help cool me down on a warm summer afternoon , this is it . a- pale yellow . as remarked by another reviewer `` i can see my fingerprints through the glass '' . it pours an above average head for a macrobrew . s- absolutely average . it smells like corn . t-it tastes like it smells , of corn . when this beer is cold , it 's quite refreshing and simple . however when it warms up , it 's almost unpalatable . m- it feels like i 'm drinking macrobrewed beer . nothing special , just beer . d- if cold , i can drink this all day . at 6.2 % abv this beer packs a considerable punch for an american adjunct lager . considering what it is , it 's a good beer . i have absolutley no complaints when this beer is chilled . the moment it warms up , however , you 'd be best served throwing it away . probably one of the best macro 's i 've tasted . when placed in a continuum of other beers though ... it 's simply average ."

S'pours opaque black with a massive overflowing head of light brown . the spongy , rocky foam settled to a good quarter inch for the duration of the glass . aromatics are hugely laden with coffee grounds , roasted barley , and bitter chocolate . almost a bitter promise for whats to come . mouthfeel is dry and thick , with carbonation adding a perception of increased body . the pallet is unapologetically filled with coffee . the coffee is center stage , and is somewhat bitter in nature , akin to spent grounds . after the coffee , plenty of dry and roasty chocolate steps up , as does some acrid black malt . alcohol is noticeable , but no heat and does not detract . finishes with lingering bitter coffee and more acrid black patent . a big beer for sure , but the coffee is a bit harsh , and leaves the beer tasting like a coffee stout rather than an imperial with coffee . the combination of the bitter coffee , and charred bitterness detract from the drinkability , and i love black coffee ! that being said i liked it more than previous reviewers led me to believe i would . i may get another one to lay down for a few years .'

S"2003-dated bottle . appearance : pours a lovely , reddish amber color with a 'yeast ghost ' floating around the middle of the glass . a light tan head starts off a full inch tall and shrinks to a steady , and persistant , cap . this brew leaves tons of lace down the side of the glass . smell : tons of raw , pungent hop aroma with the highlights being pine and citrus . there 's a malt backbone , but it 's buried underneath all the hops . a touch of alcohol is there as well . very raw and unrefined ... i love it . taste : starts with a 'wham-bam-thank-you-maam ! ' explosion of hop flavor and bitterness . this one is still young and out of control ! just like the aroma , it 's all pine and citrus ( lots of grapefruit ) here . after the initial bitter onslaught , the malt makes it 's presence known , and comes across as caramel and fruity . towards the end , the hop flavor changes into a slighty burnt flavor . finishes with a rush of warming alcohol . mouthfeel : very syrupy and rich with a medium mouthfeel . finishes dry ... drinkability : hmmm ... this is where this brew takes it on the nose . i 'd love to sit here and kill the whole six-pack , but tomorrow morning would be rough . still , it 's a killer beer , and one of the best barleywines to be found ... while it could benefit from a year or two in the cellar to smooth out the rough edges , i love it as it is ! !"

S'a-pours a clear light straw color with about 2 inches of head . the foam died down after a few seconds to a light lacing . s-light malty nose with definite honey aromas . light citrus scent that i assume is the orangepeel stated on the label t-really noticed the honey along with a little toasted bread . the label says it has orangepeel but i dont taste it . i suppose it could be what they are using to cut the sweetness of the honey and so it just fades into the background . m-nothing special . nice crisp feel with a pretty standard carbonation level . much like drinking a bud light . d-i rate this a little higher because this is a pretty easy drinking beer . it is pretty well balanced and doesnt leave a pesky aftertaste long after the beer is gone . overall a decent beer . nothing to get excited about but much better than the average six-pack that you can get in the gas stations around here . not as good as the original blue moon probably but i have no complaints about this one .'

S"this is the only ipa other than blue dot that i 've seen that has been quite literally opaque with hop particulate . it 's almost like an unfiltered cider . carbonation is visible , but there is very little head at all , and what forms on the pour fades just as quickly . the smell is very pungently full of grapefruit , overpowering all else . this is hands down the single most hop-filled beer i have ever tasted , even more out there than blue dot . the start is a fresh , wet-hop flavor of cedar and pine , which is absolutely blasted away with grapefruit , finishing with a small bit of astringency and a healthy wallop of bitterness . bitter almost to the point of being sour , this is a beer completely dedicated to the flavors of the hop , almost completely ignoring any malt flavors . i 'm sure they exist , but there 's no way i can taste them through all this citrus . mouthfeel is a bit thin , and very drying . a bit more malt would have helped balance things nicely . i absolutely love this beer and all its hoppy intensity . that said , it is so intensely bitter and hoppy that i 'm going to have to take my time just to finish this 22oz ."

' not even a good liquor , really ... and i love ipas ! ! the problem is , when you freeze any liquid , the ice crystals that form can break down more complex aromatics and congeners that were present after the initial fermentation . so , in the case of sink the bismark ! you 've basically engineered a very strong , but very skunked ipa . the nose is - as has been said/could have been guessed - incredibly hot and full of resinous , oily hops . not much else . the heat from the alcohol does n't really transfer to the palate in lieu of the thick , oily , salty and bitter pine that sticks to the side of your tongue and completely overwhelms most of your other senses . 82 proof , stale hop-oil . i honestly felt like i was tasting the inside of a 2-week old , room temperature randall ... that was full of salt . if people can really get so much more out of this to call it , `` complex , '' ... good for them . i 'd love to be able to taste anything ( or to enjoy this ) myself , but i 'm pretty sure that the real magic behind it is the fact that you 're trying one of the craziest things to come out of any brewery . ever . brew dog , i salute you ... ... but if i want to enjoy tasting your craft , i 'll stick with the hardcore ipa ."

S"molson is `` imported '' from canada and from what i understand , is sort of a hipster brew in quebec . when compared to beer in general , it 's pretty down there in quality . when compared to the big 3 out here in the us , it 's near the top . i 'll take a tall can of this over high life or coors anyday . let 's get down to details . have you ever gotten the feeling that beer could be bacteria urine ? well it is , and this beer looks like it ! the corn taste is so strong , i thought this was a malt liquor ! the smell is a little off , perhaps the factory worker that put the caps on was smoking while they were doing it ? anyway , a little tobacco never hurt anyone . bottom line , every bottle has a different label , which is quite alright in my book . if you want a crappy american lager imported from canada , search the shelves no more . molson is your answer !"

S'pours a hazy orange , with tiny particles floating around ... decent head , retention good , lacing even better . initial impression of the nose was fruit rollups . very fruit-juicy aroma akin to hawaiin punch . definite pineapple presence . extremely alluring , yet no tips on any bitterness . taste follows most of the attributes of the smell . lots of pineapples up front , with other tropical sweetness notes run steady with a decent bitter assault throughout the palate , well into the finish . slight alcohol warming in the chest . the bitterness pokes through more after each sip with the finish . a constant battle between the bitterness & tropical sweetness . mouthfeel is pretty syrupy , decent carbonation , with a dry , steadily astringent finish . good beer , but i could only session 2 of these bad larrys , tops .'

S'into a british pint glass , poured copper-red with more carbonation than expected , two fingers of beige head , great retention , and good lacing . the nose revealed the traditional expected notes of apple , pear , biscuit , and malt . the taste began with toast , biscuit , toffee , and caramel , dissolving to the aforementioned fruity flavors , and then finishing on a bitter dry toffee note . smooth , yet slightly spritzy medium body . excellent session beer with a great flavor progression .'

S"looks like this brewery is jumping on the corona bandwagon . clear painted label longneck bottle with a turtle on it , and some marketing babble on the back about the great loggerhead turtle ( `` caguama '' ) that was sought by fishermen of central america as good luck , and a wish that the drinker has good luck too . yeah , right . this beer has been showing up in mass in grocery stores around my neck of the woods . pale straw color , almost colorless . fizzy , soda-water mouthfeel with a thin , beer-seltzer flavor . a ham sandwich overpowered the beer ."

S"head fades quickly to nothing . the beer is dark brown in the glass but appears blood red when held up to the light . aroma is spice ( cinnamon ? ) , maybe a hint of smoke , but primarily sweet booziness , and i do n't really mean that in a good way . taste is nutty and again with with malty booze . no hops presence to speak of , but at least the carbonation keeps it from being too syrupy . i remember liking this beer more than i do now . perhaps because it used to be one of the only standouts in the winter classics 12 pack . thankfully that packaging has been greatly improved ( goodbye crambic , hello chocolate bock + holiday porter ) . i will certainly fezzi credit for being true to style , but it just did n't do it for me ."

S"served in a pint glass at a restaurant . very little head , but that could be from the pour . cloudy murky dull orange coloring . the head was fluffy off-white and only hung around for a few minutes . very little lacing . familiar smells or banana , yeast , not much else . i was surprised by the taste of this hefe . a hint of banana , but not as much as the aroma had me prepared for . some light spice and slightly yeasty . ended with those well known nw hops . mouthfeel was thin , almost a bit watery , with strong carbonation . this beer just was n't what i expected to get when ordering a hefe . the hops drowned out the malt for me . the banana was about the only other thing i could taste . very simply and shallow taste . not at all the deep , complex beer i was hoping for after hearing alot hype about this brewery ."

S"i have to start with the fact that i am being extremely generous with this brewery . this is the 3rd time , different beers and different batches and styles , over a long period of time , that i 've gotten an infected bottle . is it fair to review an infected bottle ? is it fair that this brewery has consistently f 'd me ? i have n't reviewed the past buttermilk bottles i 've purchased from them , but i 'm doing this one . this is my last review of this brewery . i 'm pissed off and done , and will review what i can actually taste . they got my money , and now have to suck this bad review up their asses . a pretty honey colored brew with a white bubbly head . slight retention , no lace . light wheat malt and a very woody aroma , like a wet popsicle stick . very unique and enticing . this is the hard part . horribly sour up front . not `` tart '' -- fucking sour . an obvious infection of a beer bought cold . i do get some nutty elements and some grain , and maybe even a little tropical fruit , but the sour milk edge to this sucks . light body , decent carbonation . i want to be fair , but these guys have a broad history , over time , with me . so , overall , this sucked ass . and as much as i want to chalk it up to an anomaly , well ... it is n't . years have gone by and i 've gotten screwed again , and i 'm sure i 'm not the only one . so , this is an overall fair review which hopefully helps them to focus a bit more on quality control . but in the end , i will never drink a drop from this brewer again ."

S"drank on-tap at the brick store pub , decatur , ga served in an imperial pint glass poured a beautiful deep , dark , crystal clear , orangey-amber with a tight , creamy , one-finger , light tan head that deposited thick rings of sticky lacing . toward the drink 's end , these rings transformed into an intricate spider web pattern that blanketed the entire glass . the aroma was an amazing balance of pungent , citrusy hops and sweet , caramel malts . fruity ( tropical fruits ) with notes of mango and brown sugar . the taste was not nearly as impressive as the aroma . lots of hop bitterness in this one , without much actual hop flavor . a touch of caramel malt sweetness teased my palate before the hop assault began . the hops were very spicy and aggressive . grapefruit rind was most noticeable . the harsh , resonating finish was ultra piney and bitter . super pithy and dry . as the beer warmed , the overall bitterness of this brew intensified even more . the mouthfeel was medium bodied with a greater than average amount of carbonation . smooth , creamy and lively on the palate . drinkability was rather poor . while the aroma was punchy yet inviting , the taste was harsh , bitter and unbalanced . toward the end of the glass , the beer became rather difficult to put down ."

S"this is a black to dull maple to ruby colored beer with a thin layer of malted-milk head that leaves spider-webs of lace on the sides of the glass . the smells are cherry skin , a tickle of acrid burnt grain , light brown sugar , slight yeastiness , and earthy hops . it reminded of scotch ale on a sniff or two and the entire bouquet had a kind of fresh-baked quality . the taste starts with tounge-bracing burnt grain and then coffee and milk chocolate smooth things over , blending with a pronounced nutt flavor and well-played hop bitter . once again that baked feeling comes out in the aftertaste , on the heels on new belgium 's signature toasted character . mouthfeel starts light but fluffs up in the mouth with a burst of carbonation . kinda cool . this is a must-try for any fan of schwarzbier . it is n't nearly so mellow , but you 'll love the flavor ."

S'poured into my green flash pint glass a very nice looking beer . it pours a light transparent copper , with an off white fluffy one inch head . good lacing . a nice hint of cascade hops is complimented by a wee bit of sweetness . a nice smelling beer , but reminds me more of a pale ale rather than an ipa . on a second take , maybe i am just imagining things but i get faint wiff of an earthy sourness . nice a solid tasting ipa , and another great beer from sn . typical sierra nevada grapefruit hop bitterness , but i also get a bit of pine as well . the malt flavor is light , but it works well for this beer as it isnt overly hoppy . good balance . medium carbonation with a light body . perhaps a touch to much carbonation . but otherwise a nice body to compliment the beer . perfect drinkability . perfect . nothing more i can say .'

S"had this on tap at the toronado . super pale yellow hue . the pour yielded a thick white head that turned into some lacing . strong , spiced , bubble come aroma . man , you can smell that belgian yeast good . super smooth mouthfeel , kind of thick . tastes of citrus and malt , almost a bit like lemon grass , which seems to dominate at times . this beer kind of confuses me . it 's trying to achieve a few things all at once . it 's got the belgian aspect down , but then there 's that citrus thing going on . does this want the character of an american pale ale , too ? not even 1/4 of a way into it and i 'm already wanting my next beer . it comes off a bit like a super thick saison ."

S"had this one on tap at the copper mine pub 2nd anniversary party yesterday . appearance : poured a slightly murky traditional abbey dubbel burgandy with a small crown that displayed moderate retention . smell : lots of beautiful rich vanilla bourbon over a hint of belgian malt and sugar . taste : same as the nose but not as sweet ( thankfully ) . i find it to be incredibly flavorful and much better than two blind monks ( of which this is a bourbon barrel aged version of ) myself . mouthfeel : down right under carbonated which worked with the full flavored vanilla bourbon but it still detracted from my experience more than it enhanced it . the carbonation would barely pass for a cask sample and simply does n't for a tap version . drinkability : a challenge due to the mouthfeel . improve the mouthfeel while retaining the delicious flavor and you 've got yourself a world class brew brian !"

S"2008 vintage , standard 22oz bomber . i wish i could bring myself to like this beer , but i ca n't . the alcohol muddles all of the fruit flavors , and the hops are way out of control ( out of control not in a hop-bomb kind of way , but in a sickly sweet alpha acid juice kind of way ) . way too young to drink . definitely needs some age on it . could be a great beer in the future , but right now i 'm not a fan ."

S"sampled 09jul2004 a translucid amber ale , with very shy but fluffy head that somehow survived through most of the pint . most of the time i ca n't detect much odor at first from the pints i sample at ddc , because cigarette smoke totally screws with my nose . i have to drink at least 1/3 of it and really stick my nose and mouth in the pint in order to pick up anything . but not this time . if you want to know how this beer smells , go to your kitchen right now , crack a few whole black pepercorns , rub them on your hands and place them underneath your nose and mouth . incredible . i can barely believe a beer can smell like this without grinding pepper in your glass before pouring it , so i stare down the bottom of my pint every time i have this to see if i can spot any pieces of pepper . nope . the pepery taste starts off mellow enough , and seems to gain a little steam , going from the tip of your tongue at first and spreading across your tongue after a few sips . it reaches a plateau when you 're half way through your pint , and never gets to a level where non-spicy food lovers ca n't take it anymore . unfortunately , the spicyness blocks out any other tastes . i gave this beer a slightly below average 2.5 for drinkability , because in most cases , half a pint is enough to satisfy your curiosity , and i 'm pretty sure no one orders more than one pint of this per evening . however , in a different context , say in the dead of winter , or to complement thai or szechuan food , i 'd gladly have more than one ."

S"oh my god , you cant even see through it ! now this is a stout ! first taste was like an uber concentrated form of guinness extra . bitter as f $ # ^ ! in fact , i felt the effects of the alcohol about three sips into it . then it hit my yacking mechanism . i could n't even finish it halfway . god i feel like a prick . wasted such a good beer on a drain pour , but it was just undrinkable to the max . overwhelming flavors topped with alcohol that seemed like there was 5 shots of rum in it . maybe i 'm not ready for a real beer , or the other beers i had earlier in the day maxed out my consumption for the day . i 'll start with this next time because it was just beautiful beer . darkest i 've ever seen with a head that filled a hefe glass with just a 12 oz bottle . suprised that the lacing was n't that heavy . very well done on the appearance , but drinkability ? horrid . do n't get me wrong , the taste is awesome in about 200 different ways , but blah ! feels like you have to choke it down , and that makes it completely un-enjoyable ."

S"popped open a bottle while decorating the christmas tree . wanted to make sure and try the limited ( though i am not sure how limited ) beer celebrating 400th anniversary of the founding of quebec as i am a fan of many of unibroue 's other beers . unfortunately , i did not find the beer worthy of the occasion it was meant to celebrate . the beer pours a hazy , honey yellow . the small head subsides fairly quickly . the smell of yeast dominates , reminding me of fresh bread . their are faint citrus and banana notes as well . the yeast dominates the nose . the carbonation is fairly high , though not to the level of duvel . as for taste , much as with the smell , the yeast dominates . there is a slight spicyness , but overall the taste is very subtle and very dry . the beer is quite drinkable , mainly as there are no strong flavors to act as a deterrent . it is not sweet and flavors are very subtle . alcohol is strong - not absurdly so - but well hidden . i wonder if this beer might be better paired with food than drunk on its own ? in conclusion , quatre centieme is an enjoyable beer , but certainly nothing memorable . i was slightly disappointed , but mainly because of how much i enjoy la fin du monde , chambly noire , terrible and other unibroue brews ."

S"i had a bottle of the `` end of world '' at coasters downtown draughthouse in elizabeth city . it was served with a goblet . i had a good impression of this beer from the getgo . it has that champagne type foil around the top of the bottle . i compare this in the beerworld as wearing a suit to work . after the pour , it sat in the glass very proudly . the head was white and frothy , about a finger and a half tall . the color was great for this style of belgian ; gold and cloudy . it smelled just as good as it looked . just as i expected , sweet smelling malts . almost fruity , let 's say a blend of peach and honeydew with a splash of bubblegum . the next smell of it let some of the alchohol out but it was not overbearing . it 's more of a shy warning for what 's to come . now for tasting ... i was not disappointed by the taste . the high alchohol ( 9 % ) did not overpower the beer . i could not tell i was drinking only 91 % beer . that 's what the high score is for because i 've had other belgian style beers that tasted like i was drinking a mix drink . although , beware : this is a sipper , not a gulper . when i took a large gulp to gauge mouthfeel , it was too much . alchohol attacked my tongue and throat on the way down . besides that , when sipping it feels velvety in the mouth . as far as drinkability goes , i gave it a 3.5 even though i wanted another one after i was finished with it . but since its 9 % abv , it was not a good idea to have another because i had a long drive ahead of me . good beer ."

S'this will be my second time sampling this strange brew . i have to admit that last time i was not too impressed , but i figured it deserved a second chance . not sure as to when this was bottled . pours an extremely thick black color , with no heading , but a milk chocolate brown rim is at the top of the glass . aroma is outstanding , and unlike any other beer i have smelled . i get traces of chocolate , burning kindling , rum soaked raisins , vanilla and alcohol . taste starts off incredibly juicy ( chocolate covered cherries ? ) followed by chocolate and smoke , and finally ending on a heavy coffee aftertaste . this stuff has the ability to permeate out the sinuses to the point that you can taste this beer for hours to come . mouthfeel is slick and heavy , resembling a port or sherry . drinkability i would say is up to whoever is tasting it , but for me , this bottle was all to easy to finish . this is one hell of an interesting brew , and one that i am glad i tried again . i was especially surprised that there was little to no alcohol burn . i can only imagine what this brew tasted like when it was new . either way , worth at least a try . cheers'

S"alright this is my honest review of the the 2006 edition . no other freshness indicator exists on the bottle . appearance : cloudy , peach-like color ( almost looks fuzzy from the haze ) . i 'll say that this is kinda interesting , but it is this beer 's only good aspect . small head development recedes to a ring . smell : this really puts me off , which it took me awhile to gin up the ability to consume this over-spiced beast . `` holiday '' spices , sour-apple and alcohol vapors define the overwhelming nose . taste & mouthfeel : i do n't think these kind of spiced winter warmers do it for me and this is definitely my least favorite . full , warming body with moderate level of carbonation . the wheat malt character is evident as it adds banana and phenol qualities . yep . all the spices are there too , coriander , orange peel , nutmeg , and cinnamon ( also vanilla beans , but that is hard to pick out of the label listed spices ) . drinkability : excuse me ... yeck ! i made it only about eighty-percent of the way through before draining the remainder ."

S"got this bottle in a trade . been waiting to try this one for a while . thanks beachrez ! 2009 vintage . 12oz bottle ... a : a murky caramel color with absolutely no head . decent . s : i get a nice floral hop blended perfectly with a great sugary malt upfront . some toffee / caramel in the middle with some faint apple on the backend . very good . t : floral hops upfront quickly settled by sweet caramel malts and some booze bite . iced tea quickly follows . this almost tastes like a sweet and hoppy long island iced tea . i like this brew . good . m : thick body with an awesome carbonation . very good . d : the drinkability on this is incredible . i feel like i 'm just drinking iced tea . no booze wall at all ! for 11.5 % ? that 's incredible . perfect . all in all , this is a solid brew . glad i got to try this one . at a year old , this is drinking awesome ! if you like barleywines , hops , and enjoy iced tea , then this is sure to please . good beer ."

S"this poured an opaque dark brown with lots of tan head . it smelled terrible , like rubbing alcohol and burnt coffee . it tasted bad too , like old coffee and burnt bananas . it was nicely thick with slight carbonation , but it had a bad bitter coffee aftertaste . overall this was one of the worst porters i 've ever had . might have been skunked - need to try this again to see if it 's really as good as everyone else thinks . especially since i loved the other arcadia brews ."

S'pours a cola colored brownish hue with copper highlights . less than one finger of head after the pour , but leaves some film that slowly recedes to nothing . crip toasted and light roasted malt nose that smells very sessionable . roasted malts mix very well with the toasted malts and balancing grassy hops . the finish is just a little metallic when its too cold . let this beer warm up just a bit , and you have a great session dunkel .'

S"extra special thanks go out to beerman207 for cracking this bottle from 2006 ! this is the second of the schlafly reserves that i 've had and i 've been very impressed by both -- this brewery is really growing on me as i find their standard offerings to be very solid and enjoyable as well . the review is from notes taken on 6/25/2010 and poured from the bottle to a pint glass . appearance : pours a murky cider-like color mixed with some caramel brown ; starts with an off-white head that fades immediately to nothing other than a thin , uneven , and incomplete skim ; body is very murky and has some floaties in it ; only a few spots of lacing are left behind . smell : wonderful and nice deep and chewy caramel maltiness with a bit of of a warm spiciness to it ; a bit of a grainy and woody vanilla oakiness to it and a nice bourbony alcohol scent . taste : quite a bit going on here ; lots of the caramel maltiness mixes in with an acidic green apple and cinnamon flavors ; a definite presence of alcohol that is faintly warm and bourbonesque , but actually quite smooth and mellow . mouthfeel : body is fairly heavy , and it 's a little syrupy ; the carbonation is still quite present , which is surprising for a bottle that 's 4 years old , and comes across as foamy , soft and smooth and it really keeps the beer lively . drinkability : moderate at best because of the high abv and weight to this one , but the robust flavors and scents are really outstanding and it drinks pretty smoothly ."

S"this is the second time trying cane & ebel . have n't been impressed either time . cane & ebel gets off to a slow start . it pours a dark , very dark , copper red . head hangs around for a few seconds before disappearing into nothingness . lacing is non-existent . very sweet , malty , and a bit of rye in the nose . no hops at all here . the same can be said about the taste . sweet tasting with a hint of hops and rye on the end . this bottle is still in date , so i 'm a little confused as to where all the hops have gone . perhaps it 's the thai palm sugar that i 'm not liking , but this is way to sweet to be considered a hopped up red ale . mouthfeel is thin and this beer feels a bit under carbonated . wo n't be having anymore of these thanks . i 'll stick to founders & terrapin for my red ale needs ."

S"appearance - clear yellow color with fluffy 1 finger head that disappeared rather quickly . some lacing on glass smell - skunky taste - crisp and nice bite from the noble hops . mouthfeel - ok drinkability - perhaps the skunkiness was just due to the fact i bought this as a single out of the fridge at the liquor store . it is somewhat nice to drink . this was the first beer i had back when i was 16 years old and have n't had one since 1993 until i went back for a revisit . it actually is not a bad beer and some respectable flavorings . i 'm glad i went back for a revisit ."

S"sampled at bailey 's taproom on 5/28/09 , reviewed from notes , color is a pale golden yellow straw , inch soapy white head , some retention but no lacing , aroma had faint hops , bit of skunkiness , grain , lemons , bread , and barley , flavor has some dry hop flavors at first , then toasted malts in the middle , finish has a good amount of both lemon and oranges , this beer is quite crisp and refreshing with a very light overall flavor , weak and slightly dry mouthfeel , thin bodied , strong level of carbonation , could drink a lot of this brew as there is not much to it , thirst quenching , would go nicely in the spring and summer which it is targeted at as being a seasonal , very light , goes down with ease , would skip next time , looking forward to trying others from this brewery in the future though"

S"upland o'fest a 3-3.5 light amber , clear as it should be , short head vanishes to a wispy cap . lace does not look likely . s 2 strong alcohol smell . some toasted malts are in there somewhere , but this is not very close to any ideal oktoberfest aroma that i 'm familiar with . nor is it good regardless of style , unless you like the smell of isoprophyl in the morning . am i going to go blind if i drink this ? t 2-2.5 tastes like an amped up lawnmower beer , which makes no sense imo , with a little toasted malt thrown in for good measure . the thin flavor profile allows the alcohol to take too much of the spotlight , though there is what seems to be significant leafy hop bitterness in the finish . m 3 mouthfeel is the least of this beer 's concerns . d 1.5 had never heard of upland before . wishing i still had n't ."

S"wow , look at that abv in this suff ! no wonder they call this wild blue ! how wild will this be my mouth ? on to the beer : at first pour , it looks like a belgian lambic . the color of the head is light violet , which forms nicely , and the body is a mix of brown and violet . there is a subtle blueberry note in the smell with a side of dms ( cooked veggies ) . and now , the wild blue will be unleased on my palate ... yikes ! the first thing you can feel on the palate is the intense alcohol . man , this is almost like trying to drink cough syrup . i can surely feel the booze warm my throat . the blueberry is there , but so are characteristcs of a natural ice . mouthfeel is very thick , cloying to a point . you ca n't drink this one down , you have to sip on it slowly . it was n't as rancid as i was expecting . actually , the blueberry flavoring helped out a lot , but still way too boozy . still , it 's hard to believe this is n't a sparks alcoholic energy drink ."

S"pours a clear , slightly crimson golden color with a nice big white head . pine and resin hop comes strongly off the nose with a nice malt balance . smells really nice actually . the taste is a sweet malt balance to those same pine and resin hops . the original bite of the pine hops comes off almost fruity , but also with a hint of booze . not as sweet as some dipas , which is welcome . mouthfeel has good carbonation and some residual sweetness that hangs out on the tongue . overall is a 5.0 with the bump because it is a $ 4 bomber . i mean , $ 4 , seriously ? this is not nearly the best iipa i 've ever had , but it has really nice pine flavor , is $ 4 and is much better than the attempts of a ton of different breweries attempt to make a decent iipa ."

S"thanks , shane . lust pours a dark muddy brown , and once in the glass it 's turbid and opaque with a well-retaining tan head . pretty mild on the nose , brett leaves some signature funk , and the cherries are noticeable too without being terribly bold or complex . not much bourbon barrel character , though there is a bit of brown sugar , faint belgian yeast and a dark malt foundation . not much to this , perhaps it was better fresh . the palate opens with dark candi sugar , raisins , dried cherries . there 's a mild brett influence , but it 's drowned by flavors of molasses and anise . finishes oaky , phenolic with a barely perceptible note of bourbon . pretty good , certainly not amazing ."

S'appearance - 2.0 a firm pour yeilds a very thin white head that instantly all but disappears . light blonde in colour with great clarity . smell - 2.5 very little aroma to speak of , but very clean , a little corn , slightly sweet . taste - 3.0 very clean and crisp , with just a hint of softness that suggests that it is an ale , not a lager . light grain and husk flavour , low to moderate bitterness lingers nicely , finishes dry . mouthfeel - 3.0 low carbonation , could definitely stand to be more lively , but goes down quite smoothly . drinkability - 4.0 certainly sessionable , this would be a great bbq beer , although certainly not interesting enough for enthusiasts to come back to . overall - 2.8 how this won a gold at the aiba i will never know . admittedly there is not much wrong with it , but there is very little right with it either . it could be easily mistaken as one of the better australian or european macro lagers . sad that gage roads is having to resort to this kind of tasteless beer to save their own hides .'

S"brown with an orangey pink hue , thin white head that dissapates quickly . a variety of smells to pick out ... vanilla , a vague smoked oaky smell , brown sugar slight fig/prune smell , and a sort of sweet acidic tomato smell ( sounds gross but that the best way i can describe it ) . vanilla , and maple flavors are strongest , followed by a fruitiness that while rich is not overpowering . i do n't know if i can really taste much in the way of hops , though there 's a little in there , judging from the slight bitterness , but lack of hop character . very warming and alcoholic a the finish . pretty full mouthfeel . overall drinkability takes a hit because it 's a little too sweet and because 3/4 of a glass is enough for me . i feel like this is more suited for a brandy snifter than a pint glass , as i would be more inclined to drink this by the oz . than by the pint . this is one of the few beers that i feel is better with food than standing alone . a good dessert pairing . i 'd like to try to cook the alcohol out of this sometime and drizzle it on a dessert , like pie or something . this beer is n't killer or anything , but i applaud dogfish head for their innovation . note : this was aged about half a year ."

S"my second birracao session- a year since the first- was a fantastical ocasion to re-evoke this taste i once fell in love with but for geographical reasons and much like any other european girl i 've met ( flesh and bones , these ones ) , had to abandon . this time we went along prepared . chilled to a perfect temperature . a side dish of gouda cheese . pour was probably the most neutral bit about it . simple , dark skinned like a milk chocolate with a 1cm head dissipating eventually but giving of an oh-so-good smell of chocolate mixed with hops . is it a cerveza de chocolate or a chocolate de cerveza ? you could think this one through for hours . the taste was , again , too good . one is unaware what dominates . the chocolate predominates the early stages making you feel you just drank a cold cup of hot cocoa but , muck like the nose-experience , the remainder overwhelms with a light-skinned beer feel , slightly malty at first ( although it 's hard to explore this since the buds are busy with the cacao ) then rushes into the bitter scene . it 's not too sweet , either- the chocolate can be very well controlled . see below . mouthfeel is rather nice . the density is not too short to make it seem too lager-like , but not too high to make it seem cocoa-like . it 's perfectly balanced , like say a brown ale . drinkability is hard to assess . this beer could well be a dessert , on its own . it 's quite strong and the sweetness can only last you as long as one , maximum two of these in a row or maybe in a week . whilst the cheese alowed to neutralise the mouthfeel between sips , one must be careful because one can go from love to hate on the second or third consecutive beer . it 's a rare gem not to be abused of ."

S"put this bottle next to another 11.2 oz bottle and tell me it 's not a midget.. i truly think the t'smisje brewery is lying about their beer size.. but that 's another issue , and one i can send a nasty email about when i perfect my belgian . pours a murky belgian brown/red.. no lacing , really no head either . nose draws alot of sweet liquor , wood , vanilla and pepper out of those casks . age has pushed the aroma here into the green apple/cidery realm , creating an atmosphere of nervousness and foreboding daunting tasks.. very smooth beer flavorwise . vanilla custard and brandy milkshake ... like bailey 's , this goes down smooth but carries an uncompromising weight and alcohol warmth that can not help but limit consumption , an interesting treat.. not worth 6 $ for 10 oz and probably not something i 'd buy again ... but im glad i tried it . the dulle teve reserva is along these lines with deeper depth and more vibrant expression to it ."

S"my last review was dfh 90 minute . this # 10 for my 100th review seemed fitting . on april 10th , which is the 100th day of the year . i 'm all about seizing opportunity . thanks to superfantastic for the idea . this is the first quad that i have had the opportunity to try . i 've enjoyed rochefort 's other offerings , and i am sure that this will be no different . the first thing that i am struck by is how eagerly the ivory head developed in my snifter . ( i wanted to enjoy the big nose that i am expecting ) . it 's retaining and lacing very nicely as well . to say that the head is developing its own landscape is an understatement . rugged mounds of froth are basically doing what they please in a tectonic display of power . there are little nuggets of yeast floating around , despite my careful pour . that 's a little bit of a turn off , but no major problem . nose is dominated by sweetness . there are only subtle hop qualities . as it warms up i am getting butterscotch , and other toffy like aromas . much more pronounced than i am used to . there 's definitely a fresh baked rye bread aroma , almost salty . very very interesting . as for the taste , the hops are on the light side , yet present . i also get the flavor of prunes and phenols . spicy , peppery , and the taste of buttered dark multigrain bread . you know , the kind with rolled oats on top ? there are fruity qualities . there 's a very hearty food-like quality to this beer . it 's incredible . i 've never experienced anything like it . warming in the mouth , the throat , stomach ... the feel of this beer is sublime . it 's like what angels would feel like if , somehow , you could drink them . full bodied , this is one of the softest beers i have ever had in my mouth . the drinkability is going to score a little lower , because this beer is really intense . drinkability over the period of a week or a year ? incredible . drinkability over the period of a single night ? um ... .less . notes : my experience with beeradvocate.com is literally shaping who i am as a human being . i ca n't wait for the next 100 , and i ca n't think of a better beer to celebrate my centennial . # 10 is one of those that i have always wondered about , and now will always think of longingly . what an excellent beer . thank god for the catholic church , and for putting men in monasteries for so long that they literally had no choice but to create"

S"22oz bomber with no best by date . beer served in tulip glass . appearance : crystal clear copper color - well into the red/orange side of that color . bubbles moving up slowly through the beer . off-white 1/4 '' head initially that dies down to a ring around the edge and a thin film in the middle . plenty of persistent lacing ( sheets , strands ) as i drank it down . a very good looking beer . smell : grapefruit citrus mostly , with maybe something a little piney in the back . with a good swirl in the tulip i also get more pine and floral and less grapefruit . taste : very much like a american double india pale ale ( dipa ) , except the grapefruit citrus is more blended with a rich malt that brings along some caramel and other sweetness to balance the citrusy hops . alcohol is well hidden to non-existent in taste - a dangerous brew indeed . i think this beer could create the wicked rather than punish them . mouthfeel : quite thick and smooth , but the hop oils stick a bit to the teeth . carbonation is fleeting - it 's on the tongue briefly and then gone . drinkability : if i had to make a recommendation , i think the hops need to be more german-like ( crisper ) . i remember having this beer another time and it was more like a helles lager . this time it 's more like a dipa . so for the price i ca n't see myself getting it again , but i did enjoy it . maybe with the right meal i 'd enjoy it more . plus i 'm glad i split the beer - i ca n't see myself finishing a whole one by myself . great looking beer though , so i 'll give it that ."

S"i had a really hard time with this beer because it is so very true to the style description but i had a really hard time drinking this on its own . was really wishing i had some strong cheese or some roasted pork with leeks a - deep mahogony with a khaki head that is thick and fizzy . stickier than i thought it would be and leaves beautiful lacing . the head fades to a 1/4-inch cap and stays for the whole beer . an incredibly attractive brew s - apple cider with light vinegar and sour cherries . some clove-like spice that adds to the apple cider aroma . t & m - very spritzy carbonation that is quite nice in feel . livens this beer up a bit and gives it a light , non-syrupy body . i instantly taste fresh mulled apple cider and think of a fall county fair . sour cherry notes and then hit hard by slightly bitter vinegar . not harsh to the tastebuds , but man is that interesting . i can definitely appreciate the flavors here . no hop bitterness and not much malt i do n't think . d - definitely a sipper , but again i had a hard time drinking the whole thing . would have been much better with some food ."

S"pours a deep red to burgundy color , fairly dark , not much light can be seen through it , but enough to see some sediment . a fair half inch of head results from the pour . smells of sweet cherries , some malts , and alcohol . that 's about it . as in the smell , there is a strong tart cherry taste with sweetness . spicy belgian yeast flavors are tucked behind some malt , pungent cinnamon and booze . the dominant alcoholic- cherry flavor tastes medicinal and reminds me somewhat of cough syrup , it 's a little too much . medium bodied and highly carbonated and crisp . i do n't find this beer to be very drinkable . honestly , it does n't go down too easy for me , but it is more of a sipping beer to enjoy over the course of an hour . i bought a 4 pack and did n't drink the last beer until a month and a half later . a good beer to try , but i do n't think i 'll be buying it again ."

S"poured from a 7oz . bottle ( stamped 6lq ) into a snifter . $ 14/six at schnuck 's - surprised to see a barley wine there and had n't yet tried one , so here goes ! appearance : pours an amber color with no head whatsoever . my first thought as it came out of the bottle was 'syrupy ' . a casual observer might think i 'm enjoying a snifter half full of brandy . smell : rum raisin . sweets . plums . the aroma was present as soon as i cracked the bottle . alcohol is certainly present . taste : more mild than the smell indicates ... a bit of hop bitterness and a touch of alcohol . faint raisin flavor . i 'm enjoying the flavor more and more as it warms . it leaves my mouth feeling a little dry . mouthfeel : almost no carbonation . feels more like scotch in my mouth than beer , just without the alcohol burn . drinkability : it 's definitely a beer to sip slowly , but i could probably put down 2 or 3 of these small bottles in an evening . all in all , i 'd call my first encounter with a barley wine a pleasant one , but it was n't what i was expecting . i think i started drinking it too cold , as it really mellows and becomes a nice smooth drink as it warms . i could really see myself enjoying this during a cold illinois winter ."

S"poured a clear golden straw color with a small to medium off-white head that receded down to a skim that stayed to the end . patches of lacing were left all around the glass . bready malt aroma is the first noticed followed by a hint of citrus and spice . pretty straightforward on taste - wheat grain , some lemon , spice , and bitter hops . light bodied ( which is probably what they were after since this is a summer beer ) with a dry finish . drinkability is high due to the light body and subdued flavor . there 's nothing about this beer that 's going to knock your socks off , but i think it will make a good summer time session beer ."

S"a couple of bucks for a 650 ml bottle of brown ale pushing 6 % abv ... . wow ! if you 've got a tj 's near you , stock up on this one ! no , it 's not a hallmark of the style , let alone a ba top beer ... it 's a p4p king , though . enjoy it warmer than average , and do n't mind waiting a month or so before cracking it open . some age does it well . a- poured freely into a highball glass . the foamy top fades away into a white ring and some bubbles . standard brawn ale . mahogany at the edges where the light barley passes through . a- not exciting , some roasted malt . kinda like chocolate . t- starts off like a neutral pale ale , a little sweet , then some caramel and chocolate , and then a slight burnt roast finish . less roast than an irish red ale , but a smooth dark chocolate flavor pervades . some balanced hop finish , very finely done . usually i think of brown ales as excessively sweet , or some screwball throws a curve ball and hops the hell out of it . this utilizes hops masterfully . finsihes dry , but sweetens and develops character as it warms . m- kinda thin . there 's enough from the specialty malts to make up for the thin-mouthfeel . and for a beer so strong , it 's nice that it finishes dry and drinks easy . i tear apart beers i consider to have attenuated poorly ... especially the self-righteous ones ... in this case , to be fair , this beer is too lean . a little more substance and depth of flavored are call for . o- more of a journeyman than contender this beer still manages to punch above its weight . for those unfamiliar w/ craft beers this is a great gateway brew . it 's also a nice and dependable break from so many of the heavy-hitters on the market . a brown ale does n't have to be cloyingly sweet and enormously complex , so i like that this is a toned down beer . that said , it feels like they found something that satisfies style guidelines while remaining unadventurous and just decided to dial it in ."

S"i drink this beer about every other day , so i think i have enough credentials to at least review it , though i may be slightly biased . in philly bars , all you have to say is `` lager '' and you get one of these . it pours a nice amber with a sort-of-white head that dissipates in under a minute . upon first taste , you get what i used to call the `` yuengling taste , '' which i have sinced learned ( from a tour of the brewery in pottsville ) is corn . it 's the only beer that i 've had , to my knowledge , that uses corn as an ingredient . inexperienced beer drinkers tend not to like this taste . you can pick up the corn in the aroma as well , but it is n't overpowering . this is a real easy-drinking beer and very refreshing when you need one . yuengling traditional lager will always be my `` default beer .

S'12oz bottle poured into snifter ; thanks to jesse13713 for this one ! a : pours a dark brown/black with a finger of brown foamy head , which dissipates moderately quickly without leaving lacing . really amazed at how dark this given the low abv ; i would have expected something approaching double digits before checking on here , just from the appearance . s : lots of blueberry aroma here , tons of roasted chocolate , almost charred malts , with accents of wood , smoke , and vanilla . as the beer approaches room temperature it smells almost like blueberry juice . t : again , roasted chocolate malts provide the backbone for taste , at least in the front of the sip . blueberry dominates the middle- not sure if i can pick anything else up beyond a bit of chocolate , and blueberry lingers for quite a while on the finish . at warmer temperatures the blueberry gains a tangy , almost bitter quality , which knocks taste down a bit . m : much like appearance , this is very good for a 4.5 % stout . medium-bodied and very smooth , with light carbonation and a bit of a stickiness left over on the finish . d : a mostly hit or miss beer across its individual categories , the blueberry intensity here ( without a great flavor to back it up ) was just too much for this one to go down easily at all .'

S'i drank this from a 22 oz bottle into my rochefort chalice . the beer is very clear medium straw , hardly distinguishable from any other farm or lager . the head is about a finger , gone quickly with decent retention . the aroma is ok , nothing outstanding with light hops and flowers . the taste is better than i thought after the aroma , but once again nothing to distinguish itself as a great , it is what it is . there is light hoppiness with flowers . the beer is really watery but easily drinkaable . overall this to me is just a little more pricey sessional , nothing special'

S"first review in quite a while ... this beer was highly anticipated by the likes of me , as it 's a wheatwine ( a style of particular interest ) brewed by my favorite american brewery . unfortunately , i think it 's going to need at least a year in the cellar before it lives up to its potential . appearance : fairly standard wheatwine look , poured from a 12-ounce bottle into my weyerbacher tulip . very nearly opaque orangeish gold , with a thick , creamy head that vanishes after a few minutes . this beer essentially looks just the way it should . smell : honestly , a 3.0 may be generous here . wheaty funk combines with a dry , powdery yeastiness and a stiff alcoholic note to produce a somewhat off-putting effect . the nose does warn you with regard to what 's in store when you sip the beer , though -- i find the smell-to-taste correlation to be close to 100 % . taste : matches the nose almost completely , as noted above . poured fresh , the beer 's flavor profile explodes in the mouth and does not unwind during and after the swallow -- it 's as if every component of the beer 's flavor hits you at once , giving you no time to tease things apart . wheat is , as expected , at the forefront , but not in the mild , pleasant form found in hefeweizens . this stuff is a blast of wheaty funk , chalky yeast , overwhelming phenolic cloves , and moderate alcoholic burn . with some imagination , i might catch a fleeting hint of fermented apricots or peaches , but that could be all in my mind . mouthfeel : as wheatwines go , this one delivers as expected , with a well-carbonated , relatively viscous feel . the powdery yeastiness renders the palate quite dry , and the alcohol is prominent enough to warm the throat as it goes down . in my view , this is currently the beer 's strong suit . drinkability : i feel guilty giving a weyerbacher brew a drinkability rating this low , but i have to . it 's hard to finish a bottle of this stuff right now . it 's a sipper at best , and this is one style that really does n't benefit as the beer 's temperature increases . as such , the glass becomes more challenging to finish as i take the breaks needed to contemplate each successive sip . here 's the thing : in my experience , most wheatwines benefit drastically from a year or two of aging , and i expect great things from weyerbacher fourteen in 2011 and/or 2012 . when the time comes , i 'll re-review this beer , and the scores will most likely improve dramatically . i 'm thinking of terrapin gamma ray in particular when forming my"

S"2002 bottling pours a delicious , deep red with some lacing around the outside , the sort of beautiful color that leaves me eager to skip straight to quaffing . smell is huge in the alcohol department , sweet floral notes as well . taste is a sweetish , fruit medly with a puckering alcohol aftertaste , remiding me more of west-coast style barleywines . i 've had beers that stand much higher abv-wise , but none of them were a punch in the mouth like this is . sweetness fades as the flavor settles into a slightly acidic , port-like finish that lingered longer than i 'd expected it to . mouthfeel on this brew was very thick and syrupy , resembling thin cough syrup . i disliked this aspect of the beer . drinkability was very low for me because of the alcohol punch , and the almost-sickly sweet mouthfeel . i split this bottle with a friend , and that seemed just right , i ca n't imagine enjoying more than that in a sitting . i can see this beer aging really well , and i 'd want to experiment with that , the two-year mark was a little aggressive for my tastes , but i can see through that to a remarkable beer in another year or two . i 'll definitely have another ... just not tonight ."

S'22 ounce brown bomber dated best-before july 27th 2007 . pours transparent copper with three-quarters inch of white head plus light lacing . smells like sweet biscuit malt with a bit of caramel and fresh green hops . flavor features gently toasted sweet caramel malts with balancing leafy hop notes . crisp , too-light , and over-bubbly body . not a lot going on here , but the beer is clean and quite refreshing on a hot day . a decent entry level beer for beginners and a good lawn-mower drink for the rest of us .'

S"belikin stout is probably the # 2 beer in belize , after `` regular '' belikin . invariably served in the same brown bottle as its lighter bwudda , with 6.5 % alcohol vs. 4.8 % for regular . distinguished by the blue cap vs. the green cap . aroma from the bottle is negligible . malts and hops are well blended for an uncomplicated but delicious flavor . mouthfeel is delightfully smooth , with enough body to distinguish it as a stout without being at all chewy . it goes down astonishingly easy . drinkability is exceptional ."

S"on tap woodshop classix anaheim , ca clear golden and orange with a soapy , frothy white head . dots of lace down the glass . though , unfortunately , the beer stopped impressing here . an incredible and overwhelming lavender explosion , and little to nothing else . honestly , this smells like a bathroom ( in a sterile , lavender , grandma sort of way ) . yes , i understand this is a lavender ale , but this is overpowering and somewhat shocking . points for creativity ? more grandma 's bathroom lavender in the flavor as well with just a hint of sourness , but nothing at all shines through except the initial lavender . light to medium bodied . this was not this beer 's downfall . i suppose for a lavender ale , this one hits a homerun ! but as any sort of beer drinking experience , this is no good ."

S"pours a pretty deep dark burnt orange . it actually has a pretty decent amount of head for the style , and the foam laces really well . smells like a boatload of spices . cinnamon 's the main one , with allspice , cloves , nutmeg , and a surprising strong liquorice/anise smell even though i do n't believe it contains any . not much in the way of beer or pumpkins , though . the flavor mirrors the smell . lots of cinnamon and anise , but as a beer , i 'm just getting a ton of spice . if that 's what you want - this one is pretty much the king of heavily spiced pumpkin beers . if you are n't into that - beware . the body of the beer 's great , and pretty ideal for the style . for me , the first 1/3 of the glass was great . after that , it was like drinking liquid spice mix . definitely a splitter . hmmmm . lots of talk about this being among the best pumpkin ales . i really enjoyed their great pumpkin at the gabf ... but this is all spice and very little else . i have to think that night owl might be a bit overhyped . lots of people whine about overspiced pumpkin beers , but this beer ( the most spiced one of them all ) seems to be getting a free pass . worth a shot , and good up-front , but it 'll let you down pretty quickly . ( it might be worth noting that this was contract brewed at new belgium ... not sure if there 's any difference between this batch and the ones brewed in seattle )"

S'calling this an i.p.a . is ridiculous . everything about the flavor says barleywine . it has that characteristic buttery fruit aroma common in barleywines and it was surprisingly not hoppy given the name . sweet and alcoholic and definitely best in small doses . it was odd to look at it next to the 60 and 90 minute . the 60 was by far the palest but the 90 seemed just a hair darker than the 120 and had a better head .'

S"2000 vintage the wrap says contents under pressure , so it 's obviously supposed to be carbonated . mine , however , is completely flat which knocked it down in several categories . black as night . looks thick and syrupy , but has no head or carbonation at all . aroma is heavy of molasses and i do n't care for that aroma or taste . alcohol is readily evident . there is a dark fruit character to the aroma which is nice . taste : again big on the molasses . behind the molasses flavor is dark roasted malts with some bitter chocolate and coffee notes . alcohol not hidden . slight dark fruit character . slightly sour . full body . heavy and syrupy . might have been exceptional with some carbonation present . drinkability : i 'd be happy to never have this beer again , although i am curious what it would be like with some carbonation . overall , i did n't care for this beer at all . the taste , aroma , and lack of carbonation remind me of sam adams triple bock which i 'm not fond of either ."

S"pours a very dark reddish brown with red/orange highlights , with a thick , creamy beigish head . five minutes later , i 've yet to take a sip but the head remains -- great retention . smell gives a hop spiciness , with a strong malty base behind it . hints of alcohol in the scent almost stings the nose . am i worthy ? the bottle suggests i am not . first sip hits hard initially ... hard to tell if its the malt , hops , or alcohol . it all kinds of comes at once . it finishes surprisingly clean . second sip , i realized how balanced the flavor is . hard to isolate the parts i thought i identified in the smell , but i 'm sure its all there . the maltiness really comes through on the back of the tongue , and i think the hops come through a spicy bitterness ( not `` hot '' spicy , but they seem to be something other than just bitter -- for some reason , spicy is the only word i can come up with ) . nice full mouthfeel . certainly nothing watery or light about it . surprisingly drinkable given how intense the smell is , but do n't know if i 'd be having more than one or two in a night . i do n't have the regular arrogant bastard handy for comparison , but i believe if i had a choice between the two , i would choose the oaked version . something about the finish seems more mellow . very good , one i would definitely get again , but as i said not more than two in a night ."

S'poured from a 33cl bottle into a crystal brandy snifter . appearance : well , the first thing that i noticed was that the beer was extremely carbonated , i mean the beer literally sizzled in my glass . even with a slow pour it had a trememdous head that dissipated to a bone colored lace within a minute . the beer is the color of dark leather . smell : berry scents with a little spice ( clove ? ) can smell the alcohol , very , very appealing nose . taste : i can definately taste the alcohol in this one . i am actually getting a nice warming effect from this . a little chocolate perhaps ? some overripe fruit flavor . a good bit of sweetness for this one . mouthfeel : carbonation tingles the toungue . coats the palatte well , thick , but not too much so . drinkability : i want another , but more than that could be an issue with the high alcohol .'

S"this 'handcrafted ancient ale ' pours a mostly clear pale gold with no visible highlights and an effervescent white head . a little bit of lace remains and there are plenty of rising bubbles that cling sparingly to the inside of the glass . bright and very spicy with a good amount of herbal notes and a yeasty fruit character . spicy hops and the muscat grapes really comes through . hints of honey and pale malt make up the majority of the backbone . a bit of a fresh vinous quality as well . very appetizing . fruity and yeasty with a hint of metallic character and lots of spice . again very spicy with faint hops and slightly sweet pale malt . the grapes come through in the flavor as well but come across as more sour and vinous than sweet and fruity as the nose implied . a hint of booze it detectable along with a faint , spicy honey sweetness in the finish . tasty and unique . bright and crisp but not necessarily due to higher carbonation ; rather the flavor itself enhances the up-beat mouthfeel . otherwise the brew is smooth and medium bodied . a good deal of warmth is present along with a juicy finish that processes a bit of a metallic quality that somewhat mimics dryness . interesting and different to be sure ."

S"i had this on-tap at the victory brewery . a : pale straw color , very dense and cloudy . a lot of white lacing around the edges , but it does n't last long . s : cloves , spices , maybe a subtle hint of hops , but nothing overpowering . the yeast really steals the show out of everything , but at 9.5 % the alcohol will burn if you inhale too deeply . t & m : nice and rich -- very complex . layers of bread , cloves , allspice , honey and wildflower . this could easily be any hefeweizen with a little bit of mead thrown in . as it warmed , i got hints of candied ginger too . a lot going on as far as complexity , but the alcohol is always the lasting impression . overall -- not a bad beer . there are better tripels to be found ( most definitely from belgium ) , but for an american `` try '' -- not too bad . the alcohol really shows on the nose and palate and overwhelms what could be a great beer . i definitely could n't have more than one ( god forbid i ever try ... ) . victory usually does great stuff , but this is a little over-done . a simple decrease in alcohol from 9.5 % to maybe 8 % or 8.5 % , would make a world of difference ."

S"2003 - 3.5/4/3/3/2 2001 - ( likely bad cork ) 2/3/1/1/1 1999 - 3/3.5/2.5/2/2 i would love to try a more recent vintage of this beer for comparison , but i probably could n't justify buying it strictly out of curiosity . i have a suspicion that all three bottles are well past their peaks , so take this review with a grain of salt . furthermore , the '01 is terrible and almost certainly suffered from a corking issue . also , the cork on the '99 had staining on the top of the cork from the beer soaking through along one side . it does n't actually seem bad , certainly not like the '01 , but i want to note that for accuracy 's sake . at any rate , i gave the beer the benefit of the doubt and used my scores from the 2003 version . all of the beers poured motor oil black with very little to no head with a ring of lacing on the '03 , nothing on the '01 and a very thin ring on the '99 . the aroma was the best part of these beers . the '03 smells quite nice with lots of roasted malt , chocolate and coffee . the '01 smells distinctly off , and the '99 has some odd vinegar and brandy notes that do n't exactly improve things . the flavor is n't horrible but is n't great . there 's more alcohol heat than i would expect on a five year old beer and some alright big malt notes that already have a faded taste to them . the '01 tastes like old cardboard and rotten vegetables mixed with motor oil . the '99 has certainly lost character . there are some cardboard-vinegar notes but also some lingering roasted malt and brandy . the '03 has some carbonation left for the feel but ultimately comes off a bit thin and sticky . the '01 is water thin and makes me want to retch . the '99 still has very light carbonation but the off flavors just kill things . none of them are easy to drink . my girlfriend was horrified by her sips . i 'm valiantly trying to sip them , besides the '01 which is going down the drain , but it 's an uphill battle . i freely admit that this review will probably not be a good guide for bottles with less age on them , but i hope i can help convince everyone not to let this beer age as long as these bottles have . cork problems seem to be commonplace and it seems to be going downhill after only five years . maybe , it 's great at three years , but i do n't think that i would have loved this beer at any age ."

S'poured from a 18oz . bottle into a pint glass . the color is a dark reddish gold with a minimal amount of head and no lacing . the smell is a bit spicy with some nice cinnamon and brown sugar . the smell brings to mind breakfast which is of coarse from the cinnamon but there is a slight bread flavor as well . the taste is has a bit of a malt flavor at first . it has a bit of a creamy flavor that mixes with the spicy cinnamon , brown sugar and slight ginger flavor . this beer is medium bodied and is really easy drinking . it goes down well and is refreshing for a winter beer'

S"thanks to jdv and pintsized for sharing a-orange , amber tinge , slightly hazy s-citrus hop upfron with underlying eaethy yeast t-drying in mouth with grassy hay feel to go on top of hop taste and bitterness . earthy flavor underneath with grain malt . m-pretty smooth feel with decent carbonation d-probably would n't reach for another-maybe not my favorite style . enjoyed the beer mostly because of the added hop flavor ."

S"after cracking the widget and pouring into a guinness imperial pint glass , you get that perfect irish stout look : clear delineation between jet black beer and light tan head , about a 1/2 inch thick . there is n't much to the aroma , just some roasted malt , a little soapy . there is a little coffee taste and a little chocolate taste but neither is significant . taste is smooth and creamy with a clean finish . dry irish stouts are one of the more perfect beers when you plan to drink about ten of them . goes down light and easy ."

S'the beer pours a dark copper color with a light cream 1 finger head , a little lacing . the first thing that hits you is the sweet caramelized sugar smell with earthy hints of the oak . the beer tastes almost exactly as it smells , caramel and oak with the addition of some bitterness . even though it is bitter there is not a lot of hop flavor . the sweet alcohol flavor is strong , something i really never love in a beer . it goes down smooth and seems to be only lightly carbonated . the oak flavor is great and will keep me coming back but the strong alcohol flavor will keep me from having a session with this beer .'

S'12oz bottle into an alpine pint glass . thanks to huey782 for the awesome extra ! pours a pale orangish-copper hue with a scant head of spittle-colored , minute bubbles that retreat to a wisp of foam and leave a few smatterings of lacing along the inside of the glass . tropical fruits and sweetbread in the nose , with notes of banana , pineapple , and honeydew . very sweet and fragrant , bordering on floral but ultimately well-balanced with the doughy malts and yeast notes . honey-biscuit malt base with a twang of spicy , vegetal hops on the finish . tinge of sour whiskey mash on the finish lets you know the alcohol is working , while the yeast adds some fruitiness . malts are big and chewy on the palate , with a creaminess that plays well off the well-carbonated body . overall , a very solid altbier that leaves me wanting more with each sip -- this thing is going so fast that i could burn through a 750ml without even blinking .'

S"this is a much beefier and more gratifying pilsner than most . a : impressive head with moderate lacing , which i did not expect . s : the smell is really quite good . the hops are all over the nose ... this is one stop short of an ipa in this department , in fact , i would say i prefer the nose to the harpoon ipa , for example , by a longshot . t : underwhelming taste ... it 's obvious that sam adams used most of the hops too generate smell rather than flavor . pilsners are , by definition very light beers , so i suppose that as far as pilsners go , this is far above average , but i still think the taste could use more work ... there 's just a tiny bit of a cheap funk in here that needs to be gone , then i would rate it far better . this is the quintessential example of what is , very precisely , a `` mediocre '' beer . m : too carbonated . i realize this is meant to appeal to the masses , but i really wish there was less carbonation in this brew . d : let me tell you ... this stuff absolutely disappears upon hitting your stomach , likely due to the fact that it 's mostly water ... but , very drinkable . sam 's did a decent job with this but there 's room for improvement . getting rid of that slight `` skunkiness '' others have mentioned would instantly make this brew twice as good , in my opinion ."

S"thanks to ryan for bringing this rarity to the seaoffloydster tasting on march 28th . a belgian inspired strong dark ale aged in bourbon barrels with sour cherries and brettanomyces ... sounds in vein of a cuvee de tomme , i 'm excited to try this one and compare . wow , very dark color with hints of red on the sides and a thin ring around the glass . dark fruits , brown sugar , not as bretty as i thought this would be ... i could n't really detect much funk in this beer , or sour cherries . maple syrup , a lot of sweetness , toasted malts and hints of chocolate . smells really good for a belgian strong dark so i 'll give it that , but the brett and sour cherry components were just not there as i thought they would be . no off aromas to hint at what i 'm about to taste . harsh upfront and somewhat oxidized , sweet malts and fruits in the middle , then an astringent god-awful flavor . a bit metallic in the end as well . was this a bad bottle ? could have been but the aroma was n't bad so i have my doubts . if i ever get a chance to try this again i will update this but this beer was a disappointment , glad i got to try it though . medium carbonation . could n't get through all of my sample ."

S'i generally do not review psuedo-micros such as this , but since my bosses were buying the pitcher , i thought some good should come out of it . the beer does look very impressive ... deep amber coloring with a nice frothy head that lingered for quite some time . however , the nice looks only go so far , the beer has minimal aroma a sugary caramely sweetness with a sharp note in the finish . the taste is rather bland and sugary , but there are more caramel or roasted notes than a typical macro-red . the body is way too light , but i guess that is what makes this beer easy to drink .'

S"presentation : 22oz bottle in a shaker pint baside : fyi - the 22oz halloween ales are actually brewed by gritty 's at their freeport brewpub . the 12oz are contract brewed by shipyard . so be warned ... . poured slow , thick , silent & viscous . deep , almost lush nose , rich & sweet . brown sugar , dried stone fruits ( cherry ) , caramel/corn syrup , really high quality leather . it feels like you could fall into it , strong with atmosphere , like an old house . with a little bloom some faint butterscotch emerges , finally becoming overall lighter with a dried fruit quality . head was a thin blanket of very loose latte hued foam that faded almost immediately into a transparent sheen of a floater with an delicate edge ring . color is striking , a radiant , crystal clear cherry mahogany , warm & rich , like an antique sideboard that 's been cared for & passed down for generations . some isolated bubbles rise zombie-like , slowly , no hurry , thru the abyss . too bad there is no head on this beauty ... .perhaps that is how they got the idea for the `` headless bartender '' label ? ahhhh ... after a few sips create some room an aggressive , vertical re-pour creates a solid 2 finger 's of tight , sticky , lightly snapping foam that has some descent retention and laces like torn drapery in the windows of that abandoned house at the edge of the neighborhood that the kids wo n't go near . this is much , much prettier to look at ! a nice , creamy balance initially , it starts off lightly sweet , full & wet , but then shifts into a more bittersweet , semi-dry feel . the taste is eventually more bitter than sweet ( although some distant brown sugar & dried cherry add an echo of sweetness ) , but its a tough call as it walks that line very well . the caramelized malts are burnt & add to the bitter nature & dry mouth-feel . hops are round with a slightly citric ( orange ) quality to them . they add both that citrus sweetness initially and then bitterness as it warms . typically any balance is immediately noticeable , but this almost teeter-totter balance from tongue to palate is , to me , atypical yet rather enjoyable . there is not much transition from this bittersweet aspect/feel as it hits the palate , finishing sweeter with burnt caramel , a little drier , leaving more bitter than sweet with a woolen , slightly chewy , tannic aftertaste that films over my tongue and is slightly unpleasant , to be honest . a nice beer that has 2 gears . i liked the shift from initial taste to palate , but did n't particularly care for what transpired after that . it"

S"poured from a can into a cup , no freshness date found on can . a : light gold/yellow , clear and very bubbly . lots of head foams up and then dies down , but a little slower than many macro lagers . a little lacing sticks to the cup as well . s : not much to smell , a little bit of adjuncts and alcohol , typical for the style however and thus still gets a '3 ' . t : somewhat clean , some astringent flavors in the middle , mostly hints of corn , rice , and other malty adjuncts . i say hints because no flavors are clear , vibrant , or even present for very long . a little off-flavors , but none of the metallic or salty off-flavors that sometimes ruin macro lagers . m : light and somewhat smooth , less carbonated than i expected . the lack of carbonation makes this beer seem watery , but lends a greater drinkability . d : very drinkable , without the presence of any bad off-flavors and nothing really offensive , plus the lower carbonation , this beer goes down like water . good in this aspect for the style . overall : not a bad macro , certainly better than many other choices . however , ( in my opinion ) miller high life gives this pig a black eye in every way ; especially in taste ."

S"poured into a big ole ' red wine glass , terrible is a pretty impressive looking brew . it pours a hearty opaque dark brown that looks black unless viewed in front of a light source , with a half inch of creamy off-white foam that dissipates fairly quickly into a film . the aroma is sweet , pleasant and floral -- reminiscent , in fact , of a good red wine . my first sip is too cold ; the beer needs to warm up a bit . my initial impressions of the beer are : sweet , tart , fruity and bright . it 's tasty but it needs a few minutes . after letting it sit for a few minutes it opens up ( note to self : sticking this in the fridge was a bad call ) . the taste is tricky to pin down , sweet and sour and complex . this one is all malt , no hop presence at all . initially it 's sticky sweet , mildly reminiscent of molasses or toffee . a flower-like bouquet and bright yeastiness mix with a bit of woodiness ( the classy kind , like a rich old guy 's desk ) and a very subtle hint of tobacco spiciness . you definitely get a sense of the 10.5 % this brew is packing too , but it 's not in an unpleasant way . still , this one is a sipper . mouthfeel is pleasant but a bit unusual ; sticky , bold , and tart and acidic enough to make you pucker a bit , followed by a subtle alcoholic burn in case you forgot this beer is n't no sissy . it feels like it 's staining your teeth and it probably is , but that 's the price you pay when you drink a dark strong ale like this one . all in all this is a very , very good beer . i 'm not a big fan of this style and probably would n't get it again , but i 'm glad i tried it and would n't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who appreciates the style ."

S"hazy dark yellow from the reflected light from suspended yeast and wheat protein . the head is typically formidable . it 's thick , creamy and worthy to be sipped on before getting to the liquid . i 'll take a hefeweizen foam moustache over a milk one anyday ! the musty yeast notes and aromatic esters include the typical clove and bubblegum notes , but banana is surprisingly mild in aroma . not quite as pungent as other german hefeweziens , but quite appetizing in aroma nontheless . not quite as full bodied as other examples of the style -- it 's just a touch thin . there are more banana esters in flavor than expected from the aroma , but this hefeweizen is surprisingly subdued as far as yeast contributions as concerned . this is not a flaw , however , and only adds to the drinkability . finishes a bit tart w/ a touch of residual sweetness . although not as rich and complex as other german wheats , the drinkability is superlative . a bit more body would 've made this an excellent brew ."

S"thanks to my dad for bringing this out from the west coast for me . pours rich brown and transluscent with a medium off-white head , receding into a thin cover . plenty of lace . smell is typical barley wine , with some woody notes . low on sweetness for a barley wine . the wood gives mirror mirror a sour dryness that makes it a pretty confrontational beer . quite a solid hop presence . the mouth could use a bit more chewiness . with the dryness from the wood , some more malt backbone would give this more of a foundation , both in the taste and texture , although with it already being so high abv , do n't know how much more alcohol the yeast could take . definitely not the most drinkable beer out there , although it 's interesting and satisfying in some ways . not a good one to introduce someone to barleywines , but definitely worth a try once familiar with the style . an interesting and well made beer ."

S"the bottle calls this an `` empirical stout '' and has some clever copy on the bottle explaining the name and the designation . i 'd say that this is an imperial oatmeal stout . that 's the character i get from it . it appears black with brown highlights when held to the light and generates a decent head with a reasonably hard pour but the head does not linger and the lacing was minimal . imperial oatmeal is the most descriptive term i can give you for this . it reminds me of the best oatmeal stouts i 've had but bigger in flavor . the dark roasty flavors are huge and really linger on the palate . it tastes a bit charred and absolutely delicious . the mouthfeel is a bit thin for a beer of this stature . i like my imperials to be motor oil . i want a thick , heavy beer . yet , somehow this does n't bother me in this beer . i think the flavor is solid enough that i do n't mind the fact that it 's more medium-bodied . this beer has a stellar flavor , and the lighter mouthfeel proves to be an asset to this beer , it goes down much more smoothly than a heavy imperial . the dark , roasted character of this really shines and is quite satisfying . after my first sip i was in love , and i plan to pick up a couple more bombers of this to hang on to . definitely worth a try ."

S'dusky , faded orange . the amount of hops in this bad-boy cant help but make it moderately hazy . a few large , soapy bubbles punctuate a head that never gets over half-a-fingers worth of quickly dissolving foam . curious that head retention isnt greater given the quantity of hops as well . no . lacing . whatsoever . kinda disappointing appearance . oh what a bouquet ! a towering wall of all things hoppy ; blood oranges , pine-needle pulp mixed with cedar shavings and other citrus fruits . very floral and perfume-like , think grandmas rose-garden in spring , with some faint solvent alcohol carrying things along . a candy sweetness is in the back . an onslaught of hops unloads onto the palate , quickly numbing the tongue and bringing tastes of boiled orange-candy and strong , perfumey rose-water . an underlying wave of caramely-bready malt buttress this attack , but is squarely in submission to the hops . a vaporous , cloying rose-water character while interesting , is too forward and doesnt meld with the sharp , clean citrus flavors the other hops offer . last pours from the bottle produced a fair bit of sediment , bringing a bit more bread and fruity esters to the table . i love rogue brews and had high expectations , but this one left me cold .'

S"i 've now had three bottles of this wit , and my opinion has not changed ; this is a thoroughly mediocre beer . i picked it up recently instead of blue moon . with blue moon , i knew what i was getting - a fairly good wit . i took a chance with this affordable alternative . after being poured , the thin , fine , head disappears fairly quickly . the first thing you notice about this is that it really does n't look like a belgian white . it is almost completely clear . you expect a wit to be cloudy . the aroma is pleasant , and you can definitely detect the citrus . this beer smells better than it tastes . this beer makes your mouth tingle quite a bit when you drink it , even though it does n't appear highly carbonated . it does feel the way it looks - a bit too watery . the taste is unspectacular , and a bit bland . no flavors really jump out at you . it tastes like a wit , but far too weak . you get a hint of the spices , and a hint of the citrus , but it really leaves me wanting more . this is not a bitter beer either . it strikes me as less sweet than other wits . however , it is a refreshing , quenching , beer . this beer does go down easy . if i cared to , i could drink quite a few . unfortunately , i do n't care to ."

S"poured this into a sam adams perfect pint glass and set it on the counter . the eighth of an inch of foam that capped this beer literally disappeared in the amount of time it took me to turn aroound to the sink , rinse out the bottle , and turn back . if i had n't seen the head when i poured it , you could n't have convinced me that it had one to start with . the aroma is minimal , but decent . nothing jumps out at you . it smells fruity , almost peachy . you have to sniff deep and long to get anything from it . the flavor is mediocre . i do n't see how this can be called an ipa . it 's a pale ale at best . it reminds me of magic hat # 9 , and that 's not a good thing . i 'm really glad i only had one bottle of this . i definitely wo n't look for this beer again ."

S'pacifico is a perfect example of why mexican beer in brown bottles taste better than their clear bottled cousins ... this has the same basic ingredient base as corona or sol , yet it tastes much less skunky ... there are still the dms and corn tastes here , yet they are much more manageable ... this beer goes down much better on a sweltering hot day.. you can definately drink this without a lime ... cheers ! ! !'

S"12 oz . bottle poured into an ommegang chalice . a-clear orange liquid , 1/2 '' head quickly dissapates to a sticky froth that leaves excellent lacing . unseen carbonation . s-smells like pine and alcohol fumes . t-pine then fruit juice ( maybe apricot ) then grass/evergreen then finishes with alcohol and syrupy sweetness combined ... .you know , i was expecting a hop bomb , as anything that 's hopped continuously for 90 minutes should be really hoppy , right ? right ? hmmm ... . , or maybe it 's really hoppy with hops that do n't depart a bitter , citric twang ... this does have a bitterness , of course , but it 's of the kind that i can sleep through . it says on the label that it is balanced by a `` ridiculous amout of 2- row barley '' , i think the malts are undetectable except in the taste of sweetness . the hops balance this sweetness , i suppose , but they are really not giving the hop presence i expect out of an imperial ipa . instead of hop burps , i get alcohol burps , go figure ... medicinal aftertaste is n't that great either , imho . m-i have to say , the mouthfeel in this beer is superb , i would classify it as medium/full , and did n't expect it to be so thick . unseen , microscopic carbonation aids in this , i think . d-one is plenty for me . too alchoholic/syrup-sweet for me , or maybe there 's too many stone ruinations under the bridge ... i 'm pretty disappointed , but glad i tried it though . crux : interesting take on dipa . i think i have to resample this perfumy cordial when i become more beer-sophisticated ... i 've had friends tell me that it 's fantastic on-tap ..."

S"i picked this up at barley 's taproom and pizzaria in knoxville , tn . the pour was yellow with a one half inch head . the head quickly dissapated to a light ring that did n't stick to the sides of the glass . the smell was sweet with a strong grape if not a wine overtone . the taste was more like that of mead than beer . the start was that of wine with a just a hint of honey . the finish was a mix of sweet and sour grapes . absolutely no hops here ! it was n't a bad drink , just not what i expected . quite refreshing , makes a great dessert ."

S"in the context of beer , the rating for this would be questionable . in the context of dessert , this is amazingly good . crack open the bottle and butterscotch aromas are already leaping at your nose . it pours deep brown black with almost no head . delicious flavors of butterscotch , caramel , and burnt vanilla . lingering boozy warmth . sitting at the bar , i 'd say maybe , maybe not . after a meal , why not have a dessert with 10 % alcohol ?"

S"ten fidy review i could n't wait from the time i first tried this beer a few weeks ago to write a review about it . i was picking up some beer to-go tonight and figured it would be worth it to get a can and write up a few lines about it . first off , i love craft beer in a can ! ! ! ! there is something almost romantic about a can of beer and now that i can get good beer in a can , it makes that romance even hotter . i poured this bad boy into a 16 ounce pint glass . there was a little head straight outta the can , a milky chocolate color , which slowly dissipated . the aroma was full of dark roasted malts with dark chocolate . the taste was mellow ... no bite for a beer that boasts a 10.5 % abv . if you get the chance to try a can of this epic brew , do n't put it off ... this dog will hunt !"

S"330 ml bottle 5.8 % abv appearance : light golden colour - almost looks like a macro ... though the head does make up for this . large , creamy , white head that lasts pretty well and leaves reasonable lace . smell : well i guess in a honey beer , honey should be the first thing you smell ? it is and what a great smell it is , smells like fresh honey straight from the comb . wheat malt and a slight nuttiness are also present . taste : hmmmm the taste is n't quite what i was expecting , the honey is still there but it 's toned down from the smell . the wheat malt is slightly more pronounced and there is a hint of bitterness ( and i really do mean only a hint ) . mouthfeel : way too thin , in this aspect it feels like a macro , though the carbonation does a good job to correct that feeling . this beer is perfectly carbonated . drinkability : this beer does go down very easily , more like a 4.0 % not a 5.8 % ... birkenhead brew very distinctive beers . they all ( ranging from a stout to a pilsner to honey-wheat ale ) have a nuttiness in the aroma . i recommend that anyone visiting south africa take the time to find some of these beers ."

S"i 've had this before but it 's been awhile and i last tried it on a fatigued palate so i decided to pick up another bottle . poured into my la trappe glass . a strong pour helps form a small head that immediately fades away to essentially nothing . body is that familiar dirty yellow orange color i 'm noticing is a theme with beers in this style . aroma is brings on more funk with sour green apples and citrus peel than my usual cantillon classic gueuze along with a healthy dose of oak and an understated sweetness . very sour and acidic on the palate . significantly more vinegar bite and puckering sour fruit character than most others in the style i 've tried recently . aftertaste is rounded out by more oak and a dry white wine finish . crisp carbonation composed of very small fine bubbles . not as effervescent as some gueuze 's but still very nice . drinkability takes a small hit due to the comparative boldness of the flavor profile , even in relation to beers in the same style . 375ml bottle was just about the right amount . overall a very nice ale at a decent price with the smaller bottle . i 'll likely work this into my rotation in an effort to stop drinking so many expensive 750ml bottles of american wild ale when i need my sour fix ."

S'22oz . bottle into tulip pint . the appearance is a clear golden hued yellow body with a thick foamy white head that leaves beautiful lacing . the hop varieties used give forth predominately citric , floral and pine notes with a very light malt backing . the flavor is also of citric and floral hops , though there are some slight herbal hop notes as well . the malts i can detect seem to be lending mostly caramel notes with some biscuit notes as well . the hops and malts are very closely balanced , though the hops do come through in the finish to give a bitter , slightly dry finish . the mouthfeel is decent medium body with good carbonation . this is a very drinkable and pleasant beer , though i do wish there was a slight stronger emphasize on the hops , as i could easily mistake this for an american pale ale .'

S'poured out a very rich , lightly carbonated , saturated deep amber color . very nice color ! the head was quite full , more than three fingers and a creamy light tan color . as it died down slowly it formed into mountainous territory , and it left a good amount of lacing on the side of the glass in a ring with streamers coming down from it . the head was loath to remove itself , and was present for pretty-much the entire glass , finally as a ring at about half-way through the glass . the nose is powerfully hopped and strong . spicy and fresh-smelling , like a grape-fruit , more like an ipa if i might say so , and strong enough to smell it a foot and a half away initially . as i taste it thereis a powerful hop bitterness upfront -like a kick in the tongue- but that bitterness gives way to a much more mild malt flavor as the hops make less of an impact . this is quite opposite of most beers that i like , they usually start sweet and end bitter . a fresh taste , as of light uncooked vegetables ( cucumber ) refreshes the palate as well as balancing the bitterness of the beer itself on the aftertaste . hops are not only bitter , but there is a wonderful grapefruit flavor all throughout , giving it a funky citrus kind of twist . as you drink the glass , the balance comes more into the middle ground , but it still stays well on the side of hop bitter . the malt itself has a very pleasant sweetness that serves to accentuate the character of the hops , rather than battle with it . even though it is dark , i cant detect any roasted or burnt malts or chocolatey flavors here ; its not that kind of bitterness . towards the finish the alcohol taste makes its mark , but is not off at all , it seems to fit well in the overall taste . mouthfeel is just about right , without feeling heavy it just feels dense in flavor , almost condensed . this is a very well crafted brew , with no off-tastes to mar it and the balance is skewed in just the right way to make it stand out from the crowd . the bitterness hooks your interest , but the rest of the flavor keeps your attention on where it should be : the whole package . this beer has just changed the way that i look at hops .'

S"this is a slightly below average dark beer that i find to be a bit on the overrated side , it 's twice as popular as it should be . appearence : looks ok , slightly above average , nothing to report . smell : smells great as far as im concerned , just as any dark beer smells . taste : tastes slightly worse than an average dark beer would , with a bit of a solid bite after a drink , with a hint of some cheap hops . mouthfeel : very bubbly which makes for an unpleasent mouthfeel , but it 's bearable to say the least . drinkability : average drinkability , nothing special . goes down smooth but has a strong bite to it that almost all dark beers have . bottom line : plain and simple , not reccomended . i must say that this is a sort of a below average beer that the only thing that i could really note as a special feature was the smell . cheers"

S'the color out of the bottle is a glorious reddish-copper with a fizzy half-inch head . the aroma is bursting with hops , with notes of grapefruit and pine being most prominent . the flavor is likewise overflowing with hop bitterness , eliciting the feeling of eating a ripe grapefruit at a small table in the middle of a pine forest after a rainstorm . not content to just be a hop bomb , though , this one also has a substantial malt backbone , with big flavors of caramel and toffee . nicely carbonated and having a texture that is oily but also somewhat creamy , it should go down smooth , but it is just overwhelming . although the alcohol is certainly present and noticeable , especially as the beer warms , the booziness is not the biggest obstacle to drinkability . rather , it is the combination of big hop bitterness , dense malt sweetness , and the high alcohol that just overloads the palate . i thought i liked big flavors as much as the next guy , but the abundance of everything packed into the double bastard is just too much .'

S"now here 's a very interesting brew from rock art . in celebration of benjamin franklin 's 300th birthday on jan. 17th , 2006 , a couple of brewers with ancestrial links to franklin have decided to honor him with this fine brew . rock art is just one of the many ( i hope ) breweries that have decided to make this beer . more info about it can be found at www.poorrichardsale.com . anyway- getting to my review now pours a perfect amber color with a moderate head made up of medium to large bubbles . smells of corn , molasses , and grains . tastes mostly of a grainy cornbread combined with some nutty flavors . in the background lies molasses , and smoked hickory . this is a quite smooth beer that ends on a bit of a bitter note . this was a very enjoyable beer for me as i love beers that not only make an attempt at a style but at a specific time frame ."

S"pours a dark black color , with just a touch of amber on the edges when held to a light . not much head to speak of , more of a brown colored sudsy layer , that forms a small , bubbly ring . the aroma definitely has a coffee , vanilla and bourbon quality . however it 's much more than just that , there are deep caramel notes , brown sugar and espresso . just rich and creamy , i can tell there is some definite complexity to this beer . the flavor is intensely complex . you 're hit initially with a well developed espresso flavor combines with bouzy bourbon notes and a rich creamy quality . it finishes with a well developed a burn that does n't overpower the roasted , bitter coffee flavors that round this beer out . full bodied and creamy mouthfeel . bcbcs really is impressive . so complexly flavored and i love that the coffee character can stand out amongst all the bourbony goodness . it is quite rich so i certainly ca n't drink much of it , but really who cares ?"

S"11.2 oz bottle boured into a large wine glass . pours a deep opaque brown ... very nearly black . huge 1.5 '' head ... very rocky , very loud , very nice . the first thing i notice in the aroma is yeasty breadiness . a bit of clove and some banana is noticeable . big and rich aroma . i dig it . the taste is certainly more subdued than i was expecting . a bit of yeast , a bit of malt ... a touch of doughy breadiness ... . kinda boring though ... . not exactly bad ... just ... eh . the mouthfeel is a bit too crisp and thin for my taste . very drinkable for a 9 % brew ... . i just remember this one being more memorable ."

S"the liquid looks average but the head sets it apart . deep copper/caramel color with a large whispy off white head with decent retention . different nose on this . full of herbal spicey qualities . very green . coriander and asparagus rule , fennel , with some tropical fruit nuances . much is going on in the nose but not in a delightful manner for my liking . well the beer is solid . not nearly as green in the mouth although still herbacious . menthol , fennel , starfruit , pineapple , tangerine , pomeganate , coriander , caramel belgian yeast , and mango . complex but lacks body and depth . i 'm not crazy about much of the yeast and spices in certain belgian and belgian style brews and this is one of them which hurts drinkability for me ."

S"a - a light very clear , reddish amber coloured beer with little head that quickly fades . has little carbonation s - a nice little bitter scent of hops , but mostly it has the typical sweet smell of brutopia malts . perhaps the bar atmosphere and cold temperature reduce the scent . t - starts off sweet with that usual brutopia taste , common to all of their beers . it gives it a nice biscuity , bready flavour without any fruitiness despite the sweetness . it gives away to a nice bitterness with the flavours of american hops , pine needles , leaves , and cloves to close a whip quick , refreshing finish , despite low carbonation . m - a rather coarse , drying feel to it , with a refreshing bite coming from the hops . d - huge drinkability , i tend to go through half a dozen of these in a sitting . it 's straightfoward simple flavours make it easy to enjoy and wow , is it ever refreshing on a hot summer day . this beer changes often enough , this one was had on july 28 , 2007 at the start of a fresh batch ."

S'always pleased to find a local brew of value and excellence . found on many store shelves here in california , and from the tap at many central californian eateries , this is a handsome ale that pours a caramel brown with light carbonation and a similarly light head that will in all odds fade before you are half way into your glass . nevertheless , this brew aged in oak barrels grants the imbiber a soft mouthfeel , sweet and nutty flavour , with an ever so delicate hint of hops . if i were ever to call a beer well-balanced , this would be a prime candidate . tasty , relatively light whilst paradoxically rich and extremely drinkable , this firestone double barrel will oft be found in the fridge at my home , readily offered to beer drinkers of taste who seek refreshment above the average .'

S"bottle thanks to sean at our recent tasting ... light black pour with decent carbonation ... i 've heard most of these are infected , at first ours did n't seem to be . only a hint of funk comes through . as it warms it becomes more prominent . however , my poor rating of this beer i ca n't pretty surely say is not due to the infection but the mess of a blend this is ... aroma is a hint of funk , but this is mostly dominated by the winter warmer portion of this blend , its very hot and spicy way too much pepper and spice comes through ... the taste is more spicy pepper and not in a good way at all . light roast but not enough to cut the peppers . so many reasons not to get this ; high chance of infection and the fact that it was n't a good blend in the first place ."

S'kind of funny two animals , duck rabbit , and two drinks , barley ( beer ) wine . note this beer has been aged for one year . pours a darker amber to brown color with some reddish hues throughout . a good pour but left a very limited head . a few swirls helps a bit but limited . so goes per the lace . the nose has a good malty backing with some minor hops notes . the malt has some minor complexity but would have expected more . some caramel note but mostly a sweet grainy malt aroma . some alcohol notes but pretty clean yeast wise . not much hops in the nose either . the taste has more of that complexity that i look for in the malt . the caramel flavors come out more with some depth . imo , i would have liked more depth but a good start . the hops also come out nicely with some light earthy and hints of citrus notes . some esters as well , cherry , apples and pears . some minor fusels , which is not ok , but some minor alcohol as well . really a nice rounded out flavor . the body is moderate to big . so sure this is a year old , but it actually is pretty tasty . i would have liked a bit more complexity in the malt but overall good .'

S"appearance was light golden-amber with a small white cap that left a fair amount of lacing on the cup ( yes , sadly it was a cup -- they do n't serve glasses outside ) . not much detected in the nose aside from sweet fruit . taste followed suit , with a thick sweetness of apricots and hints of mango up front , followed up by a showing of biscuity grain in the middle , finishing semi-sweet and slightly dry . very smooth and very refreshing , this would be a superb beer for a hot summer day or to finish off a good meal , and probably a good introduction for someone unfamiliar with or turned off by more powerful brews ."

S"pours a two finger head , rather thin and lacking body . light straw colored with a good bit of bubble dancing to the surface . nothing a light lager does n't do but i suppose if you 're into this look it 's ok . does n't have that explosive nature of a belgium or even some macros . a sweet and almost sour nose . a good hop back ground that has that earthy euro sour hop nature to it . bubble gum finishes the beer . very dry finish even in the nose . hops oddly come out first in this one . that sour hoppy effect ( i 'm sure the yeast is a big factor here ) . the beer the finishes with bubble gum as if it uses a hefe yeast strain . i have to admit this is a style i 've never had before so i 'm a bit confused . it has a nature similar to some belgium with a german hefe finish . the beer amazingly finishes pretty dry . as it warms and gets flat it 's reminding me more and more of a dry hefe . i think that means it 's missing some of the key elements of a hefe , but at the same time this beer serves a purpose with more foods i think . very drinkable , i could have a tone of these if not for ... . the mouth feel on this beer is just bad . way too much carbination . i 'm burping all over the place , and the bubble nearly explode in my mouth . i like to feel the bubbles , not to have all my beer turn into head in my mouth so i can burp it back up . i 'm pretty sure this is common of the style as all their beers seem to be perfect execution of the styles , but this honestly is really off putting in an otherwise very worthy beer . worth noting that after the beer has had a chance to deflate it 's pretty nice in the mouth feel department . i 'm not sure how to score it though . it had that over carbonated effect for nearly half the beer . it 's calmed down a lot and is almost a creamy with a pretty good carbonation bite . as with all styles i 'm not a lover of . style considered but scored mostly on its own merits . always worth point out the price point on the beer in question . 16.9 oz at 2.99 . that works out to 12.73 for a 6 pack . or 11.89 if they were in 11.2oz bottles . not a bad price really . you factor in that expected marginal discount and you might very well in 11.2 oz bottles see this for 9.99 which imo would make it a great deal . marketing departments , i"

S"pours dark , dark brown that 's pretty close to black in the glass underneath an impressive frothy tan head that recedes quickly leaving a thick collar and lots of boozy legs on the sides . whoa , the aroma is big and crazy sweet . there 's a dominant rum-soaked dark fruit sweetness with some toffee and molasses . the other major aroma is the barrel which imparts a vanilla sweetness and bourbon on top of that . the taste is more of the same but with a bit more of the bourbon coming out , especially in the finish which leaves an alcohol burn after each sip . of course , the sugary malts , dark fruits , chocolate and tobacco underpin the barrel . big flavors . the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and seriously boozy on the palate with spicy oak as well . this is a definitely dessert beer , quite a sipper . the massive bourbon presence and sweetness definitely limit the drinkability but it 's what i 've come to expect with the big bruery beers ."

( l/m/ac ) the aroma was similar to lemon zest and orange . although the orange smell may have been from the orange slice it came with which i tossed . the taste lacked luster . the waitress described it as being like a blue moon . i have n't had a blue moon in a long while but based on memory i would reluctantly have to say blue moon tasted better than this . it seemed like there was not enough time or effort put into this one . this maybe good to drink if you 're sitting outside on the patio in the heat . it was like a cross between a sparkling orange/ lemonade with a hint of witbier . it had `` chug '' ability . conclusion , worth having on a very hot day , otherwise i would skip it ."

S"i 'm not really sure how to review this beer - it 's my first of the style , and i think it 's safe to say it may be the last . i 'll try to put that aside though and review it based on the guidelines of the style ... to that end , it seems to fit the style to a tee . super pale straw colored pour with a bubbly , carbonated-looking white head that recedes almost immediately and completely . no film , no crown , nothing . nose is sour . a bit of a white wine kind of scent - light fruits , i assume ? then comes the taste ... wow , total sour bomb . i genuinely made that sour pucking expression made cliche from old warhead wrappers . this was just too much for me . through the sourness , i think i discerned light fruits - definitely peach , as the name suggests . body is quite thin with fairly heavy carbonation . if you can stand the sour , this is quite drinkable - if not , then you may end up with a drain pour . i 'm trying my best to avoid doing that , but this beer is just too much for me ... i kind of wish they had indicated on the label just exactly what this beer is all about . my first sip came as quite the shock ."

S"ordered a pitcher at a pre-fab resturaunt chain ( montana 's ) . as always for beers off the tap , it was the perfect temperature , just short of ice cold . it 's a solid gold with a sprightly white head . no hints , no tones toward the edges . pure gold . impressive . smelled decent , nothing to write home about . the taste was sweet from corn , but i felt it was a nice touch . they did n't overdo it . as a light beer fan , i enjoy a lager that 's low on the bitter and high on smoothness . it 's one of the most drinkable non-lights i can think of . my only complaint is with the carbonation , which hurts a lot more than it helps . the flavour would come through just fine if it were allowed to sit and lose it 's fizzyness , provided the temperature was maintained ."

S"light amber in color and almost lager - like in clarity . the head settles into a tight layer that leaves a sparse lace . mild diacetyl , slight biscuit malt and a bit of cidery sweetness in aroma . very lightly bodied , and highly carbonated for style ... it lacks the smoothness that a good esb should have . the flavor is comprises of light caramel malt notes , a bit of toasted malt flavors , but there 's really not much else there . caramel malt and redsidual sweetness is sufficiently balanced by the hop bitterness . the finish is dry , clean , and unremarkable . there 's a definite lack of a malt foundation in this brew , but its cleanliness and balance give it good drinkability . if considered an esb , john courage is lacking all around , but is good , no frills session brew ."

S"first had this as a single from blue dog tavern in lansdale , pa . i had to buy a case as soon as possible after trying this one . the pumpkin ales go fast around here . i did n't want to have to wait until next year . pour/appearance - medium body pour with fairly heavy carbonation . carbonation is tough to see though due to cloudiness . color is a warm amber . head disappeared quickly . smell - slight hint of alcohol through the hearty spiced pumpkin smell . taste - yumm . ever had a seasonal gingersnap cookie ? mix in some pumpkin there you have it . nutmeg , ginger and , of course , pumpkin overtones . feel - hits the palate evenly and the spices linger on the sides . feels like a light beer , but the warmth makes it seem heavier . very smooth . drinkability - due to the spicyness , not to be drank all day/night . it is a seasonal to enjoy when the time is right . much warmer and heartier than the other pumpkin ales i have had - which tend to be more watery . this makes it an ideal start to the fall season ."

S"quite an unusual belgian , especially for a `` quadrupel '' . pours a bright , darkish gold with a controlled , flat-topped off-white head . quite aromatic , with some of the standard quadrupel aroms : caramel , some spices , and some unusually hoppy citrus notes . the taste is where this veers off from quadrupel territory into something else -- something original , actually . normal , sweet malt and candi-sugar flavors are offset by peppery alcohol and hops . not as hoppy as , say , de ranke bitter , but much more hoppy than your average quadrupel . the alcohol is another thing . at first , it 's nice in a jolting peppery way , but the aftertaste suffers from an undue alcoholic burn on the back of the tongue and in the back of the throat ; the burn is reminiscent of drinking liquor . that , in my book , knocks down the scores for flavor and mouthfeel . the high alcohol content and burn also negatively affect drinkability . overall , this is an interesting taste experience , and i could imagine this being really great with certain foods , but taken on its own it has limited appeal for me ."

S"pours a brilliant copper-amber in color , topped with a frothy pale tan head and plenty of lace . nose offers up equal parts biscuit-y malt and yeasty tang , along with the barest hint of bitter hop . smooth and creamy on the first sip , with a lightly-sweet character and just a hint of alcohol -- not a very big beer for the style , mind you ( at least in the contemporary american interpretation ) , but the alcohol is there all the same . biscuit malt notes -and dry , cracker-like ones at that- work their magic here and add up to a very easy drinking , almost ( too-easy ) session-able beer . reminds me of the classic american mis-understanding of the esb style . . . a little different than what i 'd expect of a winter warmer in other words . unfortunately , this is only an average beer for its style , but with an excellent , smooth and creamy mouthfeel and drinkability that `` goes all the way to `` 11 '' , it is definitely a cut above average for an everyday sipper ."

S"had this on tap at mad mex a while back . review from notes . served in a snifter with one meaty finger of cream colored head . there were tenacious dark mocha hues of bubbles that ate away at the creamy foam after each sip - i love seeing some good cascading . there was a good solid wall of lace left behind . overall a beautiful beer . the smell was sweet , very very very very sweet . it was like inhaling straight hershey syrup . tones of dark fudge follow , but that was all . i give this a `` 4 '' because it is easily the most chocolaty smelling beer i have ever had , but i do n't rate higher because the aroma is so damn one-dimensional . the flavor starts with bitter cocoa nibs , then leads into milk chocolate . as it warms the beer grows ever more sweet . the alcohol is not very well hidden , however it does lend itself to this supreme sipper . the beer has a smooth , dry finish . definitely a desert beer . i liked this for what it was , certainly something worth sharing once in a while . but i struggled with my snifter , and a bomber would be impossible to drink unless i wanted to die from a sugar coma . i 'll choose oat or java over this or mokah any day ."

S'appearance : pours with an amber body and a white head which breaks up into a million small groups on the surface of the brew . smell : butterscotch and ripe fresh oranges . taste : sweet malt is followed by a complex hoppy medium bitterness that is really enjoyable . some citrus peel and breakfast tea . mouthfeel : a velvety rush of carbonation is followed up by a stingy strong fizz . this could be a limitation on the drinkability . drinkability : some of the harsh edges ( over-carbonation and unpleasant aftertaste ) in this brew knock the drinkability down a notch .'

S"drank a pint or two of this at the brewery . pours a black color with some barely perceptible brown edges in the sun light . the head grows to about 1 inch in size , but turns into a thick creamy layer , that lasts through the whole beer , leaving sheets of bubbles on the glass as it recedes . a fair amount of roasted quality on the nose , with some definite chocolate notes and a bit-o-marshmallow , which combined , forms a nice coffee-like aroma . there are also some very mild whiskey notes and a touch of spiciness . i felt the barrel qualities of the beer were more evident in the flavor , with a definite whiskey quality , the earthy , slightly spicy booziness that warms the the belly , punctuated by a bit of vanilla . all this being encompassed by an overall , chocolatey , slightly roasted malt character , finishing smoothly , with a bitter coffee flavor . the texture of this beer was great , so smooth and velvety . i hope it retains that perfect body out of the bottles . i enjoyed the heck out of this beer , so much so , that i had two pints of this and decided not to try the blueberry lambic that was available , as i had a sample of it at the great taste and was n't very impressed ."

S"the jokes to be made about this beer are too easy : did you know they sell it for only $ 4.20 a six pack ? ah , america 's most famous pot-producing county puts out a hemp ale . is this brewery run by teenagers ? as for the beer itself , it is a deep amber with aromas of alcohol and and caramel . this seems to be a brown ale flavored with hemp , though the base style is n't indicated anywhere on the bottle . the hemp tries to impart a drying finish to the beer as well as a nice oaky flavor . overall , it 's feel is smooth and creamy , though it does n't really go anywhere from start to finish . malts reign king at both the beginning and end , almost overpowering the hemp presence . by the end of a full pint , the feel is a little tiresome and comes across as heavily viscous . i 'm a big fan of spiced beers and have always defended chile , spruce , and other herb beers in the face of aspersions ( `` they 're made for tourists ; '' `` they 're a gimmick '' ) . humboldt 's hemp ale has n't convinced me that those criticisms should be ignored for hemp beers ."

S"750ml bottle , '07 vintage bottled in '09 shared with some friends and poured into a matching cantillon long stemmed tulip . the brew appears amber in color with an off-white to tan cap that maintains pretty solid retention for the style from a constant stream of carbonation rising to the surface . a light swirl revives the tan cap once it fades . the smell of this brew is bold with damp woody character upfront . more smells reveal a bit of herbal hop character that blends into a fruity aspect . a tangy lactic component is throughout with a very pronounced earthy , damp mildew-like character somewhat similar to moist cork . it smells quite enjoyable but individually the scents of this brew are a bit contrasting and unexpected when mixed together . the taste is tangy initially with an equally bold flavor of damp old wood and must just like the aroma indicates . it is both herbal with hoppy bitterness and earthy with a bit of dark fruited aspect . it is quite tangy and drying on the palate yet brings forth some salivation factor . as the brew warms up , there is a toasty flavor that seems to be like a toffee sort of grain indication or perhaps more reasonably a toasty depth of character imparted by the barrel aging . if possible , i would give this a 4.25 for taste , so i 'll round up to a 4.5 . this is a medium bodied brew with a lively level of modest to high carbonation . there is not much abv impact but the combination of sourness and herbal bitterness is very trying on the palate . i enjoyed this but the combination of bitterness and sourness overall degraded this brews drinkability for me . even though this brew was split equally between 4 people , i had a hard time finishing my ~5-6 oz . to this brews credit it was very unique with bold enjoyable barrel character . i would n't mind having a fresh one of these for comparison ."

S"i had one of these at clark 's ale house on a recent trip to syracuse . a - is highly viscous , dark brown and impervious to all light ; short beige head with mild lacing s - there is the slightest hint of an underlying hops scent that is almost completely overwhelmed by a maple-sweet , creamy essence t - it opens with a rush of malty sweetness that is nearly too much to handle ; but somehow this quickly becomes more than palatible , perhaps due to the balance effect of the ultra-high abv m - at once syrup-like , yet pleasant ; not much carbonization d - it 's weirdly enchanting in short doses , but if there is such a thing as the `` opposite of a session beer '' then this might be a good candidate"

S"best beer for the money . for $ 4.50 a 12 pack it ca n't be beat . a - looks like budweiser . head disapears quickly , but when you 're poor who cares about the head . the gold/brown can is pretty cheap though . s - not any worse than budweiser , unless bud is in a bottle . t - not the best , aluminum barley . after a few it starts to gain on you . m - no complaints for a cheap beer . d - very good drinkability , especially after 5 or so . hangoverability - very good . mcdonalds never tasted so good ."

S'pours a clear golden color with a white head that leaves minor lacing on the glass . nose is grassy and typical of the saaz hops . tastes soft and smooth . very crisp malt flavor in the beginning with the mild bite of the saaz hops towards the end . well done and balanced , but not complex in any way . mouthfeel is as would be expected , light bodied and pleasant . highly drinkable brew , and one to be respected . it is the original pils , though i have heard that they changed the recipe a little ?'

S"$ 8.99 from merchants for a corked and caged 750ml bottle.9 % abv per the bottle . fermented with sacch and brett . pours out to a cloudy dark golden , forming a finely carbonated creamy white head with excellent retention and a solid drape of belgian lace . the aroma is outstanding ... lots of horse blanket , barnyard , stinky and sweet wild flowers ( like an old ladies perfume ) , funky shoes , and basement must . the mouthfeel is powdery and fine with a deceiving medium body . the taste starts fruity and spicy with the above mentioned aromas , then in the middle i get cut grass and metals , then there is a awkward bittering green flavor in the finish . the bitterness in the ends strikes me as odd , chemical in nature , and does n't sit well . overall , there is plenty of malt body , but it 's not wonderfully sour like a flanders red . a mixed bag . open up nice , finishes poorly . quality , but probably not something i would seek out again ."

S"an almost straw-colored brew with plenty of carbonation with a nice loud hiss from the bottle and lively foam in the glass . the voluminous amount of foam forms a delicate head on top of the bee that leaves lace as it falls . stone soup is reminding me of a duvel , ( at least in appearance ) . the aroma is fruity and spicy with notes of lemon meringue . the mouthfee is soft like whipped butter ; this is a very delicate beer . the malt has a pilsner quality and blends in a very subtle way with a very light spiciness . i detect a mineral-like quality to this beer , but maybe it 's the just the name suggesting this to me . the dryness and slight tart character is very pleasant and makes this beer very sessionable . i 'm thinking of it as duvel lite ."

S"a - a two finger khaki head tops this strawberry-bronze and slightly hazy brew . the head settles at a tight cap and leaves a lot of tan lace on the glass on it 's way down . a swirl brings back a nice thick finger . s - a really hoppy pine and grapefruit citrus aroma greets the nose right of the bat , and sweet rhubarb and orange juice comes later . nice thick biscuity malts support the fruity and fresh hop notes . really nice ! t - wow . this is just about the definition of balance between citrusy and zesty pine resin hops and sweet fruity and biscuity malt . this is a really sweet beer , but the hop bitterness keeps that in check . this one is really juicy , fresh , balanced , and well made . m - medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a fresh , juicy , thirst quenching aspect . the finish is dry and full of north western pine needle hop goodness . d - one of the best session beers ever imo . it 's simple , but elegant , hoppy , and well made . it 's not going to blow your mind with complexity or off the wall insane flavors , but that 's not really what apas are about anyway . this is one of the top `` grab a sixer to take to my buddy 's backyard bbq '' beers !"

S'after sitting on this since it was released to day was the day to open and try this . first the triple dipped wax was a bit much , but i am sure it serves it purpose . as i poured this into my glass i was struck by how it really seems to be the constancy of motor oil . my glass is filled with a darker than night opaqueness with a ruby tinged slathering of a head . the aroma is pure oak infused malt . i can detect that this has some strength on it as well , as the alcohol rears it head . it really reminds me of world wide stout in aroma . i also think i get a bit of an oaty nose as well , which surprises me as i would think that this flavor is too delicate to shine through -- but it shows . i can not believe how much like a marsh mellow this beer feels like in each sip . this officially takes the place in the thickest beer i have ever tasted . each sip coats my mouth with a thick coat of strong notes of alcohol infused liquid dough . i see this as more of cookie dough than bread dough , but this is not a cookie you send your kid to school with . it is more of a liquor infused cookie . i actually have just noticed that it has many similar characteristics to marzipan , without the cloying sweetness . the hop flavor seems totally void , like the flavor was sucked up by the black hole this beer is . of course , it could stuck with that six ounces of sludge that i could not even think to stomach . yes this is a good beer , but for having to do away with over a 5th of it seems completely ridiculous . and for my taste i will stick to wws and dragonslayer for readily available imppy stouts around me .'

S'perforated date code of a021604 . my label looks different than the one posted , but the same style , but the house is by a river . aroma : roasted malt and chocolate malt blend in a nice bitter sweet chocolate aroma . appearance : opaque obsidian with the slightest deep brown head . head never really built up and collared quickly . carbonation lasted a while , but the head dropped off without lacing . flavor : starts rich and heavy and then disappears in the lightest hop mist . this stout has a wonderful balance with the light touch of dark malts and the restrained but firm hop bitter . i get a little cold coffee aftertaste and a little nuttiness after reading other reviewers notes . mouthfeel : while i see some carbonation , the beer feels rather flat , but smooth and creamy , so the low carbonation doesnt really detract from the experience . the swallow ends with a very clean finish . overall impression : a wonderful beer . it is refreshing and satisfying at the same time ; dark in color , light in taste , classic stout . carbonation is a touch low , but i think it actually helps drinkability , id down two or three of these on a hot alaskan day ( did i just say that ? ) recommended .'

S"pours a peachy fruit-juice color , slightly hazed , with a bountiful head sporting valleys and peaks like rounded-off meringue . it levels to a third-inch creamlike skim after several minutes . gobs and gobs of lace . like all jolly pumpkin stuff i 've had so far , this has the aroma of saddle blanket , well-worn tennis shoe , and/or band-aid ( or curad , does n't matter ) . in the lexicon of lovers of funked-up yeast , that means `` awesome '' . fruits try and work their way in , but the ancient musty-cellar atmosphere pretty much rules . i 'd like to give it a 4.5 or even a 5 , but since most of their beers smell like this , i can only give a 4 ... lack of differentiation being my only hangup . still a wonderful thing to sniff and savor . peach and pear manage to mingle with the yeast funk , though i 'm still getting band-aid . hops are light and springy , certainly present but not center-stage . malts are sweet and pastry-like , also not center-stage . this is more about the yeast than anything else . light white pepper and some other sharper spices , again not overbearing , just part of the mix , as are grapefruit pulp and other succulent citrus character . a nutty yeastiness emerges in the finish . mouthfeel is cool and buttery and glides right over the tongue with a zingy carbonation . ya like yer brett ? find it here ... or in just about any other jolly pumpkin ale , for that matter . because this is a beer focusing on the untamed quality of the yeast strain , it 's not gon na be for everybody . and even those who love this sort of thing might save it only for special occasions , or `` the mood '' . so maybe the drinkability is n't great , but it is a highly recommended beer to fans of the style , fantome and flemish primitive enthusiasts , and anyone into the more daring , unusual franco-belgian brewers ."

S'a very smooth pale ale , not too sweet , well worth trying and buying . i bought a six pack of this last week and after drinking macro light beers all winter , this beer was a real winner . it pours with very little head and a rich color . the smell is like any other pale ale .'

S'pours a clear , dark , golden color with a very large white head that takes a bit to dissipate . very nice lacing . smells of hops and pine ; fresh and inviting . tastes like it smells with hops up front and clean finish . hardly any aftertaste at all and no bitterness . medium to light-bodied , it has a pleasant mouthfeel . overall this is a very clean and crisp beer that gives you just a hint of hops without bitterness and makes a great session brew .'

S"my first encounter with this beer was on-tap and a real downer , but now i rather like it . it was at a pizza joint in wi , and i just thought it seemed like fizzy yellow beer . maybe it was bad taps , or the order got mixed up , or it did n't go well with the food ( least likely , in this case ) , or maybe i just have a renewed appreciation for clean beers . a= transparent gold , no lasting head s= grainy malt . taste , see aroma . hopped to balance sweetness but no aroma/flavor hops m = subtle body , but not watery . d = ideal do n't let the label fool you into thinking of this beer as a farmhouse ale , as in the belgian sense . it is perhaps most closely related to a cream ale , as ba suggests , and i 'll suggest that it could be the best one out there ."

S"this can is direct from china , sent to me aug '10 ... never tried this one while there myself ... a- typical chinese lager color ... clear , and pale yellow/dry grass . there is a very thin fizzy head that disappears about as quickly as it formed , leaving literally nothing behind . lots of lumbering carbonation rises to the top . non existent lacing on the side of the glass ... .just some spotty film . the only thing saving this score from a solid one is the old school pop top s- very little aroma ... i can smell some of the `` high quality rice '' that is stated as an ingredient on the side of the can , which keeps this very clean smelling . my wife summed this up best by saying that this smells just like her bud select 55 ! t- more of the same here ... .just mainly clean tasting rice , very mild sweet malt and perhaps some corn ... nothing else really but i will say that it is n't offensive . no hop bitterness whatsoever on the finish . wife also mentioned that she liked her bud select 55 better , hehe ! m- thin bodied and lots of scrubbing carbonation to keep this a very clean , very crisp feeling brew . does n't really remind me of anything except adjunct laden white rice . o- it is what it is ... china still has a ways to go when it comes to their beer industry ... .everything tastes virtually the same but i will say this , again ... i would drink this all day , as it 's so easy going . perfect hot weather beer or during a spicy meal , this would do the trick !"

S"the full sail session lager pours a bright golden hue with a vibrant white head . the carbonation is quite evident . the aroma is faint , with a hint of malt . the taste is quite good for the style . it is sweet with a subtle hoppy finish . there are no overpowering flavors . this beer is not heavy at all . the drinkability is very good . there is nothing to keep me from popping bottle after bottle of this beer except my self control . it 's not because it 's delicious . it 's because it 's just a nice beer . if ever there was a beer where the name says it all this would be it . it 's not meant to be a hop bomb . it 's not meant to rival westvleteren for the world championship o ' beers . it 's supposed to be a fall back beer , a beer that you can drink plenty of , and often . i think it succeeds at this admirably ."

S"live review . poured from the 1 pint , 6 fl . oz bottle that i bought at siciliano 's in grand rapids , mi for $ 11.49 during a recent trip there . i remember loving standard yeti and so i was excited to find this one . label mentions : bottled on : mar 06 2009 . 9.5 % abv . poured into my gold rimmed brewery ommegang labeled westvleteren style goblet . the label features a sillouhette of a yeti ( like the others ) holding a coffee cup . that is pretty cool . i also like the `` great minds drink alike '' cap under the gold foil cover . a the look of the entire `` yeti '' line has been great . this version 's look returns to the greatness that i recall from the standard yeti in that there is actually a dark brown , super creamy head over an oil black body . the lacing that is left on the inside of the glass is significant as well . it can not be improved in my opinion . 5.0 s i do smell espresso but also i perceive chocolate . it actually smells like a mocha java with some dark roast malt . i do not smell alcohol ( like i did in other versions of yeti ) and that is welcome . this beer actually has a smell that is very close to some of my favorite chocolate based stouts such as southern tier choklat . overall the smell is sweet , inviting and deep and interesting . 4.5 t really great deep dark roast coffee and malt taste with the taste of chunks of chocolate . i do n't taste any alcohol but the warmth that bubbles up from underneath tells me that it is indeed there . dark roast malt is what lingers into the aftertaste but the alcohol taste is again not there . just great ! 5.0 m big , huge creamy head contributes to a soft , creamy feel but there is a kick of hops and possibly the dark roast malt ( kind of like dark chocolate has an edge to it ) that keeps this from having the feel of a chocolate milk shake . i really like the feel of this beer since it is really fitting to what was promised by the label ... a big , fat coffee , oak , imperial stout . 4.5 d only fair . this is a huge beer that should be savored and sipped and could easily have been shared with another person . 3.0 notes : the espresso , unlike the slightly thin and disappointing chocolate oak aged yeti , delivers on all of its promises and presents as a huge , satisfying beer ."

S"appearance : pours a cloudy apple juice color with a modest head that drops quickly and leaves little lacing smell : sour horse blanket , barnyard uric acid smells waft upwards ; not something you want to spend much time smelling taste : starts out moderately sour and leaves you wondering which direction it is going to take as some pithy grapefruit flavors kick in ; in a few seconds , there is no doubt where you are headed as the sour flavors burst forth in your mouth ; very intense and assaults your tastebuds mouthfeel : medium bodied and modestly carbonated drinkability : i know some folks enjoy sour lambics , but i find them very challenging to consume as they bring to mind certain associative flavors that i do n't care to discuss in print"

S"12 oz . bottle into a pilsner . hazy light orange amber with half an inch of white head . leaves nice rings of lace . great aroma . honey sweetness from the malt and a nice mix of fruity , light hop aromas : citrus , peaches , and apricots . medium body with a medium carbonation and a slick , oily feel . complex hop flavors with notes of citrus rinds . finishes with a honey-apricot sweetness balancing out the oily hop bitterness . a touch of alcohol in the finish as well . i think the blonde ipa idea sounds and smells a little better than it tastes ; the combination is slightly jarring and not hugely drinkable . but it 's certainly a complex , interesting brew ."

S"2006 edition . well this is a new one ... my first beer from alaskan brewing and i suspect my first beer from alaska , period . pours from a 22oz bomber into my goblet , and fills it with a lush looking deep brown ( nearly black ) beer . there 's a toasted red-tan head that settles in around the outside edge and lies low , but sticks around a good while . this smells great , if you like wood-smoke . very reminiscent of a rauchbier , the first thing to hit your nose is a smoky , meaty wallop that reminds me of a peaty scotch -- lagavulin , anyone ? hiding behind the smoke are the usual porter suspects of coffee and roasted grain , but they hide well . alaskan smoked porter certainly lives up to its name . the flavor is equally bold . for a poor approximation of this , take some liquid smoke and squirt some into a good porter -- say anchor -- and stir . the flavor is n't unpleasant , but it 's assertive and rich . i suddenly question the wisdom of drinking this on one of our miserable 90 degree carolina nights . oh well , too late now . but i 'm getting sidetracked . i 'm tasting a lot of smoke character , which wraps up the sweet roasted malts , coffee , cocoa , molasses and burnt sugars in a thick smoked blanket . the flavors complement each other nicely , but i ca n't help but think there 's a little too much smoke going on here . the mouthfeel is near perfect though , fizzy without being harsh and smooth going down . the aftertaste is again more smoke and burnt grains and lingers long . interesting . this is an oddball beer . it 's good , but much like a smoky , salty scotch , it 's not something i 'd drink on a regular basis . kudos to those crazy alaskans for doing something different and doing it well . give me a bottle of this on a frigid northern night while i 'm sitting on beech logs around a roaring fire and my score would likely be much higher . it 's all about context . more kudos to edgelow for the bottle ."

S"appearance : a nearly clear orange-amber body with lots of sediment in solution . on top , a generous ivory-colored head that endures until the end of the glass , leaving excellent lacing ( especially given the high alcohol content ) . aroma : there 's certainly no mistaking this for anything but a double ipa . up front , a massive wave of potent northwestern hops with the classic floral , piney , and citrusy characteristics . underneath , a solid caramel malt base and plenty of booze . taste : wow , this is big . once again , the hops lead the charge and exhibit brilliant piney , resiny , and citrusy ( mostly grapefruit ) flavors . it 's not a total hop-bomb blowout though , as the biscuity caramel malt backbone and brawny alcohol content are able to keep everything relatively balanced . while it 's certainly a bitter beer , and i do n't doubt the over 100 ibu rating for a second , the bitterness can be deceptively mellow at times . the aftertaste is strong and dominated by bitter , grapefruity hop flavors . mouthfeel : medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a dry finish . you can certainly feel the booze in the mouth and throat , but they are pleasant sensations . the resiny hops tend to coat the mouth , giving the bitter aftertaste lots of life . drinkability : with a massive flavor profile , over ten percent alcohol content , and a full body , this is certainly a `` sip-and-contemplate '' beer . that being said , i had no trouble whatsoever devouring all 22 ounces in one sitting . verdict : as i had expected , with over 100 ibus and 10 % alcohol content , maharaja is a massive beer . this is your typical big , untamed , unleashed double ipa with a massive hop character , but a solid enough malt backbone to keep everything in check . this is only the second avery beer i 've tried , but i have to say i 'm thoroughly impressed so far ."

S"bottled on 11-17-09 shared by andy and poured into a tulip . this one pours an oily black color with about a finger of bubbly dark tan head that settles down almost right away . rubbing alcohol and rubber are the first things that come to mind on this . seeems to be a little bit of rich chocolate in the background of the aroma but in the end this one smells like a magic marker . this is a sweet syrupy beer ; a little bit of cherries and chocolate in the aroma but this is simply a sweet alcohol bomb . the body is full and sticky . it 's hot and simply unpleasent . in the end this one simply does nothing for me . i do n't know see any appeal here . brewers , please stop brewing gimmicks and make decent beer ."

S'a light tan head is released from the bottle into the glass . thick , dark brown . great head retention that leaves a little lacing . lots of bitter toffee and bakers chocolate . plenty of bitter chocolate and coffee define the bitter malts and hops . smooth palate halps make this a great sessionable beer .'

S"another brew provided by my great buddy inflatablechair ... . shared a while back at ditmier 's abode . pours with a nice frothy brown head ... the brew is clear when held to a light despite being black in the glass . clean roasty aroma ... very traditional.. hints of cocoa with warmth . again very clean on the palate ... . roasty but still plenty of rich toasty maltiness.. pretty standard and well made black lager ... i liked it and would certainly pick it up fairly regularly if it was available to me . cool score sammy ... appreciated . 4/3.5/3.5/3.5/4.5"

S'22oz bottle poured into pint glass pours a brownish orange , slightly cloudy , fine visible carbonation going steadily still several minutes after pour . head pours nearly white , big and puffy , leaving thick sheets on the sides of my glass . smell is good but not very strong ( probably too cold ) . smells malty , maybe slightly smokey . taste is good , malty with a good woody bitterness . a little sour , very nutty . mouthfeel is thick but gritty . probably would have been smoother if i had left a half inch or so in the bottom of the bottle . very drinkable .'

S"real solid one to two finger head , languidly takes its time resolving , leaving lots of sticky lacing in its wake . cloudy chestnut brown in color with a tint of red or burnt orange at certain angles , fully opaque . viscous texture in the nose , warm honey and molasses , scones , dates and golden raisins , rum cake , spice jars which have sat in grandma 's cabinets since the 70 's , outside of a touch of grapefruit zest the hop presence is indistinct , if not absent for it . full-bodied , clings to the palate like a life raft , yet , somehow avoids heaviness . much more milk chocolate and carob here , plays well with the sugariness in the cherry , plum , raisin , date flavors . licorice and baked cinnamon spice play a role as well . the carbonation content in its support , breaks up the clinch like a boxing ref . just as in the nose , the hops exert their presence through the finish but do not necessarily coalesce into distinct qualities . this allows for a cleaner finish while concurrently not staunching the sweet fruitiness , which remains its primary attribute ."

S"bottle marked sept. of 2010 . pours near black . looks just like a stout should . smells of chocolate , malts , and hops . has a slight coffee hint also . taste is far to light for a stout . very creamy and little carbonation . chocolate and coffee are predominate . no alcohol taste at all , guess thats why its only 4.69 % . mouthfeel is amazing , very smooth ( like keith stone ) , creamy , just enough carbonation . because the flavor and abv is so light i do n't see how a person could not drink three in a few hours . this is a great beer to just chill with , fishing , camping , whatever . not huge in flavor but it makes up with mouthfeel and the drink ."

S"poured from a 22 oz bottle into an imperial pint glass . thick chocolate color with impressive creamy tan head and complex lacing . nose is dominated by chocolate malt and coffee aromas . mouthfeel is creamy and thick but not syrupy . taste is malty , chocolaty , and nutty with underlying subtle sweetness and a wiff of alcohol arises late . hop bitterness is short lived and finish is clean and surprisingly dry . clearly an impressive oatmeal stout . i love one every now and then - usually with a hearty meat and potatoes meal , but i ca n't see drinking it daily or as a session beer ."

S"poured from a 2/1/2008 vintage 375ml bottle purchased at bierkraft in brooklyn , ny into a lindemans peche flute . a : lots of foam and crazy rolling carbonation from the pour that dissipates into a 2-finger , then 1-finger , then a few little bubbles of a head . is a glowing tangelo color with `` swirls '' of red and orange as you agitate the beer . s : it 's a peach of an evening . even though this lambic is brewed with raspberries it still smells like a peach tart . t : surprisingly oaky at the front turns into a cherry flavored sour punch straw . finishes with a lemony zest that sits on the back of the tongue . m : pretty thin and not too lively . a little carbonation tinge hits the palate but stays true to the lambic style . d : the best feature of this beer in my opinion . at 5 % abv , you could drink this like welch 's fruit juice all night . overall , a quality offering from cantillon , and would like to try a fresh one sometime . wild artwork too !"

S"a : pours a light , pale wheat color with a minimal amount of frothy white head . carbonation bubbles rise from the base and lacing forms around the glass as you drink . s : smells of wheat , yeast , cereal grains and malts , honey and the slightest hint of lemon . not much else is discernible ( it is not a very complex or powerful aroma , but rather on the dull side ) . t : a very wheat dominant flavor , much like the smell ; cereal grains and malts , yeast , honey and lemon citrus . finishes dry with a lingering wheat , yeast and citrus taste . a simple beer , but not unpleasant . m : this very light bodied beer , unsurprisingly comes off as watery . there is n't much substance to it , but it does make for a very smooth drink . carbonation levels are ample but not overpowering and it feels nice on the tongue . d : the light characteristics of this beer coupled with the smooth mouthfeel make it very drinkable . a good session beer at a bar i would say . not my favorite wheat beer by far , but not something i would shy away from either ."

S"so , the other day , i was shopping for beer , and i saw a very nicely designed can with a fall mountain nature scene on it that caught my eye . i knew busch has a bad reputation , but i am always looking to save a few bucks , and i have in the past enjoyed some similarly rock-bottom priced brews like national bohemian and pabst blue ribbon when times were tough or i needed to save money , so i thought it was worth a try . after all , i 'd never had it before , and everything 's worth trying once , especially if it 's cheap . unfortunately , this is just a flat-out awful beer . it reminded me of milwaukee 's best . the beer had this strange metallic taste without really any hint of any of the basic ingredients you 'd hope to find in beer -- like it was a bad mix of corn syrup , metal , and water ; and i think they actually went light on the corn syrup and heavy on the metal . i realize that almost all beers in the sub-premium price category ( below typical macros ) are probably short on `` real '' beer ingredients , but some of them taste like they at least have a little bit , at least have pleasant faux-beer flavors . i can enjoy some really cheap beers , but not busch . this just fails on almost every conceivable level taste wise . i will say that it was fairly thin , so i was able to finish the can despite it 's bad taste , but it was bad enough that i gave away the other 5 cans of the 6-pack . i knew i 'd never drink them , which is saying something , because once i 've paid for it , i 'll get around to drinking almost anything eventually just on principle . if i lived in a world where there was nothing but busch beer , i 'd stop drinking beer ."

S"when i poured this , i could have sworn it was a maibock , rather than a doppelbock , but then , what do i know . nice thick lasting light-tan head over a medium brown body . smell is nice and malty , but not intense . still , lots of chocolatey malts . taste is a little bit lighter than the aroma . perhaps a bit heavy on the hops and light on the malt for a d-b . mouthfeel was also a bit thin . when i see `` doppelbock , '' my first thought is always `` liquid bread , '' and when you consider why the german monks first brewed this style -- as a way to get plenty of protein while fasting through the dayllight hours during lent -- it makes sense that the dominating character of this beer should be `` chewiness . '' this one was a bit light in the tooth . not a hint of the 8.5 % abv in this -- very drinkable . overall , a nice beer , and thanks to shbobdb for the incredible trade !"

S"appearance - a slightly hazed orange/yellow . i 'm using the new sam adams glass and the beer is yellower down low and has more orange tint in the bowl area above . a fat three fingers of foam takes a while to subside so i can pour in the rest . a little sediment at the end , no problem . the head has a dry clump in the middle and a thick meringue of lace around the glass . aroma - intensely piny to the point where it smells pretty much like mint leaves . herbal and grassy , a fine aroma . taste - a great start absolutely ruined . the hops are there , but as with the four horsemen i had previously , there is something *up* with this beer . an unpleasant sourness that bespeaks some sort of defect . some metal to go along with does n't help either . not one drainpour in 800 reviews and now 2 in one week , go figure . the hops are covering some of the bad flavor , but i keenly remember it from the 4h . enough . mouthfeel - the feel has the beginning of some smoothness there , carbonation level is n't half bad . drinkability - i 'm getting gun shy towards this brewery . i 'm beginning to wonder if all their beers have this sour taste to them . the chances of me trying this on tap are slim due to availability , so this one 's a one and permanently done for me ."

S"this english ale poured buckeye brown with exceptional clarity and a thin , short-lived head . it smells like intense sweetness in the malt -- brown sugar , perhaps . after the tingle of carbonation and hops comes an extreme chocolate-caramel flavor . it 's tasty , but it lacks balance until the ash-y finish comes to round it out . a very enjoyable beer !"

S"chilled 10 fl . oz bottle with a funky blue enamel coating . no indication of bottling dates etc . poured in to a half liter stein . pours a deep dark espresso coffee color with only a very slight cola hue when held to the light . the activity of the beer whilst pouring is also note worthy . during the pour the beer is behaves almost as if its flat however once its let to sit the brew generates a relatively huge mass of foamy tan head . mine measured just on 3 fingers . the head fades away to a lumpy and rocky thick surface coating with plenty of sticky lace left behind to confirm the story . the aroma swoons with roasted malt . definite chocolate notes and mild hints of coffee . taste focuses initially on a sweet and syrupy coffee flavor . the mocha feature is definitely there and once again that taste of natural and unprocessed dark chocolate balances the palate out nicely . i should also note that the mocha and choc flavors in particular have an almost burnt quality to them . medium bodied with a very smooth , earthy and almost grainy mouthfeel . low carbonation , even though it can generate a very thick and full mass of head . rich textures and well balanced flavors . once again , as i usually add when discussing stouts , porters , belgian quads etc , this is great for those that appreciate the style . if you have n't had something like this before you are either going to love it and begin a new fascination in rich flavored porters or you are going to hate this and spit it out . for me though , this is a very good offering although not exactly top shelf ."

S"appearance : pours a lot like a typical hefeweizen , which is interesting given the style and amount of alcohol . the color is somewhere between yellow and orange , with a heavy amount of haze . carbonation looks heavier than expected , but that may be a result of the light color . decent-sized head . smell : nowhere near as strong as expected . i picked up some small hints of the tea and some spices , mostly nutmeg . taste : very complex and sweet , with the warming alcoholic taste of a strong belgian . there are many different tastes here to pick up , but the chai tea and juniper berries stand out the most . mouthfeel : feels like gargling maple syrup . drinkability : it tastes interesting , but i ca n't see myself drinking more than one bottle due to the syrupy mouthfeel and high alcohol . with my lack of access to finnish beers , i doubt i will have anything like this ever again . given the disgusting mouthfeel , i 'm not sure if that 's a good or a bad thing ."

S'pellucid dark golden hue . thin , but persistent porcelain white head yields attractive lace . mild corn sweetness offset by hints of floral hops and bready malt . the flavor is a facsimile of the aroma . immaculately clean , breezy corn sweetness with floral hop hints . toasty vienna malt hints struggle to poke through . very lightly bittered , but well attenuated and dry overall . almost bland , but quite thirst quenching regardless . surprisingly dextrinous in mouthfeel considering the percentage of corn in the grist . an innocuous , no frills brew akin to a more robust and cleaner pacifico clara . practically inhalable , but not quite suited to a wintertime release . a fun change of pace , nonetheless .'

S"consumed november 11th , 2010 in ( fittingly ) a sierra nevada pint glass . beer pours a clear deep brown ; think a cola with a few ice cubes that have melted in it . a one finger head somewhere between off-white and tan forms on initial pour and reduces to a thin crown of sticky foam within a few minutes . plenty of active carbonation . aroma is full of vanilla and maybe a hint of pumpkin . also kind of a rotten odor . not so great . flavor is slightly off - oxidization and mineral notes compete with sulfur . significantly bitter for a brown ale . a metallic note as well . some toasty , nutty malt goodness in there , but it 's being covered by these competing off flavors . medium bodied with a touch of carbonation tingle . this is just not a good beer ; where did the mighty sn go wrong ? this drinks more like an indian wells product ... drain pour ."

S'the third of three michelobs i tried tonight . the other two being dunkelweisse and ginger wheat . served 55 degrees in glass shortly after pour . after two phenomenally uninspiring brews , i came across a surprising winner form the big breweries . solid across the board with none of the chemical tastes the other two suffered from , simple , straightforward hops profile with a fairly standard carbonation and presentation . poured well with a small head lingering for about 3 minutes . ( actually , both the smallest and longest lasting of the three ) . moderate sedimentation at the bottom . there was little that stood out about the brew , but it was a solid presentation none the less . neither overly malty nor especially bitter , moderate carbonation , mouthfeel held up without being overpowering . taste began crisp , followed with a moderate hoppiness , pleasant hops profile ( challenger hops possibly ? ) and a clean finish .'

S"bud ice was one of my favorites back when i was in college , but that was a long time ago . i do n't think i 've had it since then , so it 'll be interesting to see how i like it now ... . 24 ounce can . served in a pint glass , the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch white head that did n't stay around too long . there 's a small amount of lacing left on the glass . aroma is bready/grainy and sweet malt , not much else to it . with that being said , the aroma is n't offensive . taste is similar to the aroma , it 's mostly bready and sweet malt with a metallic bitter taste noticable . mouthfeel/body is light , and it has good carbonation . drinkability is n't bad at all , it 's easy enough to drink . i certainly would n't make a point to drink this very often , but for $ 1.29 a can it 's not bad . and when you buy bud ice , you pretty much know what you 're getting ."

S"picked this up as part of sam adams `` holiday celebrations '' variety pack . poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic . freshness date of june 07 . a - pours a porter dark , somewhat like dark coffee . nice 2 finger fluffy tan head that lasts . lots of lacing as it goes down . brown-amber highlights . s - wonderful hops with caramel , chocolate , and other malt aromas . you can smell the bitterness of the hops and sweetness of the malts within . the entire smell has a roasted tinge to it , which gives it a winter feel . t - roasted hops , caramel , chocolate , bittersweetness , full bodied , and complexities abound . i really enjoy this brew , though it 's not quite as good as their cream stout . a great porter - much better than others i 've had . i pulled this straight out of the box and it was wonderful on a cold night . m - the carbonation and alcohol dance around the tongue , not to mention flavors . this brew is smooth , but a bit on the heavier side , as a porter should be . pleasant . d - as far as all the varieties in the pack are concerned , this is my second favorite behind the cream stout . this is a great brew from sam adams . i would pick up a 6 or 12 of this and be more than happy . very drinkable with a good enough abv that it wo n't knock you on your ass , but that it tastes like a porter ."

S"presentation : 12oz brown pop top squat bottle , 2010 vintage ... been wanting to try this nc offering for some time now appearance : pours an attractive sienna hue with just a ghost of sediment in suspension . a creamy ivory head soon fades to almost nothing , not too surprising in a beer of this strength i suppose smell : very attractive . steely dark/burnt caramel , lots of vinous dark fruit , some warm toasty bread , and just a hint of alcohol poking through , though as this warms , the booze is becoming quite a bit more prominent . i do n't think this is gon na be quite as mild mannered ( at least fresh ) as i was thinking ... taste : mild caramel malts , a bit of vinous dark fruit , hint of woodiness ( even though i 'm pretty sure this is n't oaked in any way ) and a hint of bitter vanilla . and a whole ton of booziness . not much in the way of hop flavor , but there is a medium , firm bitterness , which tries to hold the alcohol and malt sweetness in check , and succeeds for the most part . this is one of those beers that 's just too hot during it 's first year imo . you ca n't get much flavor out of it , the booze just kinda tromps all over everything else . i 'm not saying this is a bad beer ; i 'm gon na pick up one or two more from the single bottle shelf , but i 'm deft . gon na hold on to 'em for a year or so at least . whereas some of my favorite old ales ( curmudgeon jumps readily to mind ) are great aged or fresh , this one just really is n't that attractive imo right now . mouthfeel : silky smooth drinkability : 1 and done conclusion : as a fresh beer , this does n't work too well . i will gladly put a couple in the cellar , however , and see what a little bit of time does to it ."

S'appearance - no light getting through any part of the belgian glass . a thick finger of light tan foam holds at a partial cover , leaving dotted lace behind . aroma - good roasted crystal malt nose , a robust grain staying around after things settle . taste - a good roasty level , minimal char . not very intense but quite flavorful . solid espresso notes , just a touch of burnt flavor , rather nice ! mouthfeel - even , smooth , average body , right on . carbonation is up there . drinkability -a most sessionable stout . not overly filling but very tasty .'

S'this beer was mostly average . the appearance was not as good as many other brown ales that i have seen . it looked very watery . it was crystal clear and had little to no head that left no lace . the smell was of sticky malty sweetness . very nice and mild aroma , definitely not offending . the taste was of the smell , very malty . there was subtle hop flavor in the end but it was mostly just malt and more malt . there was not anything very distinct about this . the mouthfeel was pretty good despite the watery appearance . overall a very drinkable brew but i would much rather have other brown ales .'

S'pours a deep dark black with a tall creamy tan head that sticks around for a long time . aromas of burnt coffee , malt and slight alcohol . very intriguing . tastes of burnt coffee and black malt , with a pleasant bitterness and a dry finish . more carbonation than i expected , but it goes well with the flavor . the high alcohol content is not as evident as it was in the nose ; i could not even discern the slightest alcohol flavor . drinkability is understandably low - but really , one of these bad boys is all you need . a wonderfully complex and tasty stout . i will have to check out more beers from north coast , as this was my first .'

S'the beer poured light straw golden . the head was white and stood tall finally slipping back to the surface of the beer and staying around to lace the glass . the aroma is light , crisp , and slightly malty . upon first opening a bright saazlike hop aroma was present , but that quickly flashed off . the flavor has a fruitiness that is out of character for a lager . the beer is crisp , but not clean in flavor . the finish goes fruity dry and leaves you wanting another swallow so the resultant drinkability is good . the body is light . not a bad beer , the fruitiness is not what was expected in a lager . 12 ounce bottle . the bottle is a very light brown color with a pretty nifty label .'

S"another sample acquired from the great trader joe1510 . thanks joe ! it pours a very dark brown with some reddish hues peaking through . the foam is a good 2 finger 's worth . the smell has notes of roasted malt , dark fruits , light chocolate , and a bit of alcohol . there 's some hop bitterness here as well but the strongest feature in the aroma is boubon . the taste is also of roasted malt some chocolate and toffee , tasty notes of coffee , but i 'm not tasting any dark fruits i noted in the smell but that 's easily compensated for by nice tasty bourbon followed quickly by vanilla . i had to take a few sips before i realized how complex this brew is . ; ^ ) the mouthfeel borders on full with medium carbonation . the foam really sticks around and leaves lots of lacing . drinkability ? the taste sure keeps me happy though i 'd say the alcohol is n't hidden all that well as i get lots of warming after every swallow . this is a sipper and i 'll treat it as such so major problems on that point . i 'm really glad i got a chance to try this one and can recommend it ."

S"ironically the label says it is `` pale in name only '' , which could more fittingly read `` ale in name only '' - quite clearly this is a lager ! aware that this beer has been around for some time , i initially thought this is one of those aberrations of australian beer nomenclature that has stuck ( like victoria bitter ) , but the reason was clarified by when i visited the brewery . the person i spoke with there said that yes it was a lager - it did start off as an ale , but the alcohol content was rather high - so to reduce the abv they `` changed the recipe '' , whilst keeping the name . turning it into a lager seems a bit more than fine tuning to me , but there you go . so now we 've established it 's a lager , is it any good ? well sadly i have to say that i find this a dreadful insipid beer , whatever type it is . on the positive side , like most cascade beers it does produce a good head and lacing , and there 's a good balanced level of carbonation . however , it has so little aroma and taste i just can not get anything from it . i hesitated to give such low marks , but i 've tried to give this beer a go a few times and i honestly can not think of many beers i have been so thoroughly disappointed with ."

S"bottle courtesy of dbhog - thanks a bunch for this longtime want . the mother of all bohemian lagers ( allegedly ) was split w/ dkachur , w/ my portion poured into a tulip . appearance : pours a crisp , translucent golden body , capped by a magnificent foamy , sticky white head , the retention on which was amazing . the lacing is also fantastic for the style , stringy and delicate but sticky nonetheless . the carbonation is also off the hook , fast and fine-bubbled , plentiful and well-dispersed . just a very attractive beer . aroma : one word : honey nut cherrios . ok , that 's three words , but still . i acknowledge that my tulip is concentrating and focusing the aroma differently than dan 's glass , but i get overwhelmingly honey-like , cereal-like notes , sweet and wholesome , faintly reminiscent of caramel and oats , very robust . it 's backed up by a light , faintly grassy hop presence , light and delectable . taste : essentially the nose , but more balance . huge cereal-like malts , oaty , wholesome , slightly roasted with overtones of caramel and dry toffee . it 's not overly sweet though , and what is there is cut well by a grassy , slightly spicy , faintly citrusy hop presence and a mild , mild backing bitterness . just a very down-to-earth , wholesome , `` local '' tasting beer . damn fine . mouthfeel : again , very , very good . perhaps a hair thicker than i 'd expect a pilsener to be , but that 's really my only complaint . the carbonation is plentiful and fine , lending enough crispness that it works well with the flavor profile . drinkability : the best czech pilsener ever ? best one i 've ever had , at least . i imagine this is what lagers/pilseners tasted like back when they tasted like ... well , anything , wholesome and balanced , crisp and clean . the abv % on this ca n't be above 5.5 % or so , and is probably even lower , so kudos to new glarus for once again making an eminently sessionable , enjoyable , delicious brew with all natural , local ingredients , keeping the old school brewing tradition alive ."

S"still sipping away on this one ... poured into a normal water glass ( visiting a place where they do n't drink beer ) . it is an incredibly inky black colour with a short deep brown head that was not long lasting , but kept lacing for the last half hour . i can smell a sweet maltyness on the nose of the beer . it is an interesting beer . quite complex , it is sweet and bitter , but has a lingering aftertaste that to me is reminiscent of drambuie . the alcohol character is quite strong to me . i have had stronger beers that have less of an alcohol feel . this to me is the drawback to the beer in both flavour and drinkability . glad to have tried it , but i know i wo n't be jumping back to buy this one again .

S"a clouded straw-colored body gives rise to a huge and sticky off-white head . this brings a lot of floured sourdough in the nose for something boasting fresh hops . given time it gathers a domineering persona of pine needles , mint leaves , sea salt , and grass . it enters the mouth with a steady shortbread maltiness that gathers towards white grapes over time ( but never gets there ) . hops add a variety of pepper , mint , and evergreen . but for what it is , they never truly assert themselves , even though this is one of the most compulsively drinkable hop combinations i 've come across . it 's mostly salty , and thus assures rapid drinking . the malt never supports a body that can support the hops . from a rating standpoint , it 's dry and hoppy and drinkable , and virtually uninteresting aside from that . the mouthfeel is equally peppered with co2 . it 's a bit rasping and abrasive . and never settles down . this is a very decent apa , but it is that and nothing more ( and quite salty as such ) . do n't let your hopes run higher than that . i feel like i 'm overrating it ... i like it . but it 's a far cry from stuff like great divide 's fresh hop harvest ale ."

S"edit : we 've since discovered this shipment was actually 6.5 % . no wonder the extra alcohol content was n't detectable ! southern tier unearthly , despite the considerably higher alcohol , is n't that much different than their ipa . and that 's a considerable achievement given that it kicks things up another 5 % . my 11 bottles came on a private order ( the 12th being given as a thank you to my amazing in laws that gave them to me as a gift ) . the appearance is pleasing in color , a medium golden brown with with some reddish highlights . there 's little head and no lacing to speak of . the smell is of sweet orange fruit mostly but you can pick up the hops as well . taste-wise things are cranked up a notch . lots of fruity sweetness initially and a burst of pine like hops towards the end balances things out nicely . the alcohol is there but you would never ever guess it was 11 % . southern tier has done a great job hiding it . mouthfeel is pleasing.. silky smooth with a tiny prick of carbonation . drinkability rates average for it 's style.. no one in their right mind is going to be packing away many of these in a session !"

S"very potent dopple bock ( hence the trippel bock name ) . smells very sweet , like melted sugars cooking over a stove . various dried fruits seem present as well . bananas maybe ? again , the dried variety . deep rich brown in color , almost no head whatsoever . thin lace around the sides just after pour stays long after you 've left . taste is a burst of alcohol , almost a liqueur , mixed with sweetness . just too potent . the alcohol really kicks in here . i suppose that it would turn into an infinitely more interesting brew if it was a given a few years to cellar . might make it more drinkable too ."

S'it pours a nice deep mahogany with a slight orange hue to it . a nice off-white stands tall and laces nicely . there are strong aromas of typical pumpkin pie spice that all balance nicely . the taste is mostly spices with ginger , mace , and all spice being up front.the middle is where the malts comes through along withe the pumpkin . the finish has a nice cinnamon taste to it . malt stands strong and holds it all together very well . the mouth feel is light and warm . but not from alcohol . it is a perceived notion of pumpkin pie . very pleasant . all in all , the best pumpkin ale out there . i enjoy it thoroughly .'

S"burnished gold body floats a fluffy , tight-bubbled , sticky head . very good , style-appropriate aroma , with spicy , slightly funky hops supported by a mild grainy malt backbone . slightly sweet on the palate at first , followed by juicy , bitter hops and a touch of cream . the finish is hot and dry . medium bodied , rolls around the mouth easily without any dextrine quality . the watchword here is `` balance .

'' what precisely qualifies as a winter spice , i dunno . dark amber with a splotchy , varied-bubble-size head . smells like poor malts , adjuncts maybe ( i did n't think they did that ) , a hint of cinnamon , something very sweet , reminds me of maple syrup . tastes flat and like rice . again , i thought they did n't do that ... thin-bodied but a good texture . budweiser-esque palate gives way to a cloying , sticky zing . not impressed ."

S'appearance : pours an apricot nectar color with burnt orange highlights ; the modest amount of foam quickly declines to a ringlet smell : fig , bubblegum and a dollop of toffee taste : figgy , up front , but a souring medicinal element kicks in rather quickly ; by mid-palate , however , a caramel sweet tone starts to subsume the other flavors , while adding a fusel alcohol character to the fray ; after the swallow , the alcohol and fruit flavors buttress the finish mouthfeel : medium to full body with low carbonation drinkability : age has not been particularly kind to this beer ; though the complexity is intriguing , it is all over the map and the sum is not equal to the parts'

S"there 's one very simple problem with this beer -- so strangely lauded in maritime canada : it 's not an ipa . it ca n't 'pass ' as an ipa be it from britain , the us ( ha ! ) , or south africa . keith 's is an above average macro lager with a nice aftertaste , but market it as an ipa , and it 's rating will always suffer . it is a hay yellow with a fizzy head , no hop presence in aroma or taste . to its credit , it does have a crisp finish , and a good balance in all-around flavor . as a macro lager , it is significantly better than any of the major american offerings , on par with canada 's alpine lager ( another beer from the maritimes ! ) the day that the folks out in nova scotia stop marketing this is an ipa and sell it for what it is will be the day that i give this a higher rating . if you want a decent macro lager , this will do . if you wa n't an ipa , caveat emptor : that 's not what you 're getting in keith 's ."

S"looks like a regular porter , dark , opaque ; like coffee . head was bubbly and tan in color . it dissolved rather quickly though . aroma was a mix of alcohol , roasted malts , and some sort of sweetness . taste had a mix of alcohol , a raisin-chocolate sweetness to it , and roasted malt bitterness as well . good and thick , but could have used a little more carbonation so it would 've have felt like a thin syrup . not too heavy for a 7.2 % abv , so that 's good . but the body is too thick to have multiple bottles ."

S'75oml corked and caged bottle poured into a snifter . thanks to kstrickler for this one ! ( a ) - pours fairly thick and pitch black . produced a great tan colored foamy head with great retention . minimal lacing . ( s ) - a good mellow roasted profile with some cocoa , raisin , and molasses . very dry too . some woody spice aspects . minimal coffee notes in the background . ( t ) - a very dry profile . some good roasted aspects and mellow sweetness . extremely dry with some potent woody characteristics . the bourbon is not shy in this as it warms . ( m ) - a good carbonation level . this is extremely dry with some mellow rich roasted characters . as this warms up , it turns into rocket fuel with its boozy heat . ( d ) - its showed promise , but this needs at least a few years before i would even touch it again . the boozy heat throws its weight around very much . perhaps the booziest beer i have had . 11.6 % abv ? it really feels more like 20 % +'

S"and i thought i 'd never try it ! i found a 4-pack of `` kbs '' ( apparently that 's what it goes by now ) and finally got to have this very very well-regarded beer . poured it into my snifter glass ... it poured the darkest brown possible . motor oil in a glass . i poured fairly aggressively and the smallest head bubbled up after every last drop had been transferred to the glass . the only thing i can compare the head to is a tar pit . imagine if you will a woolly mammoth sinking into the dark pit and then , after sinking , the last we see of the extinct beast are the bubbles rising to the top of the tar pit . that 's the head of kbs ; blink , and you 'll miss it . small amount of lacing on the glass ... just dark , brown bubbles clinging ever so briefly . the smell is incredible . hands down one of the most aromatic stouts i 've ever had the pleasure of putting my nose to . chocolate , coffee with a vanilla bourbon/oak back ... and even some deep , rich fruit aromas linger . the taste is also impressive . big , bold sweet and bitter dark chocolate ( if you do n't like chocolate i really ca n't recommend this ) . at first , it tastes a little like a coffee liquor but it is certainly more than that . a little too sweet at first but by the time i was on my fourth sip i was getting waves of the smallest hop flavor and faintest hint of booze that served to balance out the cakey richness very well . definitely one of those journey beers where each sip is a little bit different . the lack of carbonation ( accompanied by the sometimes overly sweet taste ) was an itty bitty problem for me . the mouthfeel is actually very good in the sense that it is oh so smooth and oily ... it coats your mouth perfectly . thick - but not too thick . it 's hard to rate kbs ' drinkability . on the one hand , this beer is not intended to be a session beer . on the other : is a truly great beer not intended to make you want another one on some level ? i can honestly say that , while i enjoyed the kbs i had quite a lot , i did not immediately following its consumption really want another . it was real smooth though , like dark silk gravy ."

S"i did n't know what to expect going into this one , but was surprised ! it poured caramel-coloured hazy brown ( kind of weird actually , almost rootbeer-like ... ) , the head was nicely bubbly , not too dense , and stayed up well . there was less of the typical orange and clove thing that one might expect from a regular wheat beer ... instead , you get red apple , spice , vanilla , malt ( none bursting out , but muted and subtle ) ... then sweet caramelized sugar . the taste had lots of that spiced character contrasted with crisp red apple , biscuity flavours , earthiness , a hint of cherry and bitterness as well as that late caramelized sweetness . really nice and lots of different layers . mouthfeel was delicately balanced : just enough body weight and fullness , but still very crisp and clean . there 's a lingering dryness from the wheat at the end of the sip . it 's not as delightfully quaffable as its traditional wheat siblings , but makes up for it with loads more complexity !"

S"i will admit a very strong bias towards the style of porter . i love it . could be my blue-collar roots , could be it 's because blackhook was the first dark beer i truly loved , i do n't know . what i do know is that i tend to judge most breweries on the quality of their porter . if they do n't have one ( or have a bad one ) , i do n't tend to drink their beers at all ( deschutes would be a notable exception to this rule , as i drink the crap out of cinder cone , but do not care for black butte at all ) . fear not , citizen , harmon makes a spectacular porter ( one of the top two in the puget sound , as far as i 'm concerned ) . appearance : murky , unfiltered , deep , dark , swamp water brown . mild off-white head that disappears fairly quickly after i empty the bottle into my glass . held up to the light , there are light brown hints around the edges . this is how i figure porters truly looked back in 18th and 19th century london . smell : mmmm ... malts . no hint of hops whatsoever . it almost has a caramelly smell , with a very faint hint of roasted malt bitterness in the end . very , very nice . taste : understand , the historical background of porter fascinates me . this beer has its roots in the unhopped british ale tradition , with wood-fired malts and local water . starts off with a small bit of malty sweetness in the beginning ( again , back to that caramel or brown sugar sensation ) , then just sits on the tongue with this marvelous kahlua-esque presence of alcohol warmth and coffee bitterness . i love this beer . mouthfeel : too thin , and a porter is just wrong . too thick , and you cross over into stout territory . this occupies that vaunted viscosity middle ground that i love so very much in my session beers . perfect , i say , perfect . drinkability : hard '5 ' from me on this one . i can session the crap out of this beer , and have on many , many occasions . i was a little forlon the last time i popped into harmon , as they were out of the porter , so i had to settle for the esb ( which i like very much as well ) . it 's all for the best , really , as i 'm sure i would have drank too damn much of it anyway ."

S"12 oz . bottle . pours a deep reddish-orange with great clarity . a small tan head starts out well , then disappears almost completely , save for a ragged ring of bubbles around the edge . lots of citrusy and piney hops on the nose . chinook ? a bit of sweet , caramelly malt adds a sharp undercurrent . the flavor starts out firmly bitter , with a lot of citrus ( grapefruit rind ) and pine , before the malts show up and add a bit of balance . some fruitiness . high lovibond crystal malt caramel sweetness is resigned to play second fiddle to the hops . a bit thin and light-bodied , with a slighty weak carbonation level which helps by adding a tiny hint of a syrupy mouthfeel . ends with a touch of dryness , which adds to drinkability . highly quaffable at 4.4 % abv , this would make a good session brew if i could get it here in missouri . thanks to winomark for bringing me arrogant bastard ale 's milder , little brother !"

S'12oz bottle as part of the limited release belgian series variety pack . purchased at the brewpub , big thanks to frozensoul 327 ! pours extremely dark for a saison , a bronzed over copper colour . head that last only along the outside of the glass . plenty of barnyard funk , long pungeant yeast sourness . quite strong with notes of rotting pear , apple , grapes . leaves alot to smell ! mouthfeel not as sour as others in the series . this still rather yeasty , but showcasing a real toasty ( not quite roasted , just lightly toasted ) malt bill . some lingering caramel , flavours a little too mild . the yeast really works well with the taste . soft malty aftertaste . certainly getting the funk . i found it a little different for a saison but was quite interesting .'

S"thanks to stormking47 for providing me with two months worth of hops in a single box . that 's service ! poured with great anticipation , as everything light & bunny fluffy from port trips my tigger . screamingly carbonated , the dual dumps into our new holland glasses foam like boiling mac & cheese . wait for it . smell is pale malts , fresh bread , green growing grass . only the far-off whiff of metal inhibits the pleasure . panzer imperial pilsner reminds me of sam adams noble pils ... a lot , with a little more hop bite . a very hop forward imperial guy ; hops of the earthy , bitter , pine box , & grapefruit variety entertain the palate . alcohol is more present than any pils , royalty or no , that i 've ever sampled , leaving moonshine on the breath . sweet spiciness , almost rye-like , envelopes the senses on the back end , mingling with the leavings of hop bitterness . honestly , i did n't think i was too wild about this , but my left hand wo n't stop lunging for the glass . fall crispness , hyperactive carbonation , smoothness , all conspire to lure me back again . at 9.5 % this would be a blackly dangerous beer to find on tap with keys jingling in your pocket . very good beer , highlighted by the drinkability of water after a 40 mile bike ride . port ? any time you want to branch out to minnesota , & bring your hops with you , i 'm game . thanks ."

S"12 oz bottle . clear copper in color . fizzy , rocky , white head . head faded very quickly . slight carmel malt smell upfront . not much else , some faint flowerly hop presence . not much else . taste was much the same , nice sweet carmel malt taste to start . just a hint of bitterness . slight bitter and slick aftertaste . lacks any real body . very thin . watered down finish . the initial taste is fine , then the beer just falls apart . not sure what style this actually is . not really a marzen , or vienna or oktoberfest as it is listed . more of a hybrid dark lager with carmel malt taste . very muddled and uninspiring . i would take to a leine 's red or killians as much as this one ."

S'poured a 12oz bottle into my chimay chalice . this beer poured almost a dirty dishwater/muddy water brown with a creamy beige 1 inch head and left no lacing at all . the aroma is wheat , clove , and vanilla . the taste is bananas with a bit of clove . there is also an odd roasted wheat aftertaste that leaves a burnt taste on the back of the throat . this beer also seems pretty hot to me . it has a definite boozy kick to it and leaves a pretty spicy coating on the tongue . the mouthfeel is full but spiciness is off putting . i think this actually might be my least favorite sam adams brew tried to date .'

S'amber color . nose very light , almost impossible to detect odors inside . strange mouth , sparkling with spices as little noting in a beer ( salt ? ) . the finish , the bitterness out of nowhere a little ( or hops or malt and others ) , which is quite surprising . finally , far from being comparable to the belgian tripel . here , the beer - although not fundamentally foul - has a body too small ( one also wonders what happened to the abv of 8.5 as they are non-existent ) and suffers from a deficiency in flavor too blatant competition to claim the belgian model . too far to beat belgian triple .'

S"12 oz bottle that i 've cellared for a few months , poured into my delirium snifter , quinoxe du printemps is copper with a large off-white head that is very thick , slow to subside , leaving heavy hunks of foamy lace . impressive , especially for the style . also , another cool label , i always dig their artwork . smell is pretty boozy , some sweet malt , maple . taste is pretty fuselly , not much malt character , a little maple comes out as it warms , but this one is really lacking depth for my taste . mouthfeel is very dry , medium body . drinkability is n't too high . it 's a pretty hot beer that 's not terribly interesting to drink . while i got it in trade ( thx northyorksammy ! ) , their beers are generally on the pricey side , which certainly does n't help ."

S'found these in the small bottle . with no one to share with tonight , it made for the perfect after dinner size . a : thick dark chocolate color . ( see image above ) there is no light shining through this one . nice thick light brown head results from a standard pour . s : hints of dark roasted coffee and strong alcohol . t & m : mild bitter beginning followed by serious explosion of coffee , chocolate and chestnuts . sap splatterd tree bark comes to mind for some reason . this is decadent chewy and complex for sure . as with all of the quality stouts , mouth swishing recreates the taste cycle and brings out more subtle characteristics . i think i am now getting some plums and black pepper . d : oh no , not more than one of these . the bitter ending and high alcohol make it prohibitive . the alcohol is strongly apparent but i would not have guessed it to be close to 11 abv . a drinkable offering as compared to others in the same abv class . all dark beer lovers need to try this one . it is a great representation of the style , and has some unique qualities to it . powerful brew indeed .'

S"a really good-looking beer when poured into a pint glass . the body is a darkish hazy orange and the head is frothy and plentiful . the lacing action is fantastic and it actually made me want it more the more i drank . the smell of this beer is it 's one apparent weakness , i think . it smells sort of musky and hoppy with very little else going on . not even worth a sniff . the taste is really good ... and i think underrated . this is not a hop-lover 's pale ale as it is n't particularly bitter nor does it assault your taste buds . however , the malt and fruit sweetness is really good and understated . it suffers only from the classic metallic taste that bell 's non-specialty beers always seem to have . what is that from anyway ? one of the things i like most about this pale is how chewy it is in the mouth . the carbonation is just right and it 's got a nice aftertaste . the aftertaste lasts and it sort of leaves your mouth feeling oily . i liked it , but it may not be for everyone and it 's probably atypical of what you want from a pale ale . i do n't drink a lot of pales though and liked the thick feel this one provided . it 's a beautiful beer that i find eminently drinkable ... from bottle or from the glass . i 'd recommend the glass because of how nice every aspect of this beer looks . if you can get over the lack of good aroma and the slight metallic tinge it has , this would be a very enjoyable pale ale for you ."

S"a friend of mine brought this back from wisconsin to drink while watching the gb game . pours a thick ruby color , hazey , some floaters . off white/red head , minimal strength , some staying power . aroma hits at first as a cherry bomb-cough syrup , but it has a nice biscuit hint mixed in there . semi sweet . not as strong as the lindeman 's kriek , a bit more complex . taste was cherry filled , sweet , sticky . phenols make the cherries feel fake and syrupy . a thick feel to it with a small bite in the back to soften the syrup feel . a good brew , but not very drinkable to me ."

S'eeenteresting.. gold color with orange hues , clear and bubbly . carbonation creates an airy crown , slippery and slimy . smells hoppy.. as other reviewers have said , a dead-ringer for orval.. that lemon twisted hop freshness funked up by the mildest hint of brettanomyces . if anything , maybe this has a bit more lemon rind to it , and a hint of bready yeast . not quite as sour as i remember the others , this one is more of a basic belgian pale with slighter hop/funk twists . starts off innocently , green botanical flavors and some mild bitterness from belgian malt husks . hits you with carbonation and finishes surprisingly clean.. not much left on the palate- this beer feels like more of a palate cleanser . it leaves you with that same cool , crisp feeling as mouthwash or ginger after sushi . kind of vacant flavor-wise . good shot at an orval clone , just missing something . 9 % ? yeah , this is chuggable . drinkability is the strong point with this beer . personally , i have enjoyed the previous entries in this series more , as i am more about tasting the experimental nastiness produced by wild yeast and bacteria . this beer is balanced , yet way too tame for what i expected from it .'

S"was waiting a bit , but had to grab a bomber of this just to try it.. and i am glad i did ... because so far it actually looks and seems quite good ... let 's see.. - bubbly clear caramel color ... copper penny ... huge fluffy white head ... quite slow and boiling down ... lacing in abundance.. - big citrus smell.. a little bit like a hop stoopid , but also a little bit like a fresh summit hop ... really a nice refreshing scent ... . a good smell for sure . little bit of sweet caramel and brown sugar ... - quite light ... . great bittering hop for sure.. some zesty citrus and pine hop , and also a nice dash of lemon zest and fruit.. very light and hides the strength it says it has with great ease ... actually very good ... did i get a really good bomber or what.. wondering because some of the reviews are not very favorable.. - bit dry , oily.. but light at the same time ... throws a good bitter punch.. - flavor , smell , smoothness ... high marks for sure ... but way over carbonated for my tastes in an ipa ... little bit more west coast cloudiness and less carb . and this would be an instant classic . i think some of the poor reviews are based on the fact that this is a large craft merger ... but realize that they are some of the oldest crafts and this is a new release from them to compete with a whole new world of new treats ... and i think they did quite well ."

S'this is my first beer from this brewery so looking forwards to it , it pours a cloudy apricot hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a very frothy two finger head and lacing here and there , on smell im getting apricot , tangello and some bitter grapefruit aromas , it has a pleasant mouthfeel which is between light and medium and well carbonated and on the first sip apricot stands out followed by mandarins , some light toffee and also a tiny touch of lemon zest bitterness right at the end but its not really bitter at all , overall its a nice drop thats tasty without being too complex and if it was cheaper could easily see this as a nice session beer .'

S"appearance : this is a popular brew , and the first impression that this brew leaves is excellent ! the beer pours as a nice red amber . the head is a thick off white . plentiful carbonation threads and plentiful lacings . crystal clear . excellent ! smell : heavy hop presence . some earthy pine presence . american `` c '' hops jump out at you . nice , but expected for a double ipa . taste : extended flavor curve . heavy hops kick in just after onset . malt is minor but more of a compliment to help the hops shine . there are several `` interesting things '' going on in the flavor curve . some are hard to pick out because of the heay hop presence , others compliment the hops , and others stand on there own because they stand out from the hops . this is n't the strongest ipa that i 've ever had , but it is one of the more interesting flavor character ipas . mouthfeel : very heavy on the tongue and character . this is expected for a double ipa , so this is n't necessarily bad . this would be paired well with a strong cheese , chicago pizza , or another heavy flavored item . drinkability : this brew sits very heavy on the stomach . while very tasty , the drinker will be `` done '' after just a couple . prosit ! nikki"

S"2004 bottle purchased at oak tree buy rite sometime the following year ... this has been cellared since then , patiently waiting for its big night . well , here it is ... paired with chocolate swirl cheescake , this will be served at cellar temperature in the brewery 's own oversize snifter . appearance- this beer pours a deep chocolate brown with crimson and ruby edges ... the bubbles rise just slightly , then concede and line the outside rim . there are large patches of lacing dotting the inside of the glass . smell- wowee ... this is incredibly dense and concentrated ... i 'm getting traditionally `` old ale '' aromas , including bacon and other meats , smoke , and surprisingly not a single indication of chocolate . inhaling deeply , i am sensing the alcohol strength ... an unheard of 18 % ... let 's get this in my belly ! taste- the malt profile here is lush and enormous ... here 's where some chocolate notes appear , adding just the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the overall beefiness and thickness . terrifically heavy in terms of taste , even this cheesecake is n't holding up to this one . mouthfeel/drinkability- upon pouring the remaining beer into my glass , i realize that standing up right now would be actually funny ... so i 'll elect to remain seated . the mouthfeel is fantastic , seafoamy and slick ... all of the intense flavors which have integrated so wonderfully over time are in their place , finishing with a long bitterness . this is definitely a beer to savor , slowly and without haste . pair it with something bigger than chocolate cheescake , though ... i would n't rule out a high end , exquisite meat dish in its proper reduction with roasted potatoes and savory spices . what a great culmination to an anticipated tasting !"

S"pours a reddish , ruby brown with a massive head which likes to hang around . aroma is not strong , but is woody , maybe oakish but sweeter . immediate impression is of semi-sweet or bittersweet dark chocolate , starting with out with strong chocolate flavors and finishing with lighter hoppy bitterness . the hoppiness and flavor of the finish gives a bit of an impression of a red ale rather than a brown ale , or maybe like the two escaped to the alley behind the brewery on break a few months ago . not too much malt or sweetness here on the way down but it does leave a dark porter-ish sweetness on the palate , surprising given the finish , but this sticky sweetness hangs around and hurts the drinkability . this is n't one of my favorite styles but within the style this has very good flavor , maybe because it is does not conform to the standard . the bittersweet finish does n't encourage me to grab another though , so i 'll probably pass by this one next time ."

S"i wrote a review of the 2003 edition of this beer that was quite scathing . i remember when i first had it ... it was not good at all . the beer had a very strong solvent-like quality to it , and had a `` nail-polish '' aroma . unpleasant . the 2004 was a world of difference ( hehe , get it ? `` world ? '' ) . my sample poured absolutely opaque but with more carbonation than the previous version i tried . the aroma was awesome . not too much hops.. mostly malt in this one , but with hints of roasted barley and fruity esters . and of course alcohol . the taste ? one of the most remarkbable beers i ever had . more of a liquer really ... velvety mouthfeel , slightly syrupy sweet , but with bitterness from the roasted grains and hops . very nice . i 'd love to grab a few of these and lay them down for years . i bet in 10 years they 'll be black gold . not too drinkable , but at 18 % , what is ? i drank the entire 12 oz bottle in 15 minutes and now i 'm lit . seriously , one bottle is like drinking four bottles of regular beer . try drinking four bottles of beer in 15 minutes . you get lit ."

S"a beautiful take on the belgian witbier , blanche de chambly is a great thirst quencher . came in a 750ml bomber , corked . it 's the usual cloudy , straw , hazy-gold appearance with an enormous frothy white head . tons of carbonation in one of these pups . no lacing : ( smell 's great , but nothing overwhelming ... yeasty overtones with very mild orange undertones . not as spicy as i 'd like it to smell , but not off-putting at all . taste is a little lighter and weaker than most average witbiers , not terribly complex . mostly coriander and orange , as you 'd expect . no hoppy finish , just a great thirst quencher . it feels more like a champagne than a beer , it 's super sparkly and easy to drink . it loses the majority of its sparkle by the end of a glass , but not so much that it 's flat . it 's pretty light . i think this is the beer to pound back . there 's not too much to it , so it 's easy to kill these without even noticing . this is n't my favorite witbier , but nothing to scoff at either . i 'd happily drink it again ... preferably on a ridiculously hot day on the lake : )"

S"poured this brew from a brown 12oz twist off bottle into a hefeweizen glass . this attractice reddish amber brew pours an off-white head that dwindled slowly to almost nothing , leaving a very thin lace behind . the smell is malt , lacking any other distinct flavors . it feels pretty well balanced in the mouth , but is quite watery out of the bottle . thicker out of the tap , and a more pleasant beer . the taste is malty up front , finishing with a wheat flavor that lingers on the tongue . killian 's is not hard to drink , but it is a pretty lackluster beer that does not lend itself much an enjoyable drinking experience ."

S"on vaction in victoria and had lunch at a pub with the phillip beers on tap . deep gold with a ample one inch head that laced down the pint . fresh hoppy aroma with an intial bitter taste that transitioned into a balanced , smooth herbal hoppiness . ale was extremely fresh and satisfying . i had two very enjoyable pints with picture perfect weather ( mid 70 's ) . too bad i have to head back into 100 's nashville in a few days . the good people of victoria are fortunate to have such a fine brew ."

S"12 oz . bottle . pours a reddish-brown color with a quickly diminishing light brown head . aroma is nutty and a slight hint of roasted malts , altogether kind of weak . flavor is pretty good , roasted malts , raisins , fruity , a touch of chocolate , and caramel . mouthfeel is kinda light for a doppel , quite a bit of carbonation and a roasted flavor that sticks around for a while . a pretty drinkable beer , but does n't seem quite up to style ."

S"pours a golden amber color with very good head and lacing . it 's great to see an ipa that actually follows the pale characteristic . aroma is delicate , but what you find is excellent . flowery hops with a hint of mint leaf . this is an english ipa so do n't expect a west coast hop presence and you should be pleased . taste is also excellent , with a great balance of flavors going on . sturdy bitterness , but the hop presence is mostly felt in the flavor . mouthfeel is very interesting , because there is a nice full body but it finishes more on the dry side with the hop bitterness accentuating that . at the time i had this beer , it earned a clear 5 for drinkability . i quickly was staring at the bottom of an empty pint glass , reaching for the second and final bottle from the mixed 12 pack . it was the perfect time and place for this beer , reminding me why i love good beer ."

S'poured from the bomber into a pilsner glass . body is a cloudy golden color . towards the bottom of the bottle it became a more orange even reddish color , and more cloudy . the aroma is slightly lacking from what i would expect . it did sport some nice spice and citrus/orange scents , but nothing as full bodied as i would have liked . the flavor starts with a crisp wheaty sweetness , which bleeds into slightly tart fruits including orange and banana . spices are full and strong ... clove and coriander a decent wit , but nothing special .'

S'im not sure where the oktoberfest label came from with this beer , it is more like the mexican budweiser ... very neutral grains in this beer.. much more watered down than most brews south of the border.. minimal use of corn/veggies ... very drinkable compared to corona , sol or even tecate , although must say i dont mind a little mexican corn taste as long as im actually in mexico ... at this level its really all about the same.. for some crazy ass reason we can get magnum bottles of this at the korean mart down the street ... i usually dont waste my time lol ... cheers ! ! ! !'

S"when this beer is poured into a glass , it becomes apparent that there is little texture and body . the coloring here is so thin , i would say it is closer to water than beer . however , it is crisp looking . the aroma carries a wheat-like scent . high amount of grain aroma to this one . the flavor is a yeasty concoction of cornmeal , with the ever-so-faint taste of leftover hops . actually , a very appealing flavor considering its `` light '' label . there is plenty to enjoy about its drinkability . the feel it leaves is so light and fizzy , that the ability to drink more than one is pretty much guaranteed . good for a light lager ."

S"sparkling orange body bursting with carbonation streams under a big dentable white slab of well stretched bubbles . aroma of pine and citrus , more tangerine than grapefruit , nice but somewhat disappointingly small . taste begins with a good solid foundation of sweet caramel . the hops follow up with enough juice to turn the sweetness to bitter , but its barely so , with little actual bite . fine medium mouthfeel . its easy drinking , maybe too easy drinking . while not flawed , nor is it interesting . while the name hopfish calls to mind other locals like hop devil , hop wallop , hops infusion , and hop hog , its more in line with cricket hill 's hopnotic ipa , a self described training wheel ipa ."

S'pours a crystal-clear bronze hue , with a dense and soapy three finger head just off-white in color . good retention with spotty lacing . toasty malt , light phenols , orange peel , and alcohol are prodominant aromas ; some faint styrian hops and crystal malt make up the rest . the first sip is full of dextrinous and bready toasted malt , surrounded by a fruity phenolic taste in a classic abbey-style sort of way . candy-sugar comes out next , and with it a boisterous , boozey kick . the aftertaste is drying with little but some herbal and mild hop flavor and aroma . the alcohol also helps balance out the abundant sweetess with help from a tart phenolic presence . mouthfeel is medium-full with a medium carbonation that seems passable but lacking given the style and amount of lingering flavors . indeed , the finish is quite residual and sweet , and only saved by the dryness from the booze . while this was a nice stab at the style and i really like the yeast profile and overall complexity- the preception of alcohol is out of control and far to hot the attain a respectable drinkability . the burn is slow and clean like top-shelp vodka , but ultimately too prominent even for a quad and quickly becomes distracting . perhaps a few years in the cellar would be beneficial , but it appears filtered and so would likely only fade away some of the more interesting yeast , malt and hop nuances .'

S'i received this lambic in the sam adams winter sampler , simply because i was in the mood for trying something different . i always appreciate the messages on the top of the bottle to tell you a little about the different brews . first smell , i was very impressed with the nice cranberry aroma . the first taste was very fruity , very similar to the cherry wheat , except with a very thick mouth . after the third taste i had already had it . it taste like cranberry sauce that had been in a rusty can . the taste was just too pungent for my pallette . i could definately taste the wheatness of the beer . not one of my favorites .'

S"this one has the true classic wheat beer look . a thick , cloudy gold that pours a 2 finger head . over a couple minutes , the head dissipates to lace and nothingness . this beer , besides the normal wheat cloudiness , shows a bit of what appears to be a chill haze . i think this one 's been in the cooler a while . smells of very ripe citrus fruit , grass , bread , and mulch . the flavor is resemblant of the aroma , as it shows the cirtus fruit in full tilt . people usually drink this with a lemon wedge , and for the life of me , i do n't know what the fuck for . the lemon character is already present and accounted for . importing more into the beer is ludicrous . after the initial lemon and bread and wheat field flavors dissipate on the swallow , a slight cloying sweetness shows in the end . this is a bit of a distraction because it does n't quite match the other tastes and the mouthfeel . the mouthfeel is everything you look for in a weisse , but with the sweetness , seems a bit discombobulated . drinkability takes a hit . i could drink this beer whenever i so desired , the price is right , yet i seldom do . part of this is style bias probably . contrary to how many feel , i do n't find wheat beers to be all that sessionable . one is great . but one is all i ever want in any particular week . and so it goes ... ."

S'i have had this beer twice now at a german restaurant in johnson city . i was blown away when i pared it with sauerbraten , as the rye and dry taste complemented the meal very well . i tried it again with jaeger schnitzel , not so great of a paring . the beer overrode the flavors of the food and left a sticky mouth feel after finishing the large mug . i will be having this again as the flavor is great , but with food that will stand up to this stout .'

S".5 litres poured into my frozen erdinger weissbierglas . paulaner pours yellow-orange , similar to hacker pschorr , just a touch less orange and cloudy . lots of hefe sediment in bottle swished out with the last 2-3 ozs . i immediately smell cloves and banannas . first pull is a little shocking if you 're used to american weizens , h-p or erdinger . it tastes like you 're drinking something from a bakers oven . not bad , just not particularly refreshing ... . and that 's why i squeeze a small lemon wedge and throw it through the head . one or two more pulls and i 'm in the middle of one of the best thirst cutting weizens i 've tasted ! the lemon really mellows out the cloviness and compliments it at the same time . *for the perfect pour , cut off some of the shiny lemon rind so that it imparts less bitterness . * as you near the bottom of your glass you will swear that this is nectar from heaven ! i can ( and have ) had sessioning quantities of this very fine weisbier on tap in germany and can attest to it 's consistent perfection . however , in germany it really says 'hefeweizen naturtrub ' on a ( different ) off-white label and it tastes a little different than this bottle . i think that the one we get in usa ( and the one i reviewed here ) is just called hefe-weizen ."

S"this stout beer was impressive . what first struck me was the roasted oatmeal smell that comes from the opened bottle , very exciting smell . its pours a dark brown coloring and has a 2 finger head with good lace . the taste matches the name , with a good hint of roasted oatmeal and no after taste to speak of . the drinkability of this beer is good if you can shell out 2.50 american dollars per bottle . highly recommended for those of you interested in stout 's ."

S'beeneaning to try this one for a time now . poured into 3 philosophers goblet . nice cloudy orange-mahogany color . nice head that dissipates but not completely . aromas of fruity ( plums ? ) very dry in the nose . tastes of plum and raisin but a bit too sweet for the style imo . good for the price . i wonder if a bit of age would round out the sweetness ...'

S'12 oz . bottle dated second week of august ( 1 1/2 month old ) . sadly , the last bottle from a great lakefront variety pack . appearance : pours dark brown , but not so dark that light can creep through . nice tan head of one finger that is very thick , but dissolves quickly . aroma : clean maltiness with a heavy roasted caramel/toffee scent . subtle chocolate tones . taste : everything tastes roasty and toasty . great balance here . this is most definitely malt forward , but the hops do a good job of keeping the rich caramel and chocolate sweetness from getting out of hand . flavors combine to create a coffee like aftertaste . mouthfeel : smooth and creamy , but not very heavy in body . not cloying in the least , but flavors leave a pleasant after feel on your tongue . drinkability : highly drinkable ! this would be a perfect beer for cooler weather , but crisp and refreshing enough to have year-round . overall : a stellar way to end the variety pack . i can see enjoying this one again soon during a football game . the balance and light body are what sell me on this variation of the style . it is not as robust as it could be , but i think that is one of this beers strengths .'

S"pours a crimson myriad of decadence with a moderate head that is accompanied by the same level of lacing . hints of alcohol followed by an impressive amount of caramel and blossomy hops upon initial inspection . an array of fruit is present as well to complete the spectrum . the taste solidifies this double ale 's position and superiority over his `` younger '' brother who is only half as arrogant . hoppy not overbearing . strong abv but not brutal . well balanced and impressively enjoyable throughout . a bit on the malty side , but that is par for the course in this realm . the mouthfeel is substantial in girth with lingering traces of malt and hops , followed by a syrupy finish . as the contents of the glass diminishes , the carbonation becomes more apparent , but overall this does n't detract from the overall enjoyment . slightly more enjoyable and vastly more complex than arrogant bastard ale , this is definitely an american strong ale that excels at drinkability . very well balanced between all aspect that comprise a beer that can be enjoyed for multiple iterations ."

S"i have drank more miller high life than any other beer throughout my life . despite its low quality , in my mind it will always be a good beer . i extracted a cold can from the fridge and poured the brew into a standard american pint glass . it was a golden yellow with a chalk white head that glowed in the light , i added a tad bit more head than normal . be careful with the beer 's temperature , if you are walking around with a couple in your pocket they will heat up and your head will get out of control . i like to hide them behind the frozen pizzas in the freezer at house parties ( shhhh ! ) . it smells like the end of the work week . you get a hint of hops . there is n't a great aroma that you would get in a `` good beer '' . it smells a lot like mgd , there is a small hit of malt . overall , the smell is pleasurable to the nostrils . after a big gulp full , i was initially hit with the hops and the smooth creamy head . then i experienced a void of taste that reminded me how watered down it was . high life is essentially a watered and priced down version of mgd . you also get some nice bubbles mixed in there , its almost like an over carbonated soda , but unlike soda it 's good . it goes down smooth . a very easy beer to drink yourself silly with . do n't drive while your drinking , high life will be your ride away from sobriety . high life drinkers are a band of brothers . every time a pair of high life drinkers cross paths at a party , there is a high five or a hand shake . its unique , because its a getting drunk beer that is filled with class as well as alcohol ( 4.6abv ) . i 'm going to go out and have some more , tomorrow morning will be painful ."

S'the beer is a rich brown color , with some caramel . though dark , it is very clear - not cloudy in the slightest . the head is soda-like , small , bubbly , and quickly gone . the aroma is of malt and honey . it is sweet and nutty , pecan-like , with some cinnamon . the taste is also sweet and nutty , a bit earthy , a little creamy . it is very light and clean . there is some bitterness to be had at the end , a spicy honey aftertaste . there is a moderate amount of carbonation , which provides just a little fizziness . the body is light , a bit watery , and slightly creamy . this is an easy beer to drink , and it does have some sweetness and bitterness to keep the taste buds involved . unfortunately the flavor and mouthfeel are a little weak . the head at the beginning warns you that this beer is a little on the soda-pop side .'

S"from a bottle into a pilsener glass . how appropriate ... pours a transparent golden with a bone-white head . it 's clear from the appearance this beer is loaded with carbonation . tons of tiny , little bubbles are floating to the surface . there 's a very dense head that leaved a full layer of foam on top . plenty of lacing , too . it looks like a german pilsener . well , hops . yes . it smells like hops . who would have thought . it 's actually a spot-on pilsener ( from the aroma ) , but i 'll throw it out there . it 's very spicy , which i like , and is a refreshing change from the american-style citrus-zest/tree-sap style so frequently seen now . hints of pepper and scallions are on the nose , with a full hop aroma to follow . there 's a little floral bit on the back of the nose , something like lilies and roses . really rich . yum . i was a bit worried i 'd find this beer too `` light '' or `` pale '' but it 's full of flavor . like i said previously , it 's a great contrast to the american `` over-hopped '' beers ( yes , i know it 's an american brewer , but you understand ... ) and presents a delicate and nuanced flavor . it rolls through the mouth nicely , starting with the a hint of bite and orange/grapefruit . it moves into a mixture of the barley and florals that is full and refreshing . on the tail , there 's a hint of pepper and a pleasing metallic flavor that 's reminiscent of copper . the subtle complexities are n't masked by a spicy meal , and this would stand up to lots of food . well carbonated , imparts a very light texture that approaches effervescent , but remains in the style of the best german pilseners . this would be a great session beer on a summer day . the light character would n't necessarily match with heavy bbq or burgers , but spicy bratwurst with mustard and sauerkraut would be ideal . i paired it with a spicy pasta nortea and was very , very happy . it would be great for a hot summer day by the lake with grilled fish . also , alternating sipping this with a traditional hefeweizen would make for a great summer session ."

S"my bottle was dated as being produced nov 2006 , and was of the 14.6 % abv variety . i was grateful to have the oportunity to sample this very unique beer . but i found it to be a bit punishing to drink , although its pleasures slowly revealed itself to me as i sipped away at a 12 oz bottle ( poured into a michelob celebrate glass which has never [ and will never ] contain michelob celebrate [ thanks michelob ! ] ) . this beer pours an intense ruby-red with a light white head which had good staying power . this beer succeeds at its intended mission ( as i understand it ) , which is to compete with liquors like cognac and brandy . the aroma is intensely malty , cerealy , and boozy . true to its origins as a beer , flavor was also very malty , but with an alcohol astringency and malt-ball flavor that was difficult to adjust to . as the nearly 15 % abv warmed my mouth , throat , and belly ( which took only a few sips ) , i warmed to the beer , but have trouble calling the flavor superior or the beer drinkable . mouthfeel was difficult to discern due to the intensity of this beer . but , it was not especially viscous , nor thin . i thought this beer was very unique , but a bit difficult to drink . its appeal was certainly not immediately apparent , but for an acquired taste i thought it pleasant , as evidenced by the fact i 'm looking forward to samael 's and mephistopheles waiting for me in my fridge ( for another night ... not tonight ) . recommended ."

S"saw this and was intrigued , i 've had watery brew before ( ultra ) , but amber watery brew may be different . plus the temps are climbing and a good refresher is always needed . first off looking at the carbs it actually has about 50 % more than ultra , hmmm interesting . smells like an amber brew , not outstandingly but it 's there . pours to an light amber color with a nice head . taste is thin but does have hints of an amber brew with a slight maltiness and a mild twang of hops . carbonation is n't too high but due to the lack of backbone does override the flavor . this is definitely not a connoisseur 's beer . but i doubt any connoisseur is going to buy a self proclaimed low carb brew . it is what it is . i rate it what it proclaims to be , not even next to one of my red ale homebrews . for wicked hot weather working outside , this would be tough to top . although at 5 % ac i would n't be wielding a chainsaw ."

'' and she could n't have been any more right . aroma consists of burnt and smoked malts . the hops were almost not present at all , this is a very malty beer . the taste was just overwhelming . it is not a terrible taste , but it is extremely smoky . the best way i can describe it is my uncle makes these smoked baby back ribs , and they 're really good , but you can only eat a few before the smoky taste gets to you . i will not be having this beer again , but i 'm glad i tried it . it was a struggle getting thru one of these ."

S'note : having had this amazingly complex brew before , i decided to forgo using my usual pint glass and instead opted for a snifter in order to review this one . appearance : utter and absolute darkness , this brew is entirely opaque ( even held up against a light the color does not change ) . also , a thick , creamy brown head ( with some minor ruby hues ) that sustains for quite a while . the viscous oiliness of this beer is also very impressive ( it has that somwhat rare coats the glass quality ) . aroma : a number of aromas emanate from this brew : chocolate , roasted coffee , burnt fruit , alcohol hints , and even hop bitterness . nicely earthy and complex . taste and mouthfeel : two basic , overall flavors dominate this brew : bitterness and roastiness ( or , more accurately , a burnt flavor ) . the former comes from an array of the beers flavors such as bitter cocoa , hop flavor , alcohol bite , etc. , while the latter stems from roasted coffee , burnt fruitiness , espresso , etc . all of these varying tastes complement to create a very rich and very complex brew . also , the sweetness has a port-like character . in addition to all this , the finish is long and robust . the mouthfeel is exceptionally thick and oily , with a nice carbonation tang as well . a number of words could be used to describe this truly outstanding beer rich , robust , delicious , complex , earthy , etc. , - but i think one simple word does it best : amazing . easily my favorite stout , but also one of the best out of all the beers ive ever tasted , regardless of style . the one very minor drawback , imho , is that its richness makes it somewhat difficult to finish off more than one or two of these at a time ( i been drinking the same glass of this stout for almost a half-hour and im still not done ! ) , not to mention its alcohol kick ( an 8.5 % hammer ) . but , overall , no serious craft beer drinker can afford to not try this one . highly , highly recommended ! !'

S'old crustacean was served from a silkscreened 12 oz bottle dated 2002 ( aged 2 years ) . in a pint glass , the beer was a rich and very deep and attractive mahogany brown , and was topped by a thin light brown head . the nose was extremely complex and wonderful with exploding textured roasty , mushroomy , spouted-grain , woody maltiness . irratic plumes of varnish-like alchohl caught my nose from time to time . sweet notes are present but stuggle to escape . on the palate , a big roasty , peaty malt profile with some nice cocoa nuances reared back to release searing scotch-like alcohol flavors that warmed the throat on the way down . a huge complementing bitterness came through this in the finish leaving lingering roasty , lightly astringent nutty notes . the medium body felt good for the flavors and character of the beer . as for drinkability , it suffers considerably due to the completely detached alcohol thoughout ... .i sipped it like as if it were scotch , and i barely got through the bottle . despite this harshness , the nose was amazingly developed and good flavors made it enjoyable for a while . this aged barleywine was quite intense .'

S"pours with a brilliantly clear amber color that shows a rich brownish tinged ruby color when held up to the light . it is topped by frothy , almost creamy , light tan colored head . wow the aroma is quite rich with a malty sweetness that i was not expecting from a vienna . the aroma is so sweet it almost takes on a fruity note that is a bit like raisins , or even perhaps a hint of cherry . there is also a light spicy hop note here that accentuates the fruit character found in the nose . underneath the sweetness is a bit of dry toasted malt aromatics that are just noticeable . the taste is definitely sweet , though thankfully not nearly as much as the aroma might expect . there are fruity notes of raisins and again a hint of cherry . the hops have a nice , though subtle , contribution here that is lightly spicy , every so slightly herbal and a nice balancing bitterness in the finish . as the beer warms up the sweetness picks up a bit , at times it becomes a bit too much . most of the time it is held in check by the hopping levels and the under-current of dry maltiness ; like notes of biscuits and lightly toasted malt . this beer certainly blows most examples of the style out of the water , but i ca n't help but think that this would be that much better if it had not finished a little bit drier ; it would be a bit more in balance and all that much more quaffable ."

S"a : light brown ; mildly cloudy ; thick white head with good retention -- even after 5 minutes there is a billowing head ; lacing is great s : mild citrus hoppiness ; grainy ; tea leaves and lemon linger ; fairly subtle aromas overall t : pleasant bitterness ; lemon and tea leaf flavors backed by a strong malt base make this a very refreshing and delicious beer for a hot , humid day ; a bit watery -- probably from the mildness of the beer but for what this is , it 's right on f : see above about the thinness but all in all the mouth coat is good d : incredibly drinkable ; one of the most sessionable , every day beers i have ever had"

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard american pint glass ... a : lovely bright golden colour with a surprisingly substantial head . s : citrusy , a bit of lime , a little of the biscuit-like malts i normally associate with fat tire , floral hops . t : the citrus comes through for me immediately , very refreshing , with the malts following soon after . mf/d : `` standard '' light bodied feel to it , with decent carbonation . but hugely drinkable - definitely one for a hot summer 's day . when drinking skinny dip , it 's important to remember it 's a `` lite '' beer , aimed at the summer season , so i think it 's unfair to taste this beer expecting big flavour . from a beer with just 4.2 % abv , i feel it 's a well put together drink . i do enjoy more body to my brew , but when you 're on the beach , hanging out at a backyard bbq , or out mowing the yard in the haze of july , this is an excellent companion to have ."

S"maximus comes in the 650ml brown bottle , with another one of their relatively nondescript labels , with large black and green lettering . the give-you're-head-a-shake stories on the sides of the bottle are always diverting though ( and they make more sense after a couple bottles ) . if it were not for them , the lagunitas labels would be extremely boring . maximus pours very agreeably , forming a rich bed of beige-yellowish foam . the underlying bubbles are a little larger , but the consistency of the foam viewed from the top is compact and ice-cream like . thin lacing , but it clung well and formed paint-like splotches . the beer is dark rust in colouration ; equal parts orange and red . lighter than an amber , but darker than most pale ales . at first the liquid appears quite limpid , but there is a very fine haziness upon closer examination , and as you pour the last bit you can see the sediment clearly floating in the beer . delightful looking brew . the first sniff after pouring the beer is quite malty , but as the head lessens and the beer breathes a little , the expected dark-wood spicy hops assert themselves . the beer is quite balanced to me though : instead of the hops being dominant in the aroma , the malting holds its own against them , as evidenced by the inescapable sugary sweetness throughout . i will say that the hops do increase in magnitude the more the beer sits and aerates . the aroma is a little similar to brown shugga ' . other aromas include some milkiness , maple syrup , pepper , tree bark , and a great woodiness from the hopping . raisins , definite dried prunes , figs , and a faint hit of vodka-like alcohol lurking underneath . plenty of complexity to be had . the west-coast hops add all sorts of earthy vinous notes : spice-filled and warming . sometimes cinnamon-like , sometimes seasoning salt in nature . as expected , the hops really do define the taste of maximus . the aroma does not suggest the astringent dryness of the taste . the malt is just as present as the hops in the smell , but the taste changes all that : on the tip of the tongue , save a small bit of white-sugar sweetness , the woody hops start to add their bitterness . by the middle the cinnamon and grapefruit and lemon are all there , and the finish is dizzyingly dry , at first . the finish is all about mouth-puckering . after sipping , though , the dryness lessens . the taste is not as filled with nuances as the aroma , but still very tasty and full of flavours like burnt toast , mollasses , pomegranate seeds , honeycomb , toffee , ground coffee , and a strong metallic presence , like copper ."

S'reviewed from notes sampled on 12-1-07 pours a very deep red/brown color , with a very thin head and clingy lacing . smell is all bourbon , with a huge vanilla character and a nice woodiness . outstanding . taste is just like the smell , only more intense . lots of bourbon , with a smooth , tart alcohol to accompany it . maybe a little hop bitterness on the finish . mouthfeel is very good , ultra smooth with just the perfect amount of carbonation . drinkability suffers from the big bourbon flavors , but is still pretty good .'

S"thanks to kkulacki for 12oz bottle ! color on pouring into a pint glass is dark , but with tones of brown as well , so it 's not totally black . the head is cream-colored and with a fantastic amount of lacing . taking a whiff of this thing , you can start to smell the coffee ... and some alcohol from a few inches away . closer sniff is all coffee/espresso and roast . on to the taste . the first hit is all coffee . very strong coffee ... then as it moves to the back of the palate , more of the bitter chocolate tones come through . there 's definitely a taste of alcohol and it 's very bitter on the finish , but not overwhelming . as far as drinkability , i 'd probably only have one or two - it 's definitely good , but a strong one and quite bitter and heavy ."

S'a-pours a translucent golden color with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly . s-some biscuity malts , a hint of hops , and a hint of lemon zest . not much on the nose . t-perfect balance between the malts and hops , as neither dominates the flavor profile . there is some light hoppiness and some biscuity malt . there is also a hint of lemon in the flavor . according to the brooklyn brewery website there are four hops used , but it is not hoppy at all . it has a very crisp and clean finish . m-about perfect i think , even though its a little watery , its meant to be an easy drinking beer . d-through the roof . definitely sessionable as it is only 5 % alcohol and very , very easy to drink . its also very tasty and enjoyable . i highly recommend this for summer consumption .'

S"750 ml corked and caged bottle , # 1540 best before 05/12/09 . cork comes out easily with just a twist of the fingers . exceedingly pale yellow colored beer with a tall puffy white head . there is a reason these things are called white beers . the scent is bready and extremely spicy and floral . very strong coriander aroma along with strong orange and black pepper aroma . quite the floral scented beer this is comparable to deus or hennepin in this respect . could score a little higher but it is n't as intense as american versions and it does n't quite have the complexity of something like st. bernardus wit . the taste begins sweet and a little malty with a slight carbonation caused metallic sourness in the finish . decent wheat and spice flavor but this is a bit light on the flavor . definite over carbonated bite to this beer more noticeable due to the lightness . mouthfeel is seltzer water and heavy on the carbonation . a light white beer ? this is certainly easy to drink and is very light in the mouth . one glass of this disappears very quickly and i certainly have plans to finish the whole bottle myself . at this alcohol level this is an excellent beer to go with light foods like salad or mild flavored fish . if this was in 12 oz bottles this could be the definitive lawnmower beer . this is a beer that specializes in being drinkable and in this it excels . $ 6.99 at the san luis obispo bevmo ."

S'2005 vintage . tap sample from the freakin frog . brown in colour with hints of amber . low carbonation . powerful sweet malt aroma with a nice light hoppy citrus fruit ( although not cascade or centennial , from what i could tell ) overlay . more of the same in the mouth with a bit of an alcohol presence , but what surprised me was the lighter than expected body of this beer . the solid bitterness that kept everything in check too . a very drinkable beer for its size . well done stone !'

S'apparently , someone likes this beer , but i can not count myself among the crowd . this was one of the strangest and least appealing beers i have ever had . pours hazy cloudy black with an enormous purplish head . the smell is slight and roasted . but , oh , the flavor - the flavor is overwhelmingly sour cherry , it simply blasts everything else away . the mouthfeel is fairly smooth , but that intense , overwhelming cherry flavor makes this beer nearly undrinkable'

S"12oz bottle at the addison flying saucer into a snifter . a : pours an amber color with a big off-white head that fades to a ring and leaves a lot of sticky lacing on the glass . s : the aroma was all hops in the form of grapefruit and pine . pretty one dimensional but excellent as far as imperial reds go . t : the taste was huge on the hops as well with a grapefruit flavor that lasted until the piney hops took over and lasted for a long time . the finish was extremely bitter and really let you know there was a lot of hops in this thing . m : the feel was nice and creamy with a good amount of carbonation ... about medium bodied . d : i could n't drink more than one of these without having something to eat due to the bitterness left on the palate . the abv really kicks your butt too but that goes without saying in a 9 % beer . glad i got to try it but i would n't want to drink more than 1 in a sitting . not sure i would buy a 4pack from the store either . worth a try if you like the leviathan series though ."

S"i had this a handful of years ago when i did n't know better . been falling for belgians each opportunity that comes my way . a cute little bottle , with an asiatic label twist . now onto the chimay grande reserve ( blue / blauw ) . body is a meaty amber peat . carbonation is not noticeable . head is frothy , that opens big pancake holes , like before you realize the bottom 's burnt . head remains pretty true to size , lacing is sparse but cascades nice after you swish . caps over a long period with intermittent ring . emitting is the heavy alcohol , coffee , some toffee malts , floral , nutty and definite banana ! first to the tongue ignites the dryness of alcohol and some sweet . mid is interupted constantly by the alcohol . the 9 % ( next time i 'll look at the label ) is not blanketed and is annoying . the composition is fabulous , and is discarded by the abv % . a shame , moreso a tragedy . the back finish is very dry and stays with you like too much rum in your eggnog at family christmas . food partner came easy though . with the cayenne / beer crumb battered fried oysters , side them with a garlic-horseradish-mayo . mmmm"

S"a - translucent caramel amber , mediocre head with low retention s - lemon peel , lots of pine , white grape juice t - the bitterness plays out really interestingly . there 's a big hop kick on the first sip that keeps you on the edge of your seat , waiting for a wallop of bitterness , but it does n't hit you right away . it makes you double check the 95 ibu label on the bottle . the bitterness is incredibly delayed , and shows up deep into the aftertaste . that said , it overlaps and builds between sips . it 's a little overpowering after a while as you realize they did n't miss a decimal place on the ibus . the flavor profile includes pine , spice , pepper , and campari . m - nice body , very smooth . the bitterness really lingers . d - i split a 12oz bottle with a friend , and we both had our fill after drinking our half . o - a niche beer that 's more of a bitter novelty than a session beer ."

S"picked up at the wf bowery for $ 1.99 a single . poured from a neat little 12 oz can , hilarious can design ! went into a pub glass . presentation off the pour is stellar . bif frothy 2 '' foam filled head , slow to recede . leaving ample thick lace . color is terrific , a nice hazy unfiltered look , new copper color with mild amber reddish hues . a solid cap with even thicker collar is left behind in retention . like i said , terriffic appearance on this . aroma is almost non-existent , mild caramel sweetness , some mild hop aroma and a touch of minerally water . but its very subdued and hard to detect without a swirl of the glass to force aroma to come through . in which case i did , but then lost all my beautiful lace . : ( taste isnt bad really , sweet bready malted goodness mixing with plenty of caramel sweetness and a mild sweet cream butter flavor . hops come through at the swallow , although still mild as well . bittering into the finish with a mild linger of pine and earthy hop spice . mouthfeel is full bodied with a touch of carbonation zing . for an apa the aroma is pretty mild , presentation is great and flavors are by the book . its no award winning apa , but its a sessionable beer that is also very easy drinking . decent example of the style . i enjoyed a 6 pack over a night in the hotel of this . definatly kept me satisfied ."

S"chilled bottle into a glass . purchased from the brewery , so i assume it 's fresh . date your shit , moylan 's ! a : pours a reddish copper body with a finger of short-lived , light beige head . it is incredibly sticky , depositing waves upon waves of nice lace down the sides of the glass . well , that 's a good sign that it 's going to be a hoppy beer . s : and the nose confirms it ! grapefruit , pineapple , orange rind . it 's not a 'clean ' citrus aroma ; it is decorated with an herbal , pine-like scent , as well as substantial caramel , perhaps even toffee . t : i had this mainly because my recent experience with hill farmstead 's ephraim reminded me of this beer . i wanted to have it again to verify my impressions . i see the similarities ; hopsickle has quite a delicious citrus character of grapefruit , pineapple , passionfruit , orange rind . it is also substantially bitter . at the same time , it tries to cover that up with an unsubtle blast of caramel and nuts ( reminding me of peanut brittle ) . i 'd give the nod to ephraim . m : heavy , and a bit hot . it has ample carbonation , but the bitterness is enamel-peeling , and the sugars contribute a mild burn in the finish . right now i just happen to be in the mood for that sort of thing , though i feel other beers do it better . d : i go literally years between having this beer . it 's good , but it 's overpriced , iffy on freshness ( due to lack of dates ) , and in the dipa spectrum , not particularly special . not a bad beer , but nothing to write home about , either ."

S'surprised to see this retired . i just bought a bottle in rochester 1 month ago . the beer pours a clear amber color with fluffy eggshell white head of 3 cm foaming up easily and fading slowly . aroma is mild pine sap and some caramel mixing almost indeterminably . sweet and sticky nose , if scents can have a texture . first sip reveals an average body with very fine and gentle carbonation . slight syrupy texture and a fine sticky coating on lips after each sip . flavor is caramel and toffee then rolling to pine sap and bitey hops that linger long after each swallow . some grapefruit hits the sides of my tongue as well . the abv is hidden pretty well and the beer is dangerously easy to drink considering the 8.4 % . i like this beer and find it to be a nice drinkin beer .'

S"a- looks like a pretty standard macro lager ... coloring is yellowish dry grass and of course is very clear . the head is cloud white in color , starts out very nice looking , but fizzles out quickly to a half-assed layer on top . carbonation looks to be about right , with lots ! lacing is modest but there is some hanging onto the side of my glass , slowly sliding back into the beer . s- not much to report here ... .smells similar to canadian , but a little better . adjuncty cereal grains and maybe just a little hint of hop bitterness but underwhelming overall ... not because it smells bad , but because molson forgot to include any aroma of note . t- tastes much like it smells ... .very bland . some boiled corn sweetness , maybe some rice grits to keep it clean tasting and some slightly metallic type finish ... .not offensive but it 's vague and underwhelming . there 's a sweet tasting flavor that lingers on the palate for awhile after the swallow ... reminds me of the aftertaste of a sweet bread minutes after eating it . m- i have to say that the body is a little better than watery thin , and with plenty of `` micro-carbonation '' to scrub the palate clean and keep this one crisp and refreshing ... so i gave this area a little better than average for the rating . d- i 'm not really a fan of molson branded product , and this one does n't really scream 'different ' ... i agree with a previous review and think the different molson varieties come from the same tank . this really seems like a canadian clone ... .perhaps just a smidge better b/c the bad flavors are hidden better by the massive co2 . i guess i could drink this if my options are limited but would pass otherwise ."

S"pours a murky red-tinged very dark brown . almost black in parts , but not quite . like eminem it only wishes it were black . head is an odd yellow colour , almost turmeric , and dissipates to leaves a bit of a rim . lace is something else , thick and clingy . an interesting stout . nose makes me think it 's a weizenbock , because there 's lots of fresh-cut banana on that , full banana esters coming at me . some slight hints of espresso behind it , some caramel notes and a hint or two of some clove and mild cardamom . but the banana is dominant , which spoils an otherwise decently complex nose ( not the banana itself spoiling it , just the fact that the banana is so dominant ) . taste is strong , from the get-go . a fair amount of fruitiness , with more banana and a hint of dried mango at the front . descends quickly into a robust roasted dark beer character , with lots of bittersweet chocolate , tobacco character and a hint of mint and coriander on the mid . finish has a distinct alcohol kick ; try as you might , 18 % can not be hidden , plus a slight sour edge with peppery notes . never quite loses sight of that banana pulp , which re-emerges as a very interesting twist at the end . there 's a lot of complexity on there but somehow i feel the flavour is subjugated by the strong booziness . quite a fascinating beer but am not entirely sold on this . mouthfeel feels quick slick for what it is but it 's mostly heavy , the very evident alcohol dries up the finish . certainly to style but not the easiest drinking texture . am interested enough to keep sipping but it 's not exactly a quaffer , let 's face it ."

S"poured some into a pint glass , drank the rest from a 32oz bottle . appearance/smell - appears pale yellow with a touch of copper . not to much head at all , no lacing , and has high carbonation . smells very heavily of metal , alcohol , corn & rice , and a dash of malt ( adjuncts ) that 's about all i could detect . taste/mouthfeel - tastes like semi sweet corn , rice and a dash of alcohol with metallic flavors . it 's a bit watered down and dry at the same time . as it warms , metallic/alcoholic flavors begin to dominate . all the carbonation fills you up pretty fast too . mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body . drinkability/final thoughts - you could probably only drink a few of these before the 5.5 % sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face . not much to say about this beer . nothing to foul or offensive about it , which is good , and for 1.50 a 32oz , plus 5.5 % abv . that makes it an easy to drink , kick back get a buzz beer . its a decent adjunct lager , but a little one profile and boring . id still say give it a try sometime when your low on cash ."

S"really fizzy , golden colored and clear body . not any head retention , but what i did see was off white , but totally vanished seconds after the pour . aroma wise it 's pretty husky and grainy , along with a slight fruitiness . it actually reminds me a lot of a koelsch style beer . the taste shares the traits of the aroma , except for a honey like flavor in the end . this brew is crisp , light , and refreshing . not a bad summer bbq beer . overall this beer is n't bad . if you would have told me this was a koelsch , i would have believed it ."

S"07/16/05- purcahsed at plumpjack 's in san francisco , ca presentation- poured into my duvel tulip . 11.2oz bottle with a best before may , 2005 date . appearance- golden-orange colored pour with a fat creamy white head and excellent lacing . smell- not skunky , but not a good smell . smells like rotted veggies or maybe even rotted meat . taste- taste is even worse than the smell . bad bottle ? i 've had skunked bottles , and this is not skunked . it 's something else . almost as if you have left out meat on the couter or something . kinda rancid . ca n't even find malt or hops through the offensive taste . mouthfeel- hard to rate mouthfeel highly when you dislike the beer . it was creamy and smooth with a medium carbonation level . drinkability- drain pour just as the beer before . bad streak going here ."

S'pours golden yellow with a creamy head that seems to last and good lacing . i had this from a wine glass with the beer at cellar temp aroma of sour green apple , piney , citrusy hops with light spices , ginger , pine needles not a whole lot of balance in the flavour , this beer shows off the hops . citrus ripe grapefruit and lemon rind with no real solid malt backbone for any depth of flavour . hard to ignore how light bodied this beer is . really quite watery'

S"poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a goblet , very little head appeared . minimal lacing as well . it 's a very , very deep brown-almost black in some places . odors of caramel , dough , and raisin blended with bourbon make for one very complex-smelling ale . the initial taste , with obvious tones of raisin , caramel and nuts , is something of a bourbon/wine hybrid . the high abv is noticeable but not overwhelming . raison d'extra has a very pleasant finish-the creaminess and fruity flavor lingers for some time ."

S"anheuser-busch 's answer to blue moon . the problem with reviewing this beer is that i found myself constantly comparing it to bm , because they are so close in nature . however , this beer presently surprised me . it has a nice touch of sweetness , but not too much - which makes it well balanced . maybe a hint of bitterness would make it an even better choice , but then again , it is a anheuser-busch brew . the color is very nice - a pale orange that reminds you of the summer months . it smells exactly like a blue moon , but it has a distinct difference in taste . overall , like some others have said , if i had the choice between the usual american brews at a bar/restaurant and this one , and no other micro-brews were available , this would be my choice ."

S"pours a crystal clear golden brass hue , with a dense and creamy snow white head reaching three fingers and holding well . decent specs of lacing remain on the sides of the glass . light caramel and faint buscuit notes in the nose , but no hop aroma to speak of ! ! ! i understand this beer is dry-hopped with two of my favorite varietals- but the only background aroma i can detect is a vauguely tropical fruit scent that may well be an ester . slightly grainy two row sweetness at first sip ; mild but agreeable . pale caramel and faint dextrin round out the malt profile and dry the palate quickly . the aftertaste has a hint of apple ester and some ghost-like citric hop flavor if you really pay attention . the bitterness is far too light to balance , even for the english version of ipa and i have a hard time beliveing this has 60 ibu 's . light in body with an medium-even carbonation , the mouthfeel is airy and dry enough to dispell any chance of residual sugars . some extra mild minty and floral hop tones finally develop in the finish , but are too tame to be noteworthy behind the malt , and even that is on the lighter side of the spectrum . i guess jw dundee has suceeded in making a beer for people who do n't care for bitterness or hop character of any sort that they can call an ipa and try to feel trendy or sophisticated ."

S"i just came in from working and i am hot and thirsty . i think this 750 will do the trick . poured into a chimay goblet it is keeping a consistant inch thick head with this constant flow of bubbles up from the bottom of the glass . yellow straw-no- a little darker but not quite amber . dark straw light amber . nose is thick with all the ususal suspects . big tripel nose with apple bannana esters a grainy bready kind of middle and hoppy snap with some light vanilla at the end . typical triple taste is following well in the footsteps of the nose . i am a much bigger fan of the doubles and quads and the darker more malt front belgians but this one is touching me . its very soft and gentle . its drawing me in . good lacing as expected . a second pour brings the head right back up and that unending collumn of bubbles continues . i guess the chimay glass was a good choice as this beer seems to perform very well in it . the picture on the bottle is very cool with the monks- i guess-out in the field harvesting the grain by hand and the sod or straw roofed houses in the background . as the beer warms more apple sweetness is coming through but it still holds a full triple flavor with a nice mellow hops ending . the third and final pour has the head standing at attention again and the collumn never wavers except back and forth a bit . its room temp now and seems even more mellow or maybe its just me at the end of a 750 of 8 % tripel . the last sips have a chinamon clove apple bread like a sweet apple cake/pie kinda flavor . an all around good beer . this one suprised me . i could drink this all day . i think i 'll have another right now ."

S'22oz bottle ( bottled on 7/13/10 ) received in a great trade with jpmclaug . big thanks for this one ! poured into a bruery tulip . a - pours an extra pale straw yellow color with pretty good clarity ... just a hint of haze . a thick pillow of creamy , dense white foam forms on top and hangs around for a long time . thick sheets of lacing left on the glass . s - grainy and wheaty up front with lots of grassy hops . big whiff of hay and a very light lemony citrus aroma . very nice . t - grainy at the base with lots of crisp grassy hops . very clean , almost too clean ... makes me think more of a fine german pils instead of a kolsch . there is just the slightest touch of citrusy lemon in here which sets apart from the pils profile . m - crisp and sharp bitterness with a long lingering aspect to it . the soft malt sweetness that sits at the base is really the starting point to this beer . very subtle sweetness that plays into the lemony aspects of the beer . so clean tasting and refreshing . carbonation level is on the high side and causes the flavors to fill the mouth completely riding on prickly waves of bubbles . d - very drinkable beer . i could see myself sitting on my deck all day and not moving ... maybe i should have saved this for the holiday weekend . low alcohol at 4.8 % makes this extra good . a true session beer with tons and tons of flavor . this should satisfy any craft beer drinker ... outstanding .'

S'bottle poured into a tasting glass . thanks to kevin for sharing this one ! ( a ) - pours thick and pitch black as motor oil . some dark transparent bubbles popped up , but otherwise a serious thickness to this one . ( s ) - super rich . some molasses and boozy heat . some deep chocolate aspects coming through as well . ( t ) - so rich and sweet . tons of caramel , molasses , and layers of dark chocolate with an underlying warmth . ( m ) - slick and rich/decadent . very sweet , but decent abv integration . lower carbonation level , but not bothersome . ( d ) - this is a different monster , but a good one . it would be a chore to tackle a bottle with only 1 or 2 people however . it is a tad over-the-top , but sometimes that fits my mood and this was kind of a welcomed transition for the evening from sours . i would be curious what age did to this .'

S"i originally had this on tap a few weeks ago at the happy gnome . unfortunately it was about my 6th pint of the night so all i remember was that i really liked it . i was lucky enough to run across some cans at cellars in eagan , so now i can review this gem . this beer pours a fabulous crystal clear orange color into my imperial pint glass . it fits just perfectly in the glass w/ a glistening white head riding just above the bulged out portion of the glass . it is oh , so inviting . the aromas are prominent w/ a pleasant hoppy nose . citrusy aromas and even some earthiness come about from the glass . you can defintely appreciate the dry hoppage . the flavor is fantastic w/ a soft hoppy bite initially followed by some toasty , mildy sweet malts . the beer finishes w/ a citrus tang . it is n't really overly bitter , which is quite nice and true to the style . i do get a faint `` grassiness '' at the end which is n't entirely enjoyable . this is not however a major flaw . the mouthfeel is light , crisp and clean . stellar is one word to describe this beer . i 'm a sap for good english beers . this definitely is n't english , but it is a good americanized version of the english bitter . an obvious session beer . i wish surly would release this year round . it is a great beer to have around when you finish a long day at work , mow the lawn on a hot day , or are just feeling like having a good , drinkable brew . if only i could find this on cask somewhere ..."

S"22 oz bomber . fresh appearance : appears to be a nearly opaque black , but when held a light behind it was a deep red , beautiful . minimal head that faded rather quickly . not much lacing as a drank . smell : i could smell this bad-boy from five feet away . the aroma was dominated by upfront is dominated by a strange sweetness , and then a strong alcohol presence . taste : up front it tastes just like it smells . there is a malt sweetness and booziness and i did not really enjoy , but then as the beer is swallowed and processed by my brain i picked up nice coffee and especially chocolate notes , that helped achieved a balance that would have been welcome earlier on . alcohol certainly noticeable , maybe a little overwhelming . mouthfeel : i was surprised to find that this beer felt quite light in my mouth , almost watery , considering the style and alcohol . did not leave much on the palate except maybe a slight watery sweetness . drinkability : as a 10 % baltic porter served fresh out of a bomber this perfect to split among a couple friends . not particularly drinkable , as the alcohol is quite present , and not all the flavors really worked together for me not a style i am all that familiar with , as it does not seem as though many breweries make baltic porter 's but i was expecting a little more out this"

S'a golden yellow sight , virtually no head but there is the thinnest light head on the side . take a whiff of this fella and you get red pepper flakes and habenero ... stings the nostrils . wet peppery habenero bite that gets you in the throat upon swallowing this beer . there is some metallic taste before and after the spice of this drink . i would rate it about a 6 on the spicy scale . the hit of this beer is a lot like a jalapeno popper or a teaspoon full of red pepper flakes . this would pair perfect with some nachos , but not much else .'

S"a : a little darker than i would think . darker than straw yellow . the head was huge . i filled less than half the glass with the beer and the head was over-flowing . a head lasted the whole time and left distinct rings of lacing around the glass . t : the hops come out strong . i did n't find it to be balanced with the malt . the malt sweetness just came out a bit in the aftertaste . perhaps being an american pale ale , it should be imbalanced this way , unlike an english pale ale . m : medium . d : it 's not my type of beer being that the dominant flavor is from the hops . for me , it 's not very drinkable , but to others it may be . the imbalance and lack of discernible complexity are hits to drinkability for me ."

S"scored an 05-06 sixer last week along with some 06-07 . gon na review both and compare/contrast the two . 05-06 release : pours a thick , used motor oil , midnight black with a ridiculous , frothy , caramel brown head that retains fairly well . aroma is of sweet milk chocolate , sweet roasted dark malts . smells like malty hershey 's chocolate syrup . like desert in my glass . not much alcohol is detected in the nose as i remember it when this first came out last year . taste has mellowed out a lot , already . still a mild alcohol warmth present but when these babies were fresh last year , i remember them being very harsh . extremely chocolatey , very sweet , coffee flavors all over the place as well , caramel , toffee , cherries . very dry and incredibly roasty finish that stays in your mouth for a long long time . extremely tasty and would serve as a tremendous apertif beer . mouthfeel is extremely rich and heavy . thick like mud soup or my '92 toyota tercel 's engine oil right about now after it has n't been changed for about 6,000 miles . just enough carbonation for this beer . this is a meal , and serves well as a desert . hence , it is n't ridiculously drinkable but it sure is damn tasty ."

S"poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a nonic pint . this beer pours a hazy straw color with about two fingers of white , fluffy head . retention is poor though , and lacing is about average . wheat and citrus dominate the smell . the taste follows the nose - wheat and lemons are basically what 's going on here . there 's just a touch of noble hops and sweet malts to round it out . it 's just a good tasting beer , nothing outstanding , but nothing to turn down either . the mouthfeel is about right , just a hair too carbonated for my taste . it 's incredibly drinakble though . this is a pretty good beer , i think i 'd enjoy it more on a hot day than in the cold of winter here . worth trying , for sure ."

S"excellent example of a heavy stout . sweet malt , coffee and chocolate predominate with high alcohol level kept in check by a nice measure of hops . if i had to criticize i would say that the sweetness could be dialed back a bit , which would allow some of the more bitter flavors to come through . i 've rated drinkability at a lower level because it 's not one you are likely to pound back at a session , but as a single ( very hard to find 12 oz but nice to split ) its a sweetheart ."

S"had this nitro tap at bodega , review from notes . how do you make an already smooth beer more smooth ? by nitrogenating it ! at a bar where you typically do n't get served a glass with much ( if any ) head , my beer arrived with two solid fingers of thick head that would n't budge . quivering as one solid mass like pudding , the head had as good of retention as any beer ; move over guinness . i have heard of ( and tried ) resting a bottle cap on the head of a beer - i bet nitro milk stout could support a quarter ! tons of visible micro bubbles ring the inside of the glass for three fingers below the head . otherwise this is a black beer , the head is a dark mocha color . ohh , and the lace was awesome . you know the shape of canned cranberry sauce on a plate ? that 's the pattern the lace left on the inside of my glass . actually , as i begin recalling the lace i feel the need to bump the appearance score up to a 5 from my initial 4.5 . mild roasted malts and the unmistakable scent of a nitrogenated beer rise up at me . personally , i prefer the regular version on this acumen . tastes sweeter than its counterpart . lots of lactic sweetness lending an extremely smooth character to the beer . coffee bitterness and bitter dark malts spill onto my palate through the smooth filter of nitrogen . mouthfeel = smooth . 'nuff said . ohh , i gave it a 5 , need a little more ? it was like drinking in cloud vapor . drinkability is good enough , but i prefer the regular version of this beer to the nitrogenated version ."

S"i was ill-prepared for this beast . i had no idea i was coming face to face with such grotesque ( twisted ) fruit and floral flavors . difficult to pick a fruit exactly , it seemed like some chaotic combination of prunes , rosepetals , allspice/ginger/instant cider , peach/mango , some red and green jolly ranchers , robitussin , and cotton candy.. yeah , i 'm not standing by that as scientific but it 's somewhere in that arena in terms of sugary-floral-sickly-sweetness . this was an issue at first because prior to opening i was thinking bitterness , brandy , no . it should be noted that my sweettooth is pretty weak ... yeah , keep your rumplemints , gran marnier , and jaegar . the sweetness was so unexpected that at first my crutch to deal with it was some homemade jalapeno salsa which i 'd have intermittently through the first couple oz 's . that leveled it out quite well , and at the point i had waded in past my balls , i was able to drink it like a normal human . by the end , i had finally come to enjoy the bizarre and extreme concoction , both for its uniqueness and for the wallop it was giving my tongue , and its medicinal warming . i have a feeling that like many things , a beer of this stature is an acquired taste . it was remarkable how well-disguised the alcohol is , considering . now that i know what i 'm up against , i think i 'm ready for another bout with this one to get a better reading , and for nuking it , which i did n't know was possible . and yes that will then be a shot , which might even need a chaser . obviously drinkability is low for the average brute , unless you drink gran marnier shots with breakfast . everyone should buy this if they see it to reckon with it 's unique presentation when normal human beer seems boring , or to make drinking a 22 with a pal more akin to a sporting event of straight-face keeping ."

S'apparently this has been on-tap at a boston bar or two recently but my tasting was done from one of those large 3 litre bottles . my brother gave it to me as a graduation gift from law school this past spring and i have been sitting on it since . really want to taste this beer on-tap . poured a deep = , burnt red in color that was leaning just a bit toward brown . the head with every pour was huge . i was afraid it was going to be flat even though it had one of those rubber swing-top stoppers . sheet-like lacing all over the interior of the glass . nose had hints of dark fruit ( figs mostly ) with molasses and just a slight tang of hops . flavor is a very melllow complex . there is a whole lot going on but not too much of any one thing . the oak adds a dimension that really brings the flavor home and keeps everything subdued and enjoyable . more strong molasses andsome deep-woods piney hops give a nice sweet base with a just slightly bitter bite to it all . got some black cherry , fig and raisin flavors out of it also . full body that was extremely smooth and not-quite creamy . absolutely amazingly drinkable and enjoyable .'

S"nothing quite like a meal in a bottle . this one you must drink off tap as the bottle does n't have a widget . the appearance is deep dark black with a tan head that reduces to some lace . strong coffee smell , a bit bitter , and it tastes chocolaty and roasted with a bit of an after-taste . very thick and creamy feel . i would say one is all i can do on these , and i enjoy stouts . it 's quite filling ."

S'thanks to akorsak for bringing back and sharing a growler of yummy rbb brew ! a-deep , dark brownish amber with a medium off-white head that reduced to a thin cap and left decent lace . s-dry , spicy rye malt overlying a pan of fresh biscuit malt and a popping citrus hop zip . t-robust biscuit and lightly sweet caramel malt all getting down and hapy with a pleasant dose of spicy rye . juicy citrus hop zip adds nice balance to the malt base . m-medium bodied , sharp , dry and crisp . nice lingering rye spiciness and citrus hop bitterness . d-five percent with a ton of flavour -- - & gt ; what more could you ask for ? this is a fine session brew that delivers the goods !'

S"appearance : a nice copper color with a small very large bubbly head . the head does n't last long but it leaves a very sticky lace that looks beautiful . smell : roasted caramel , wood chips , molasses , alcohol all attack the nose . there really is no finess in this . it is what it is and it lets it all out at the aroma . taste : raisins , figs , burnt caramel . these are some of the great flavors i can taste in this . even though these are great they do not hide the alcohol very well . the alcohol makes itself too well know in this beer . mouthfeel is very sticky and rich , i liky . not very drinkable based on the alcohol basically ."

S"unibroue promised its fans would appreciate this beer . as a fan , i can attest that they deliver . pours a murky reddish brown with the ever so common giant unibroue head . the aromas were mostly dark fruits , with hints of banana , and some spices . the taste follows the aromas with raisins and banana bread . hints of caramel and maybe some toffee . bread-like flavors are present the entire time , and the finish is like biting into an orange . it 's a very complex brew , and with so many flavors , it could get overwhelming , but someone holds together . the feel was a bit aggressive , but crisp , leaving a slightly tart taste in your mouth . i could n't drink a ton of this , but sharing a bottle is nice ."

S"first off , this is one of my favorite breweries . no hype , just a pleasant place up the hudson river to stop for some fresh beer done right . i often stop by when i 'm in the area ... about 25 miles north of my place in manhattan . excellent ipa ... nice hops , but not too bitter . this is a well-balanced ipa through and through . i favor the english-style where the hops are present and pronounced , but not too over the top . i had one at the brewery and took a growler home sunday evening . now its thursday , and i am finishing off the growler ... better than ever . well done , defiant !"

S"this beer uses three different countries ' hops , from near the 48th latitude , which is the hop-belt of the northern hemisphere . killer ! pours a bronzed copper color , with a big fluffy head . just a big solid , gorgeous , beautiful-looking beer that beckons you to drink it . aroma is toffee/caramel against the herbal hop aroma , which also is a little big grassy , but not intensely so . there are interesting impressions of tea and bubblegum buried in the aroma , too . flavor is grassy bitterness , which is controlled and kept in check with more prominent citrus fruit and light pine needle . good toffee/caramel malt balance . a bright and balanced flavor . texturally this is gentle , gliding and not over-carbonated . creamy ; light-to-medium bodied . boston beer co./samuel adams do n't throw their hat in the ipa ring very much , but they really should , as this is great on every level . about as easy-drinking and well-rounded an ipa as i 've had in a long time . excellent ."

S"appearance : the beer pours with little head but displays some above average retention regardless of substance . there is some patchy lacing down the glass as you work through the brew . the color is a slightly dark copper with a fair amount of murky haze . smell : the alcohol presence here is a real nose burner . it is offset by some mild caramel sweetness and crisp citrus hop character but it 's hard to tame an 11+ percent abv beast like this . taste and mouthfeel : as i was drinking this cold i was finding it slightly caustic , simply too much alcohol presence but as the brew warmed i find the flavors to really develop . the warmer this gets the more the astringent alcohol burn fades to make way for a mild caramel sweetness , some citrus rind , and a fruit punch note in the fore . drink this one warm for sure . the mouthfeel is still predominantly bitter and stinging but as far as 11 % beers go this one is dangerously smooth and flavorful . i wish i had another bottle to cellar but alas i do n't . drinkability : it really is n't drinkable despite how impressive it is . i ca n't see myself drinking many of these especially considering that it comes in bombers . watch out , this beer will put you on your ass . bottom line : my last 11+ abv beer was weyerbacher eleven and when i had that i knew it was pretty bad but now i really know why . stone has done a really good job here where it seems many have failed ."

S"this tasting took place while i was perched like a happy gargoyle on a barstool at the venerable max 's taphouse in baltimore . it is amber colored with a shimmering head . within , one sees a few carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom . the glass remains consistently coated with a thin lacing . it looks like your average imperial pilsner . the nose gets a strong whiff of vanilla and almond that reminds me a little of bourbon . ( bourbon beer ! what a wild concept this could be ! ) the palate gets a rather malty greeting with a strange aftertaste that comes off as grassy . the biscuity mouthfeel overwhelms . as are most beers of this type , the rogue morimoto is not a sessional quaff , but a big bodied brew that demands respect , patience and , as always , the proper glassware . rogue does have its detractors ; however , i am not one ."

S"thanks to sacullen for the bottle from the nhl bif . a - very light head with tiny bubbles . pours a deep golden color . good bit of lace left with each glass tip despite the minimal head . s - herbal grassiness in the aroma . slight peppery spice . very pleasant aroma makes me anxious for that first sip . t - good . not outstanding . still grassy up front , leaving a slightly honey taste at the back of the mouth . very little after taste left at all . m - crisp and refreshing , with a slightly drying feel as it glides over your tongue . leaves a very dry mouth afterward , but in a positive way . d - the dryness in the mouthfeel definitely leaves me wanting more , and the great aroma makes me happy to keep bringing it back . the crispness makes this smooth and easy on this extremely hot summer night in los angeles . yes , this could be an everyday go-to beer for me , if it were readily available . and the lack of anything overwhelming at any stage of the game this makes this even more `` drinkable .

S"as the weather gets colder and colder , i find myself wanting dark heavy beers more and more . the brew poured a nice pitch black with a light head and sticky lace . smells of dark fruits , bourbon , caramel and molasses . the mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and medium bodied . taste is pretty much on par with the smells that came to mind , especially the molasses and fruit , which seem to compliment one another . there is also something dusty about this beer which reminds me of powdered sugar atop a rich dessert . as for drinkability , as much as i love all of the complexities amuck in this beer , i dont think i could drink more then one or two of these . the last beer i tried of the 100 barrel series by harpoon was the framboise , which i was n't overly impressed by . this on the other hand is a well made beer that is a great example of the russian imperial stout style . i highly recomend this brew and kudos to harpoon for making such an interesting offering ."

S"golden color beer with a bright white head that shows very good retention . a touch of hops and malt in the aroma serve as a precursor to the light , balanced flavor of this brew . although a bit more hoppy than malty , it is well balanced and light in flavor . they call it their `` flagship brew '' , but that must be based upon sales volume , as this is a non-spectacular beer . decent bitterness on the finish coupled with a light body and low abv make this a great session beer that will appeal to the masses ."

S'another quality brew available at liberty street brewing company . i recently bought a growler of it after drinking it at the bar . everything about this beer is pumpking pie and spice . the smell is sugary sweet , bringing pumpkin pie immediately to mind . a hint of roasted malt is also detectable in the background . pours with a good 2 finger head , tan in color . the beer itself is dark amber brown with decent clarity . you would expect to see a chunk of pumpkin pie floating around inside but alas , there is none . the flavor is great . cinnamon and sweet malts hit your right away . very smooth and low carbonation . most enjoyable cool but not necessarily cold . this is not a session beer , as the sweetness and pumpkin flavor may overpower you eventually , but it is a great sipper . awesome when paired with holiday meats like ham and turkey . very good beer for a seasonal treat and delivers on its name in spades .'

S'poured from a bottle into a pint glass . it pours a nice dark brown and forms an 1/8 inch mocha colored head that quickly reduces to a light lacing . almost opaque when held to the light with a ruby tinge around the edges . the aroma is coming out as it warms including solid caramel malt sweetness with some roasted nut and coffee hints . the taste is solid as well with a primarily roasted malt flavor and some mild hoppy back notes with some almost wheat-like spots . the mouthfeel is light bodied with a pleasant and balances level of carbonation which may take away slightly from the taste but improves drinkability . it goes down crisp with a very mild coffee-like dryness at the end . overall , this beer is very drinkable . it is like a combination of light and dark beers with reasonable components of each making it pleasant , refreshing and worth a trial if you can get it .'

S"pours like 15-year-old used motor oil ! black ! little head once poured in the glass , which is dark brown in itself . whoa was it thick ! my tastemates all said it looked mean ! ( ended up tasting mean , too ! ) it burned on the lips , and kicked my ass ! do i shoot it or sip it ? ? ? the tastes are there ... chocolate , caramel , coffee , even notes of cinnamon . the history is quite clear ... the barrels keep the taste very potent but not overbearing . the first beer to warm my chest like my whiskey , it was awesome going down ! an outstanding beer , i was extremely excited to be able to say i 've tasted it . as it warms in the glass , the bite grows stronger . maybe this brew would be better appreciated by some experienced brewmasters , i thought it was a good beer but i ca n't justify rating it an a+ or 5 , because i would n't buy a bottle again . good , heavy content . like my trip to the grand canyon , it 's cool at first , but in the end , it 's just another attraction based on hype that i do n't fully understand . i rate my beer based on whether or not i 'd drink or buy again , and i simply would n't do neither on this one . the two beers that ultimately create this beast are exquisite , but this monster was n't for me ."

S'11.2 oz . bottle , 2009 edition , a : pours a relatively clear russet brown with a fizzy light head , poor retention . s : dark wheat , malt , cloves , light ethanol , fragrant . t : robust , full malt flavour with notes of cloves and light bananas . dark raisins and oloroso sherry hints as well . take aventinus and make it bigger , like a fortified aventinus which this is basically a de facto version of . ethanol is present but melds seamlessly with the other flavours . m : full-bodied , moderately viscous , warming ethanol finish . d : a contemplative effort for sipping , the flavour is very good and well worth the price for fans of aventinus .'

S"here 's a little story about celebration ale . one day , i was driving down a street just a few blocks from my home in san diego . i was following a white toyota celica being driven by a woman who appeared to be around 65 years of age . she slowed , turned on her turn signal , and used her remote to open her garage door . as i slowed behind her , i looked into her garage and was surprised to see an entire wall of the garage stacked with box after box of celebration - probably 15-20 cases of it . since then , i 've wondered if it was really good enough to warrant stocking up to that level for your family . pouring this into a standard pint glass reveals a fairly standard ipa - red-amber , with rising bubbles and a rocky , fluffy eggshell head . this is a bit more hazy than a standard ipa , however , a slight cloudiness that could just be chill haze . the head leaves an amazing lacing across the entire glass , from top to bottom , that i ca n't help but wonder is caused by an extremely clean glass or a slightly dirty glass . it is a wall of thick , bubbly lace that looks like styrofoam . smell - slight spruce-tip winter-ale spiciness in the beginning , and it 's all hop from there . this is one hoppy winter bomb , floral and citrusy . the taste echoes the flavor rather well - it begins with a caramelly malt that continues to a sprucey , spicy winter warmer flavor , and is almost immediately overwhelmed by sweet , sweet oily hops . yum yum . citrusy and oily , the hops are well balanced . smooth mouthfeel , very slight carbonation , oily hop finish , nearly clean at the end after swallowing . pretty good . definitely drinkable . hell , i had four in a row ."

S"pours a deep black . not the darkest imperial stout i 've seen . minimal head on a aggressive pour . smells of dark roasted malt and coffee , fairly sweet overall . there is a noticeable alcohol flavor early on with some chocolate and coffee flavors . sweeter chocolate malt flavors finish the flavor nicely . i was looking for the mouthfeel to be a little fuller , but its not too bad . a nice amount of carbonation that makes the beer go down smooth . fairly drinkable , but there is fairly noticeable alcohol flavors that detract from it ."

S"so , in my never ending quest to find leffe brunne in detroit , mi . i found a guy who `` ordered '' it for me . turns out , in the order , he mistaken leffe blonde for leffe brunne . now i had never had the blonde , but the guy offered it to me for free , as an apology for me driving out there for the brunne , which was n't there . so i unwrap the gold aluminum over the cap , grab my bottle opener , crack it open , and let it settle for a moment . take a nice swig , and it was love at first site . the beer went down smooth , with an aftertaste that only craves for more . the 6-pack was $ 9.99+dep , so not that pricey , but still a little expensive compared to some of the microbrews around here *great lakes , bells , etc . * in the end , i wound up drinking 3 before telling myself i needed to enjoy it again another day . a great buy , and a great reccomendation for anyone looking for a flavourful beer . delicious to the end ."

S"poured from a 12oz into my eastern sierra lager pint glass , head is an off white tan coloring , about a finger on a standard pour dissipates quite fast and leaves lacing which retains itself well . body is the color of caramel were it clear , looks more brown ale than amber ale to me , speaks for a malty brew i think . the scent is pretty standard to be honest , woody hops and toffee combined with some sweet maple syrup mostly . very mellow and refreshing on the nostrils although it does have the american lager smell reminiscent as well . the flavor profile is definitely standard amber ale leaning heavily on the malt for taste , spicing imparts a small contribution , curiously i do n't pick up much cinnamon i get more nutmeg and italian herbs ( would go well with pasta i think ) . the malt gives it a sweeter more earthy toffee taste although its very subtle you can barely tell it 's there . the mouthfeel is the american lager with an added spiciness to it that keeps the palate refreshed and ready for the next sip . definitely a sessionable brew with more flavoring than the standard macro-brew , i guess the overall grade is basically that it 's o.k . and for about $ 7/6er it 's not a bad deal ."

S"just got back home from the pty event at tria this afternoon , was one of the lucky ones who got in before the keg kicked . review based on my notes . a- i was expecting red , but this was a nondistinct gold . the head was fairly impressive , a finger of very creamy white that hung out for a long a time , and when it was finally tamed , still left some pretty lacing . s- unmistakably hoppy . this was the first hint at the greatness of pty . it was all citrus from the hops , with a subtle malty balance that kept it from going full on bitter . impressive . t- and this is where pty becomes significant . just the kind of citrusy , hoppy , well balanced flavor that the smell and the hype made me expect , but there was something else going on here that i had never detected before . maybe it was umami , the fifth taste , maybe it was the hop concentration taking the flavor to a whole other level , but the middle of this beer 's flavor was one of the most unique beer tastes i 've ever had . hard to put the finger on it , but in a blind taste test , i 'll never have a problem picking this one out of a lineup . bangin ' . m- as creamy as it looked , but with a light character , and a really sweet tingle on the tongue . awesome . d- there was a one per customer limit in effect ( though i cheated with my wife 's beer when she was in the bathroom ) - wish i could have gone back for a second . could i drink this all day ? i think it would ruin my appreciation of just about every other beer . the rarity is definitely part of the equation here . so did it live up to the hype ? yes , i think so . it was transcendental as far as beer goes , but it did not necessarily transcend beer . but who can really ask for anything more than that ? maybe i 'll have it again next year , but in the meantime , i ca n't say that nugget nectar is much of a drop off ."

S"this one is being based on a vertical of 04/05/06 , with a bit of a leaning towards the freshest on the overall ratings a : [ 2006 ] ruby pour , a moderate , light tan/pale orange tinted head with nice retention ( 4 ) [ 2005 ] a murky reddish brown , moderate head on this one ( poured much more gently to avoid sediment ) . ( 3.5 ) [ 2004 ] not so much of a red hue anymore ... more of a murky tea-brown with a reddish highlight to it , perhaps . quite a bit of sediment that slipped in , regardless of how gently it was poured .

S"reviewed as an american amber listed as 5.3 % abv , 177 cals p12os draft at the ab brewery tour in jax , fl 10/18/2009 a 3.0 - caramel-bronze amber color , little to no head - very weird as i know the bottle version always looks stellar ? could be the glass ? this surprises me as i drank this at the brewery tasting room . see my bottle review for a more accurate desc . s 3.5 - sublte malty presence , reminds me of a good brew day t 4.0 - `` respectable '' & `` balanced '' - more malty than hoppy . this is not a hoppy beer . maybe some hop notes on finish ? mf 3.0 - semi heavy carbo - mor ethan bottled version ? a bit thinner on body than i remember . d 5.0 - solid pick over most domestic macros , it 's a go to if the draft options are limited . i drink the 22 oz bottles all the time ."

S"a - hazy golden yellow . very very attractive color . the head is kind of lacking - not too big , not much retention , and little lacing . buttt ... it is a blonde ale afterall . s - floral citrus and yeast . some hops in there as well . t - follows the nose but pretty mild tasting overall . it 's very very refreshing , however , and it fits its description as a summer ale . m - a bit light . definitely not too light or `` lacking anything '' at all , but a bit light . carbonated well and well crafted overall . d - very very drinkable . i have a growler and it will be perfect for this night . sessionable , light , refreshing , and pleasant . glad this place just opened down the street . i 'm impressed with what i 've tried so far from wormtown - it 's ambitious and my money 's on it getting even better in time ."

S'poured from a vintage 2004 bottle it produces barely a finger head which almost the same exact color head as my three philosophers the night before had ( a tan with bassy golden tints to it ) this head melts away to nothing very quickly with almost no lacing . color was a dark reddish amber . i have a poor sense of smell so i went with todds vote of 4.0 the flavor begins with a rush of deliciously sweet hops followed quickly by a cloying pale ale strength hoppyness for just a moment before its all drowned in an overly strong alcohol presence which makes it take like its gone from a scottish strong ale to cough syrup and was utterly repulsive to me . im sure many would enjoy this but i just dont care for the flavor of alcohol in my beer nor do i like it in general such as say vodka . i couldnt make out the hop character at all till i started to eat something with it ( a roast with a sweet onion sauce ) which toned down the sweetness and brought it out . the mouth feel was nice and thick with a medium carbonation . i almost finished the glass but the alcohol was just too much . i think if they could tone it down to about % 7-8 and maybe hop it a little less ( i am by no means a hop head ) it would be very good and resemble a wee heavy ( one of my favorites ) but as it is i will gladly pass on this . this is the strongest beer ive had to date and frankly i think its just going too far . maybe it would work on a really cold night but i just dont tend to think of beer as something that should feel warm all the way down my throat .'

S"part of the nepa beer split . the banana wheat tinge reminds me of what is enjoyable about several dutch beers but the fruitiness seems a bit unbalanced with a malty kick riding against it . there is some dryness in the palate but the texture is a bit watery for a barley wine-style beer . the aroma is almost non existent except for some shades of cloves and bananas which figure prominently in the flavor . lots of cloves seem to be in the flavor so you probably do n't want to smoke one before sampling this beer !"

S'from an 11.2 oz bottle with a little white horse trinket on it , pours a cocoa-black color with a minimal head ... aroma is prunish , full of coffee , latte-like with obvious malts present ... very inviting ... taste is exceptional , very full-bodied and full of toffee , malts , and cappuccino-like , very thick and rich ... mouthfeel is equally great ... goes down smooth and is similar to drinking a dark latte ... drinkability is not exceptional , a little better than average , but the ultra-rich flavor and relatively high alcohol percentage is what restricted a higher score in that department ... overall , a classic german beer and a great representation of the style ... definitely recommended ...'

S"2007 on cork - 375ml bottle small , white bubbly head . a cloudy dull maroon color . i did n't even have to put my nose up to it to smell this one . i was at least 3 feet away and it was pungent . vinegar , deep , rich cheery aromas and a light sweetness all make up a wonderful funky bouquet of smells . slight hint of band-aid and barnyard funk . taste was unforgiving . lots of vinegar and sourness . you ca n't really even feel the carbonation until it hits the back of your throat because the sourness takes over your whole mouth . i feel it in the insides of my cheeks . as my mouth gets more accustomed to the drink i can start to taste a very light cherry flavor that develops in the aftertaste . the acidity of this beer is dominating . it coats my mouth with a buttery feeling and then leaves it dry like a merlot . amazingly , it has n't effected my teeth much . usually with sours they will start to feel a little sensitive and gritty . i have to say that at first i thought i was n't going to like this . i loved what it was giving me up to that first sip and then there was just a fierce vinegar flavor . once i warmed up to it , i started to love the beer and everything else that was hiding behind the sourness started to come out . all that nice wild yeast and bacteria flavor . it was like i was drinking the dregs . but wait no , it 's just the beer itself . i bet i can drink another bottle . but probably only on a good day for my stomach ."

S"eye : the color is a very dirty dark golden brown . head is very creamy , is an off white color , has great retention and lacing . maybe if it were clearer its appeal would be much greater . nose : one of the most potent brews that i 've had in a long , long time . even before the beer is out of the bottle and in the glass its aroma wafts up to my nose . the aroma is very sweet malty smell with little to no hop aroma . the closest association i can make with this aroma is bubblegum , though this is much better and more pleasant then bubblegum . other than that hard to describe , a bit of the classic `` duvel '' aroma in there , just there small but enough to convince you , were you unaware , that this is a very similar , if not the same style . tongue : great flavor , very sweet and extremely long lasting . malt obviously dominates the flavor , with an exception to yeast fermentation characteristics . i also detect some very fruity flavors , ca n't put a finger on what they are though , and definitely vanilla too . initially i find this to be a bit too sweet , almost cloyingly-ehh the flavor profile is n't all that great , i mean its just a bit too sweet/or there 's something to it that just tells me that this is one that you have to enjoy over a very long amount of time . mayhaps its the vanilla flavor that i dislike so ... . mouthfeel and drinkability : for a belgian pale ale this is definitely fuller in mouthfeel than i expected . almost velvet-like , very nice . alcohol is somewhat detectable , felt a bit of warmth as i was taking as sip , just there in the aftertaste , where vanilla reigns . would 've liked something a bit more crisp and not quite so full in body . usually i 'd get off on a full body , but that coupled with lower carbonation just makes this low alcohol , sweet , and very unbalanced ( as it should be-bpa , i mean supposed to be malty ) ale not all that great in the mouth , a bit more carbonation would be nice as well . this is definitely one of the more unique belgian pale ales i 've had . i must say that this is one that i do n't prefer over the others i 've had . though i am most likely comparing this brew to the likes of duvel , it should still have a similar , yet toned down flavor ... i just think that the almost cloying vanilla makes it hard to drink more than one of these in a sitting . all in all in my opinion this one is too cloying"

S"500 ml german bottle with no freshness date . brewed at weihenstephan from a base of barley and wheat , and spiced with bay leaves , ginger , caraway , anise , rosemary , gentian and `` pollinated wild hops . '' brilliant pale gold color , with an inch of noisy head that leaves no lacing . the bouquet starts with ginger and caraway and finishes with , well , ginger and caraway . on the palate there is mostly ginger and rosemary , contributing spice and pine respectively . a dash of malt is in there as well , along with some lemon and a slightly lower ph that helps keep the flavors bright . its very light , very dry and highly carbonated body gives the impression of tonic water . i doubt that this beer is in any way historically accurate , as i have trouble believing that any beer brewed in the 1200 's ( including small beer ) was this light in color , this dry , this lightly spiced and this cleanly fermented . however , it is possible that the gruit blend is accurate and i applaud prof. briem for at least spreading the knowledge of a long-forgotten family of beers . it is no doubt approachable and easy to drink - so much so that it could conceivably be a nice crossover beer for your macro friends - but i feel it lacks a bit in character ."

S'paid $ 1.49 for a single in washington , pa ... the beer pours a light golden base with a huge white head , perfect head retention and beautiful lacing effects along side the glass . the aroma is very fruitful and hoppy . the taste is a bit hoppier than most pils , almost to a strong hop level of a well-made pale ale or weak ipa . very light on the palette , light-bodied and a perfect session beer ! final thought : a very enjoyable pils from one of the best in the business . next time in pa i will consider purchasing a case of this one .'

S'as far as i am concerned this is the staple of deschuttes brewery . black butte is good stuff but this is quite possibly the most floral pale on the american market . this beer pours like a normal pale , light amber in color with decent head . the nose smells like a florists shop . fresh grass and flowers come out in the strong cascade hop flavor . very smooth and not bitter at all . a very unique pale . great brew .'

S"poured from a 12oz . bottle , to a pilsner glass . a : a very pale straw color , with virtually no head . a small residual amount of lacing presided upon finishing pouring it into the glass . s : average . some corn and hops . one thing that surprised me about this brew , is the lack of skunky/malty scent i was warned about . t : actually , i was impressed . it had a strigent taste , no after-taste . very good compared to many other canadian brews . m : smooth and crisp . nothing to write home about , but nothing to really complain about wither . d : it went down smooth , but would get pretty over-powering after a while . this is n't a brew meant to be slammed down like natty light . overall , a decent canadian brew ... worth a try !"

S"bought from sierra nevada , 2008 edition . bottled 354 day of 2007 . 2nd day in a row drinking this beer a - has a beautiful dark amber reddish coppery color , clear . good head when poured ( very light brown ) , buy diminished after time with little lacing . but it 's a barley wine so do n't expect much of that when drinking it slowely . s - very floral and spicy . can definitely smell the raw hop character from dry hopping , smells like the hop room at sierra nevada . t - has some lingering sweetness and good malty flavor . the amount of alcohol is just right . but the barley flavor and any other flavor is overshadowed by the hop character . that is one thing i would change about this barley wine , is take the hops down a notch or two . i really want to like this one , but too much resiny bitterness . and the aftertaste of hops stays too long , and too strong . but that 's what i would do to all sierra nevada 's beers . their beers would be awesome if they did n't drown with hops . i want to taste the malt , not the cheapest componet of the beer . m - the strength , sweetness , and hop resins give this beer a very good mouth feel , but once again not necessarilly a good mouthfeel . d - i like it , not love it . some bitterness is good , too much does n't make good for drinkability . but i like it and would buy it again . let 's see how it ages , as this is the 2008 and i got it fresh from the brewery"

S'had this from a 12 oz . bottle . i totally forgot about the hugh abv on this baby until half way through , so it pains me to say that i did not finish the bottle for i still had some beers i wanted to taste . bottle on 12/18/06 . a : amber/copper hue with some slight haze . big slow bubbles rising to the top . small head . a good looking beer . s : huge hop nose and i mean huge . all types of citrus character gives it a very sweet candy-like aroma . really a great aroma . t : incredible taste , sweet with an extremely dry finish . some coffee hints and surprisingly little hop bitterness . some alchol taste and warming . some grapefruit . to say this taste is complex is an understatement and aging would probably do wonders for this brew . m/d : sticky , thick and full bodied . drinkability is definately limited by the fullness and abv . little carbonation .'

S'i think i could use this stuff in my car as motor oil . it pours a thick , pitch black . i got no head to speak of . immediately hits you with an espresso aroma , and some bitter chocolate . this stuff is not kidding around . thick and chewy , tastes of dark espresso and bitter chocolate . perhaps some cereal . burnt acrid bitterness . hint of licorice . it really does seem like it would be appropriate for breakfast . personally , not my thing , it tastes like espresso in a beer bottle with some alcohol and much thickness . its like drinking an oil slick . no balance . at least it covers the high alcohol content .'

S"12 oz bottle from a 6-pack purchased at wine gallery in brookline . poured into a pint glass . this is an extremely clean and refeshing beer . while is n't anything in the way of off flavors , the flavor is pretty mellow . there is a little bit of lemon citrus and grassiness that combines with a mild malt sweetness . the hop bite comes through at the end . the body is on the full side for a pilsner , but it is extremely drinkable due to how clean it is going down ."

S'poured into my new brooklyn brewery pilsner glass with a minimal head . dark copper color very nice looking brew in the glass . the aromas are fruity and a tad spicy . a real chore to find any smells that come to mind . sediment floats all around the glass . taste-wise it is nothing to jump for joy about . wheaty yes but nothing else comes to mind . after the first sip there is lacing on the glass . boozy flavor with some bitterness . second glass with the bottle warmed up the brew is a chore to drink . this started to be a big let down and maybe the one dfh product i will not purchase again . it is a bit too boozy for me .'

S"poured into my hennepin glass . a : poured a nice copper/gold color , 1 finger white head that receded pretty quickly into a small ring/cap , leaves a little oily lacing that retreats quickly into the little ring around the edge . not bad . s : wow , this one is nice , grapefruit , a slight caramel malt , pine , orange , biscuits , a slight graininess , and a very nice floral hop . this one smells good ... . t : meh . let down by the flavor somewhat . starts off slightly bitter and piney , then turns to the caramel sweetness , then turns to the grapefruit and grain and then finishes slightly dry and spicy . weird combination , not horrible by any means , but very different than any other ipa i 've had . what makes it more weird is that it changes flavors so quickly that you do n't get enough of each component and it makes you want for more , one more sip to get more of each flavor . m : nice carbonation , little bit dry and lighter than expected for the style , especially the bitterness . was expecting a little more from flying dog , to be honest . d : meh , if the odd combination ( and quickness in which the flavors change ) is your thing , this is a very easy to drink beer . the alcohol is hidden completely ( imo ) and the bitterness is nowhere near enough to keep you from taking nice size sips of it . this one is devilish in that sense . i could see this being dangerous to someone who loves the flavors within . overall , an okay ipa . i 've certainly had worse , but i 've certainly had better . maybe if i can come across a fresh one , or better yet , on tap , i will review it again . i do n't know how fresh this one was , fwiw ."

S"wow . being a fan of american smoked porters , i was excited to try a rauchbier . i do n't think anything could have prepared me for this one , save a bottle of kc masterpiece . the beer pours a transparent dark brown/red color with a thin white head . good retention and lacing . the smell is pure smoked hickory , jerky , and anything else you would find at a barbecue pit . unfortunately the taste is the same . it is straight-up smoked meat , hickory , and barbecue sauce . i tried very hard to decipher `` beer '' qualities ( like hops or malt ) and just could n't find them . i 'm sorry to say i had a very difficult time even finishing this beer . the taste is that pungent . but i do understand what this beer is trying to accomplish , and appreciate its uniqueness , which is why i did n't slam its score . mouthfeel is clean and crisp . if you know what you 're getting into , love barbecued food ( enough to drink it ) , or want a completely new beer experience , try this rauchbier . personally it was a little too much for me to handle , and has probably made me gun shy toward other rauchbiers out there . i 'll stick to the american smoked ."

S"picked up a 22 oz bomber bottle from le petit vendome in la canada , california as it was on their new arrival list appended to the list we received last night at their holiday/belgian ale tasting . quite a strong , hoppy beer on the nose and the tongue . luscious liquid pouring a golden ray of sunshine with a bright head comprised of fine white bubbles . significant lacing and amidst a pleasant mouthfeel with a lingering bitter aftertaste not uncommon with such a highly hopped beer . fortunately , they make no bones about their forward flavors , with their label depicting large clusters of bountiful bloomin ' hops . not a favorite most personally , but certainly worth a try ."

S"well i was n't really in the mood for a weissbier but had to try this because it was the seasonal . i was very surprised at just how bold this weizenbock was . the unfiltered amber cloud was nice and gave a great head with enough retention time to make almost annoying . i kept having to wipe it out of my mustache . i was recently over my cold and really enjoying being able to smell again . this smell was really powerful . lots of esters ( banana , clove , currant ) . the taste was just as wonderful supplemented by a great aroma . the mouthfeel was stingy like i expected and the mouthfeel really was full . i have never found this particular style to be all that drinkable and this was certainly no exception . but i do n't think this is the kind of beer you buy to gulp ."

S"i found one lonely bottle of this at sam 's and i had to grab it . i really liked almost everything i 've had from kiuchi so i was excited about this one . it pours a clear , deep amber color with a beautiful cream colored head . aroma is that of sweet spices ( the bottle says that vanilla , coriander , cinnamon and nutmeg are used ) and roasted malt . the vanilla comes through the most in the first sip , nearly overshadowing the other spices used . good roasty flavor from the malt with a lot of residual sugars , overall a fairly sweet beer . beer there is very little hop flavor and bitterness , and were it not for the lack of it would probably make for a more balanced beer . mouthfeel is rich with the head being so fine and thick you could almost cut it . it is still refreshing though and leaves you wanting to drink more . this kind of reminds me of an abbey ale , with a higher residual sugar and of course spices . overall i think this a very good beer . probably too much head , too much vanilla and a lack of hops are my only complaints . i would not hesitate to pick it up again . i look forward to seeing if the beer is any different next winter . slinte"

S"i never review beers , but i always enjoy reading up on here when i am planning on a purchase . i just had to share my experience with this beer , so here goes : bought at growlers , hilton head sc while on vacation this week . growler cost me 14 bucks , figured it was a steal . store is very nice with a good selection of brews . not too pricey overall but definitely some good some bad buys there . brought it back to the beach house , got to pour one into a large tumbler ( one of the only things in the pantry ) . got about halfway through , then the swmbo and the puppy wanted to go for a walk on the beach . `` chug it , '' they said ! there was no way ! the thick syrupy mouthfeel alone would make be gag let alone piss off the beer gods . so i poured it into a not-so-obvious coffee mug and we went on our way . i have to say that it is the best beer i have ever drank out of a coffee mug while walking on the beach at sunset . i ended up sipping it even slower than i would back at the house , enjoying the moment with family i love . as far as an actual review , the appearance was so-so , didnt really look like anything amazing . smell was great , there are alot of things going on there including citrusy hops , biscuit malts , and a slight alcohol burn as it warms up . taste was more of the same , i actually liked it better when it got warm . it tasted more like a liquor than beer . mouthfeel like i said was thick and syrupy . drinkability is low , i might have a hard time finishing the growler by the end of the week without help . overall a great strong ale that i will definitely remember whenever i think about this vacation spot !"

S"i have a hazed latenight vision now of my friend towering over me talking to another old friend about this brew . we were all sitting on a low porch around a citranella candle , our smiling faces , and one inanimate donkey skull . we were overlooking 100 midnight acres as the low deck felt like a boat , anchored over the the sea of hay field . we worked hard through the dampening heat in the day , and i intorduced my friend on the animal sanctuary to coopers sparkling ale . i could think of no better beverage to cut the heat . it looks right cloudy *bottle clutched tightly in your hand while you smile enthusiasticaly - and there are a few sea horses playing russian roulette at the bottom of the bottle - sore eyeing you while giving you the finger and such ... . i 'm no fan of hoegarrden - but this beer draws a swift comparison when poured into a tall glass . ( *note if your on the farm - giver a shake , cuss at the moon , then drink straight from the bottle ) here hovever , the beer remains cloudy in a glass with great carbonation and zero head - sparkling ale eh ? - makes sense with the no head - this is the champagne of beers when pouring , follow the directions on the back of the bottle and stop short - so as to not bring the rest of the cussing monkeys to the party . they can be enjoyed afterwards with one good swig , and vitamin b goodness for you . taste is crisp , bubbly , and beyond refreshing . drinkability is the dominant part here for coopers sparkling ale - and not bad at 5.8 % coopers is like a horse that wo n't jump posts , but will head butt them , slag off the judges , and arrive later after the heat has died to enjoy 1 or 10 with you on the anchored boat , overseeing a thousand thirsty blades of grass . its real aussie ale"

S"this beer , i guess i 'm not a big fan of ipas . it was a very hoppy beer and explained that way . `` big bold and hoppy '' . a dark amber color and a good aroma . the flavor was very very strong , alcohol was way present but buried in the flavor of the beer . there was a distinct raisin flavor while going down and left a black licorace flavor . mouthfeel and taste just seemed average , but it 's average for microbrews . i had a sample of dogfish head 90 min . ipa , and that was much more rounded and better finished than this beer . i had to finish this one slowly , so it 's not very drinkable , maybe as the last beer of the night and slow so you can really appreciate the taste ."

S"nice off-white two-finger head , which leaves a good lace on the glass . color is solid amber and clear . okay , how can this be ? this beer smells like vegetable soup , with perhaps a touch of salisbury steak . i do n't smell any hop or malt . egads ! the flavor has some hop bite to it . after that , the taste became metalic . there is some noticeable malt , but the aroma is overwhelmingly distracting . the finish is very , very short . on the positive side , it has nice body with good carbonation . sorry guys , my worst pale ale homebrew is better than this . i 'm curious how this is made . you must be doing something unusual to create a beer like this ."

S"clear brass bodied with a skin of pale gray suds and a some pockets of bubbles clinging to the edge . not much retention , but gobs of lace down the sides of the glass . lime rind and dry grass hoppiness , with blooms of tropical fruit ( mango , mostly ) . rye adds its distict peppery spiciness , and enhances the grassy qualities . rye is perceived immediately in the mouth , lightly doughy and perkily peppery . malt fades quickly , though the spiciness lingers . hops join with a dried grass and herb , that broadens over time to include mint , lime , papaya , and sandy minerality . later on , burps add pine and resin , curiously , the first time they appear . the body enters puffed out , and nearly brawny feeling , but it deflates over the course of the sip , leaving it limp and thin by the swallow . this is a small gripe , as it 's monster drinkable . i 'm a big fan of rye , simply put . and this succeeds in that aspect . the rye , though , competes with , and seems to alter the hop profile , and at the end , it 's not clearly recognizable as a bitter woman spinoff . i 'm not 100 % sure how i feel ( mostly because i expected a more `` bitter woman-esque '' hop clarity ) , the rye has won me over and i 've gone through a couple four packs over the weekend , and i 'll be restocking soon . update : the more i drink of this , the more i 'm left somewhat nonplussed . the rye and the hops just do n't really jive ."

S"deep clear golden color here , whit a strong fluffy white head . north coast beers have some of the strangest and stiffest heads , almost as if you could mold it like putty , but there are plenty of naturally weird shapes already in the head . not too exciting in the aroma dept . . a little bit of spicey hops in the nose ... and traces of malt . taste is also rather unimpressive , with a metallic fruity type taste jumping out at me at first , but not too mch else really . dull maltiness is there , along with some slight floral hops . the mouthfeel is full and finishes powdery . that 's right , it finishes powdery , like bitterness gone wrong . pretty drinkable despite this . average , there are way better red or pale ales out there ."

S"appearance : this stuff basically looks like your average apple juice with some bubbles . nothing terrible but definitely nothing to write home about . smell : the smell is probably the worst part of this ... beer . it really just smells like sweat and unfortunately vomit to an extent . i would not advise snifting this stuff if you do n't want to get sick . taste/mouthfeel : if the smell is not the worst part of this beer , then the taste is , especially considering that drinking this in large amounts is generally the point . tastes very bitter but actually not too overwhelming for the first few sips/gulps when it 's still cold . cobra unfortunately gets very warm and full of gross sediment as it warms . but by the time you finish , you will probably be feeling this stuff so it wo n't matter much . drinkability : like i said , as you drink this stuff it warms , but the buzz encourages you to finish ... taste discourages you to do so . overall : do n't sit around sipping this beer . honestly , only drink this if you plan on getting buzzed , and even that 's not worth it ... you will probably regret it . update : i will not change my review , considering i have had this beer more than several times . it is not good most of the time . however , i did have some of this stuff to go with a burger at a tailgate , and was quite pleasantly surprised . maybe give that a try ."

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a dt snifter . there was a bottling code lasered below the label but no way to decipher it . it 's a winter seasonal so should be pretty fresh . it was pitch black in color with carb streams evident on the surface . it had a very large brown head that whittled down to a thick collar and foam . good sheeting with slow sliding but non sticking lace . the aroma was very good . heavy on espresso , coffee grounds , a bit of chocolate and some creme but not the amount i expected based on the label description . great coffee aroma but i would n't have minded some more choc or creme in there to offset it a bit . the taste follows the aroma . heavy coffee taste with more of the sweet from the creme showing up but still could use a little more for me . needs more non-coffee balance for my personal taste but i 'm going to score it high since it does nail being a coffee beer . mouthfeel is creamy with good carbonation and good after-taste . overall , a really good coffee stout especially after having several so-so ones lately . this one definitely delivers the coffee aroma and taste . for me , a little more sweet to balance it and it would be perfect . this one is worthy of the hype . highly recommend . rotation - mi only release so got thru other sources . if avail here might be a couple singles per season . got a couple to age now so will try again in several months ."

S"poured into a stemmed tulip : reddish-amber , translucent with glowing orange highlights . loads of fast nucleation bubbles . a finger of beige head that falls to a thick , bubbly coating . smells of cooked orange & grape , very sugary , with some other baking-like herbs & spices . kind of a holiday potpourri of sorts . just a slight twist of earthy funk , & a tiny savory character ( soy sauce ? ) . taste is a little savory too , like vegan jerky , if this makes sense to anyone . also some bitter orange aspects , some sugary grape , heat from booze . a subtle smokiness rounds this off & makes it a little more interesting . ca n't say i love the taste , but it 's entertaining to dissect . a big mouthfeel , pretty full & `` chewy , '' with the heat i mentioned above . there 's an impression of grittiness , even , like there are particulates of some type , though i do n't see any in this glass . i 'm noticing a trend of higher abv amber belgian styles that i 'm not crazy about -- the alcohol is too hot , the flavors muddled , not crazy about it . this is right in line with those characteristics . there are some interesting things going on , but they do n't outweigh the toll that this takes on your palate & sobriety . kind of disappointing ."

S'well i have to say that the belgians really do seem to know what their doing when it comes to beer , and this beer does not disprove that . the most notable thing about the appearence of this beer was definately the head it was the most impressive one that i think i have ever seen . it was huge and very fluffy like beaten egg whites and it lasted for the duration of the beer slowly becoming smaller . the color was a vivid orange gold and the carbonation was very swirling like underwater currents in my goblet style glass . the smell was also quite good it was quite strong and lent you a whiff with every sip . it was light not in magnitude but in character . it had a very tart fruit like smell which made me think of apples , pears and maybe a little citrus . and as it warmed a little sweetness became apparent which gave it a caramel apple tone . the taste was in a word great . it was mildly bitter and was much like the smell . cold right out of the fridge it was a little crisper and more tart giving off a fruity and perhaps peppery character . and as it warmed it began to take on a little more rounded warmer flavor with some definate caramely sweetness again giving the caramel apple connotation and along with the alcohol which was pretty high this was a very full-bodid beer . the mouthfeel was almost foamy and just a little slick a lot lick an egg -white meringue . but the tingling also came through in a very mild sweep that washed your mouth with the smaller than average bubbles . the drinkabilitywas unfortunately not that great it was very sippable but the 1.9 pint bottle was definately a plogging , trudging process to get to the end of . overall i would highly recommend this beer .'

S"if you like guiness or guiness extra stout then this beer is for you . it costs a little less too . i poured 2 cold 12oz bottles into a frosted 24oz glass mug . the appearance , smell and taste are very close to guiness extra stout . very roasty-toasty-malty liquid bread flavor . at 5.6 % alcohol it is `` up there '' for a beer of moderate price . after all we are reviewing alcoholic products here folx . my only problem with 1554 is that the effect of the alcohol in this made me feel drowsy and `` low '' . i had a shiner bock after and it brought me back to a happy state . as with all beers , wines and distilled spirits , there are many alcohols , esters , ketones , etc . present after production and aging ( we do n't want a course in organic chemistry ! ) and these chemicals affect the brain , and of course the `` euphoric feel '' of the drink . my impression is : if you like extra dark beer like guiness then you will love this . but it made me feel lethargic and drowsy . this is why i lowered it 's score on drinkability ."

S"thanks to beerman207 for picking up a growler of this and being kind enough to share it with me . review is from notes taking on 12/18/2009 . poured from the growler to a pint glass . appearance : pours the deepest brown/near black like cola ; starts with a 1 and 1/2 figner light tan head that fades moderately slowly to a full and slightly uneven head ; drink is nearly opaque ; oily rings of lacing try to cling to the glass . smell : definite presence of deep dark fruity esthers and a definite whiff of alcohol - nose is pretty strong and begins to show hints of chocolate as it warms . taste : quite nice with the deep dark fruits ( fig , date , raisin ) ; hints of a semi-sweet chocolate ; presence of a warming alcohol that is better blended than i thought it would be based upon the smell ; slight roastiness as well . mouthfeel : thick and chewy ; nice coating on the roof of the mouth ; nice smooth carbonation and the belly is definitely left warm . drinkability : wonderful smell , flavors and mouthfeel , but the abv is too high for too much . definitely a great sipper when the weather is cool and i 'm glad i finally got to try this since it did n't show up in bottles around here ."

S"poured at about 18 or 19c into a thistle/tulip glass . best b4 date : 22/12/08 . the aroma is very peaty & earthy . there is a ... sour smelling smoke aroma ( if an aroma can be sour ) . there is more peat in the nose of this beer than in most scotches that i have tasted , with the exception of lagavulin and maybe a couple of others . in my glass this beer looks onyx black . it produces a medium sized beige head . medium to low head retention . some lace is left clinging to the sides of my glass . the flavour is dominated by the smoke & peat . there is a hint of dark chocolate trying to fight through the smoke & earthy peat . the smoke is acrid & sour , which sounds terrible , but i sort-of like it as it provides some balance to what i believe would otherwise ( assumption ) be sweet malt flavours ( i 'm not picking up much hops ) . the high alcohol percentage is well hidden . mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium bodied . the carbonation is just right , providing enough effervescence to liven things up without being too fizzy . overall , i think that this is a very unique beer & quite interesting . it is not overly complex as the smoke & peat truly dominate , leaving little room for much else . i do like it and would recommend to others that they try it ."

S"the method of delivery was a 12 oz brown bottle . there is light yellow label with a yellow border . at the top is the bell 's logo . taking up most of the middle is a square with the name `` batch 9,000 ale '' in it . it also states that this is a commemorative brew and that it is brewed with molasses and brewer 's licorice . when i poured it into a glass , it had a dark brown coloring to it . there was just a hint of a ruby or garnet tint . this is a very dark and thick looking beer . it 's so opaque that as some light passes through , but only at the edges . a beige head formed consisting of tiny , dense bubbles . it fades slowly to a film at the top of the beer and a ring around the edge of the beer . there is some lacing on the glass . there is a strong and intense aroma to this beer . mostly it is of dark fruits , molasses , cherries and bourbon . you can also detect the noticeable smell of alcohol . the flavor is very complex . you can make out a distinct combination of plums , dates , toffee , bourbon , vanilla , some spice and alcohol . the flavor opens up more as the beer warms closer to room temperature . it 's hard to pin point any single taste that over powers the others , they mix together in a strong , but pleasant style . this is a medium to heavy bodied beer . there is some coating in the mouth . there is some burning from the high 12.5 % abv when swallowed , and a warming in the stomach . i was really impressed with this beer . it tasted fantastic ; however , drinking it on a day where the temps reached the 90 's probably was n't the best idea . this is more of a cold/cooler weather beer . the burning sensation coupled with a hot summer day really distracts from the beer . the high abv , while noticeable , really does not distract from the overall taste of the beer . this is a limited edition beer , so if you can get your hands on it , i would recommend picking one up . if you do , i would put it in a cool and dark pace to store for a cool fall or winter night to enjoy ."

'' and my review : a : dark brown . not much head . s : spices ! very very heavy on the spices . a little malts come through as well . t : more spices ! holy shit , it 's a spice bomb ! too much spices in the taste . no oak or anything else that the description promised . almost like a candied belgian , but not in a good way . m : about like i 'd expect for this beer . pretty heavily carbonated . d : finished the first , do n't want another . i came away thinking this was a weak impersonation of the stone/ngne/jolly pumpkin special holiday ale . i usually love copper creek , but this one did n't do it for me ."

S"the problem with light beer is that it 's awful and it gives the u.s. a bad name in the beer world amongst those europeans who think they make manly beers with their `` pilsners . '' ( ha ! ) this beer 's no good . it looks ok , it smells like water , it tastes like water and bread , it feels like water and is as drinkable as water . ca n't sense any hops and only minimal malt . no head , teeny tiny bit of lacing . in terms of light beer , though , it 's easily the most tolerable . give me this over and light beer mass-produced any day . give me most any other beer ( even a pilsner ) over this any other day , though . the best in its style , but i do n't rate according to style ."

S"12 oz bottle poured into an irish pint glass . look : pours a very cloudy , bright yellow . the head is white and fluffy and is about two fingers thick . carbonation is visible . it leaves behind layers of nice lacing . smell : i get lemon zest , hints of banana , a lot of spice like the coriander and cloves and the smell of the yeast . there 's also some wheat smell as well . taste : wheat with a lot of lemon zest flavor along with the spices . banana and yeast are also there but the zest and the spices are there first and foremost . its very sweet . feel : thin bodied with a very crisp amount of carbonation . its very sweet without any detectable bitterness . drink : exceptionally easy to drink . overall , i like this one . i decided i need a break from big beers for awhile and thought this would be a good place to start and i was right . very good witbier and i 'm glad i had it . i recommend it thoroughly and will check out the rest of allagash 's work as a result ."

S"appearance : pours a clear , deep copper-hued body with a 2 finger-high head comprised of creamy-looking , off-white foam . smell : a rather expressive aroma smelling richly of toffee-flavored syrup , vanilla frosted , flaked coconut , stinging bourbon , and 'grade b ' maple syrup . taste : leads with a very full sweetness and tastes of toffee , vanilla , maple , coconut , and bourbon coming together like a liquor-soaked cake . just as i 'm quietly soaking in the sweetness , a moderate amount of hop bitterness and a kick of hot , merciless booze rocks the tongue . touch of tannic wood character as well . a few drops of further condensed wheat malt extract . jerks back and forth and between the sweet , the heat , and the bitterness until you finally reach that warm finish . mouthfeel : full-bodied . medium-light carbonation . smooth , sure , but it sits rather heavily on the tongue . drinkability : without a doubt , a bold brew from top to bottom . a very slow , leisurely sipper for me . in a sitting , one bottle , heck , even half a bottle is enough for me . i 'll be sure to revisit the remaining bottles starting at the one-year mark ."

S"found hennepin on draft at a winking lizard in columbus and i could n't pass it up . i always like to try belgian and belgian-style beers i 've had in the bottle on draft to compare the flavors . typically , i find these beers to be rounder ( more balanced ) and not as complex and flavorful as their bottled counterparts . this particular glass of hennepin on draft was typical in that regard . i missed some of the rustic character of the brew on draft , but instead was left with a sweeter , less dry wheaty tasting ale , that was nonetheless quite refreshing . this beer was not as visually appeailing as the bottled version and lacked the mousse-like head of its bottled counterpart , although the aroma was still fairly bright with notes of vanilla . a white pepper spicines tended to come out a little more as the beer warmed up . the mouthfeel was very soft , with a little bit more of a bitter finish coming out as the beer warmed up . perhaps served too cold . this was exceptionally drinkable at the right temperature ."

S"interesting 24 ounce bottle that looks like some space age sex toy ... .i damn near expected this thing to start vibrating when i twisted the cap off to get to the bottle part to open it . i seemed to be one of the minority who actually liked the fredrick miller chocolate lager ... i expected something similar with this one but it is not in the same league . i will say this ... i am stunned to see this is 8.5 % . iabv feels more like 4.5 % or 5 % ... .but unfortunately there is n't a lot to like about this beer . sure there is some mild cocoa notes on the aroma and taste but it is subtle and the problem is there is n't much depth beyond that ... no bad off tastes or anything like that but just not much that impresses either . i could care less if ab or surly made this beer ( as i am not a macro hater ) because my opinion would be the same ... .not recommended ."

S'a : dark serpia pour leaves a skim fizzy , nutmeg colored head that barely had enough time to establish before dissipating . no lacing . dark and brooding in the glass like liquid chocolate . s : the nose provided a light smoky essence of dark rich chocolate . a bit of coffee roast , alcohol , along with some dark fruit of prunes shows up as well . so far not much presence of its 10.8 % abv is noticed kept well in check . t : dark and bitter with a full roastiness . smoked malt with bitter dark chocolate pairs up with an earthy bitterness of roasted coffee beans . the alcohol is apparent , mingled in with some dark fruit of prunes and dates coming off very warming on the finish . a sweet burnt currant factor and burnt cake breadiness with an emphasis on roasted bitterness lingers about long after the swallow . m : full viscose feel , oily in texture , comes off heavy like a mouthful of motoroil , but tasting much better . bitter on the tongue with hardly a trace of carbonation . a particular burnt bitterness teases the bitter sensory buds of the tongue with high expectations while warming alcohol notes occur on the inner cheeks . d : take this one slow sip at a time , a full roasted bomb worthy of a special occasion . this would go incredibly well on a chilly fall night around a camp fire with the smell of freshly burning amber , smoked salmon and grilled potatoes .'

S'the 2009 release pours from the bottle , rich dark walnut , syrup with ruby highlights , and becomes more chestnut with each sip . totally without any head or carbonation . however , each swirl puts up amazing viscous legs , which continue to dance for a good long while . the aroma reached out form the snifter glass from at least ten feet away , with a strong bourbon or cognac . the alcohol fumes are powerful , just as expected . underneath this are cinnamon , nutmeg , fresh ground pepper , ginger , dark dried fruits , truly a wonderland for the olfactory . there is little progression , as it is served relatively warm , but noting is lacking here . once the initial burn of alcohol leaves , each sweet sip reveals more complexity and layers . maple/bourbon turns to raisins and figs . molasses turns to vanilla with a particular nuttiness . comparisons with distilled spirits weave throughout . there may even be a fair comparison to a fine chianti . the finish is more hot spirits , but lacking the typical beer experience . i admit to licking $ 1 worth , from the wall of the glass ! rich and smooth , with the texture of syrup , no carbonation , but the alcohol cleanses the palate rather well . one of the better full bodied beers , this is highly satisfying . utopias should be reserved for a life altering celebration or an occasion where it is the focus . while this is an amazing beer , it has few of the standard qualities of beer . one or two ounces at a time is plenty . so , amazing as it is , i find it difficult to say this is especially drinkable . i hope to have another someday , and certainly expect to enjoy it just as much . as for cellaring , i wonder how much it can progress beyond its current state . oh , and it floods back autumn memories , sitting on the porch with grandpa , his cigar , and evening drink .'

S"( a ) poured out of the most exceptionally retro lime-green can with a happy , flower-pickin ' goat on the front . it produces a good 1.5 finger head in my wide-brimmed verboden vrucht goblet . the head has a whipped cream look which is interrupted with large bubbles coming up throughout . this display quickly recedes to a white film on top with clumpy lacing . the color is a rich brown with chestnut highlights . this is a $ 6/12 pack beer ? ( s ) smells of caramelized malt and raisins with a substantial bready quality . i like bready beers . seriously , this is a $ 6/12 pack beer ? ( t ) faintly sweet caramel with a very mild but present hop bitterness . i 'm finding a lot of the complexities are being obscured by a prominent boozy taste . i 've had these in my cellar since january and i 've noticed the booziness become increasingly pronounced with age . too bad , but this beer is really intended to be consumed fresh . the aftertaste is very similar to genesee cream ale - i do n't mind that one bit . ( m ) quite nice . thinner than a german bock , but thinner is good in this case . the carbonation is smooth on the tongue , and not at all stinging or soda-like . a well balanced arrangement here . ( d ) again ( and for the last time ) this is a $ 6/12 pack beer ? a great beer for the money ( or a good beer in general ) , and spot on for the rather forgotten style of 20th century american bock beers . i plan to stockpile next january on this once-a-year and unusually affordable treat . a near-perfect session beer ."

S"my first encounter with the famous sam smith oatmeal stout . thanks to the holiday gift pack i get to try one . i 've heard really good things about this beer . pours just beautifully into my giant pilsner . a huge 2 inch head that foams up , but eventually settles down to cover the surface of this deep reddish-brown opaque brew . lots of lacing . smells like a good stout should . malt , coffee , and earthy . roasty nature to the smell . promises wonderful things ahead ... taste is very good . a fantastic balance of bitter and sweet . delivers on everything the smell hinted at . its rather sweet for a stout , reminds me a lot of mackeson 's xxx . great aftertaste and a pleasant warming feeling in the back of your throat . creamy and oh-so smooth . not terribly complex , but what is there is splendid . samuel smith 's oatmeal is a great stout . i have two issues with this beer . first , there is no dating information on the bottle ( or any of sam smith 's brews ) so you have no idea if what you buy is 2 or 24 months old . secondly , they use a clear glass bottle , which i suspect has been a factor in the few funny tasting bottles of sam smith i 've had . i know , i know , a lot of microbrews are guilty of these same faults , but really -- if i 'm going to spend $ 3 per bottle , it 's not asking too much . that said , this is a fine beer and certainly worth a try . it 's my favorite of samuel smith 's brews and i 'll certainly buy it again . if you cant afford this , an excellent alternative is the aforementioned mackesons ."

S"poured into a pilsner glass out of a 355ml bottle . freshness date is listed as `` 03/11/12/ . '' appearance is dark , filled with a murkiness that makes it impossible to see through the glass . there 's a small creamy head visible , as well as substantial carbonation . does n't look too bad . smells of roasted malts with some coffee , darkened chocolate , as well as some light blackberries . neverthless , there 's a strange smell lurking beneath all of these delightful varieties . some kind of strong , grainy aroma that makes everything feel a little off , if not sadly unbalanced . this beer completely throws itself off of a cliff when it comes to flavor and body , however . it starts with a sweetened maltiness , feels creamy and full , and then proceeds to end up in an astringent , unpleasant aftertaste . it 's wholly remarkable how progressively bad this beer comes with each new sip . there 's a burnt backdrop to highten the mood , and then a thinness that dazzles itself through to quickly throw everything off balance . if that does n't make things any worse , the coffee notes dispel and are replaced by rotten , sulfurous , yeasty notes . a uncomfortable drinking experience , to say the very least . this could be used as a winter warmer for masochists who do n't mind a terrible drinking experience in order to warm their faces up successfully . the first beer i 've had since pbr that i could n't bring myself to drink more than 3 ounces . a definite drainpour . yikes ."

S"live review . poured from a 22 oz . bomber into my ommegang witte tumbler . purchased for $ 5.99 at warehouse beverage on mayfield in cleveland about 2 weeks ago . no observed `` best by '' or `` freshness date '' found by me on label or the bottle . 5.5 % abv . a visible sediment on the bottom of the bottle before opening . pours a moderately dark yellow translucent body under a one inch creamy head that lasted for only a minute or so . 3.5 s nice light wheat smell with some malt sweetnes , some hops but way in the distance . 4.0 t light wheat with a bit of hops . reminds me of ommegang witte . nearer the bottom of the bottle taste improved in that there were more tastes to be had as i went through the bomber . the first sips ( from the top of the bottle ) were considerably thinner than the sips gained from the bottom of the bottle . 3.5 m as stated , light . low abv and minimal hop taste contribute to that as well . 3.0 d very high , as expected from the style . i could have many of these . 4.5 notes : another in a long line of brew keeper beers that i will be drinking and rating . this one , very much in the style of ommegang witte , is a great local alternative to witte . both beers have great drinkability ."

S"a - this holiday brew is dark chestnut brown with a hint of deep beet color when held to the light . the head is very small and short lived after pouring . oddly , a quick swirl brings up a beautifully thick beige head . that 's really strange since i poured this one relatively aggressively . huh . to be fair , i 'll score this one on the head that built up after the swirl . the lace is silky and finely bubbled , and sticks well too . nice looking brew ! s - before putting my nose to the glass , i can already smell mashed brown-spotted bananas or banana baby food ( my personal favorite ) . getting closer , i pick up a ton of banana , hearty yeast ( almost hefe-like ) , and super-ripe fruit notes . big time apricots , dates , and maybe even a little maraschino cherry/grenadine . this is delicate , but still deep and brooding . outstanding . t - mashed sweet-potatoes with marshmallows , dried apricots , prunes , dates , fruit cake , and minty spruce . this is screaming `` holiday beer '' big time . soft and juicy orange flavors remind me of those little sugary jelly orange wedges crusted in sugar : the ones that are made of the same stuff as gummy bears but look like an artificial orange wedge . some spices make things interesting , but never overpower the nice dried fruit notes . i wish more spiced holiday brews had this kind of restraint . m - full bodied and sugary . this one is slick like sweet sugary candy , but has a touch of dryness from the spice . would be a little better if it were n't so cloying , but then again this beer is all about a christmas pudding/desert vibe and the mouthfeel matches the flavors . the high abv is totally hidden . i was completely surprised when i read the label after taking a few sips . i was expecting maybe 6 % , but 9.5 % ... daaang ! d - this is a great desert brew or nightcap for a cold winter evening spent in pajamas . i would n't want more than one , but that 's okay . this one will last me a while as i swirl sniff , and slowly sip . i 've been less than impressed with lakefront in the past , but this is a really well built brew ."

S'this one takes me back ... i can feel the wild yeast strains floating through the brewery window , lazily landing on my tongue like a ballet of dry sour sprites- interested only in providing barnyard funk for my cherry-induced pallet . i taste the usual suspects of a farm house- leather fruit and unmistakable citric rot . shocking . i see the bright-raisiny orange/red/brown syrupy sun-bleached , sticky sour cherries condensing in a lumpy puddle of their own , only waiting to be recycled by the unassuming brew consumer . i literally feel the belgian breeze strike my face as i take this one down , followed by intense visions of ripe-grass hill sides and aged white plaster , weathered brown wooden support cottages ... with cherries in the window sills .'

S'a : cloudy gold with a thin white head . decent lacing . typical wheat beer look s : subtle wheat and lemon , nothing powerful in the nose t : crisp wheat flavor with a wondefully balanced lemon flavor . the lemon is actually complex , there are a couple citrus flavors at play here without being sour . this beer suprised me . at first sip if you told me it was the summer ale i would have believed you , but its softer than summer ale , with a more rounded flavor . m : medium body with a clean , dry , crisp finish . d : not sure why this is the new spring beer . to me its more of a summer beer . its very similar to summer ale ( i think it may be better , but its been 9 months since ive had summer ale . ill have to try a side by side ) . in my mind though , sam adams needs a bock , not another beer similar to two they already have . that said its very drinkable and refreshing , i like it , i just dont quite understand it .'

S"a dark ol iipa . almost no head , but what was there turned into clingy lace . aroma was sweet . taste was massively bitter . this is like a triple ipa . the hop flavor is dominated by massive amounts of bitterness and a lesser degree of alcohol . may not have any dry hopping , ca n't tell . the mouthfeel is just puckering . tears you up in a good way . price doubled in one year , never came back down after the hop shortage , thus making one of the world 's most bitter beers rate even lower on the drinkability scale ."

S"on bottle . a single purchased at deluca 's on charles st. in boston , ma . the closest on bottle to a cask conditioned ale that i have had yet . pours with little or no head . very little carbonation and aroma . suprisingly hoppy , yet not overpowering . very refreshing and well balanced . if i wanted to introduce someone to a cask conditioned beer to someone who has n't been to the uk or has n't had a cask here i would serve them this.i wish it came in at least a four pack ."

S'this beer pours a semi-cloudy pale amber color . the head is one inch in height and recedes slowly into nice lacing . the aroma is of citrus with underlying pine . the taste is a lot more piney than the aroma indicates it should be . the mouthfeel is horrible . even though this beer formed a nice head , it has absolutely no carbonation . it is also very oily , masking the flavor . overall , this beer has a very nice appearance and aroma , but the mouthfeel and taste make it nearly undrinkable .'

S"like most , i came at this beer from a bad perspective to begin with , so please hear me out theres a moral here . i love the stooges ok. im also a bottle collector so this beers novelty packaging is must have stuff for me . so i got a six pack for my collection and it sat for some time til i was completely out of beer . unfortunately this occurred just before i ended up on a 4 hr push session on a finicky harley on a hot spring day . i got in tired and dying of thirst . i headed for that beer with all the primal needs of a beerless homer on a dry spell . i gulped it down when it was just cooler tna room temp ... . but , i expected it to be undrinkable drek like most of the yankee corporate swill i have tasted . i was absolutely amazed at the way this beer went down ; no rough after tastes , indicative of cheap ingredients or sloppy process . nope , this was one hell of a good thirst quenching beer ! i figure nobody would ever consider me seriously if i rated this novelty stooge beer as on par with the best national canuck brands . i also doubted my senses . liking novelty beer from a us corporate cintract brewer ? made no sense to me . i thought i was suffering from hot-day-cold-beer-any-port-in-a-storm syndrome . i found out the stooges beer in canada was contract brewed by lakeport in hamilton ... a decent all malt brewer of canadian commercial brands . results : color : ranges from light straw head medium and disappears to a fine lace quickly . smell : virtually undetectable , slight yeasty , and sweet malty smell under the tang of light carbonation . palate : nice reception , not dry not bold . exceedingly smooth blend of grains , malt , slight hops.but all very subdued ( cold aged fer sure ) . finish : crisp with absolutely no after taste . this is a commercial beer drinkers beer of premium quality and process . this brew turns out to be as good or better than lakeport 's premium breands so this is why the canadian-made stooges will stand the test of stand alone drinkability . as a canadian-brewed contract beer , this beers quality puts it in the top 3 us lagers . i like it . it takes a lot to impress me with the rivers of beer ive sampled . this is a very unexpected surprise ! try this canadian version of stooges . do it in the right frame of reference and you will be pleasantly surprised . the moral : us brands contracted by canadian brewers are usually improved because the standard process here omits rice , corn or other adjuncts used in the same brands in the us ."

S'poured from a 12 oz . to a pint glass . the cloudy liquid is a medium dark yellow . a plain white yet very fluffy head . not exactly what i had expected and a little disappointing . the smell is very faint , not much to go on a little spice is all i get . the taste is a little much better , kind of interesting . a sweet spicy mix of malt and some kind or tangy taste . mouthfeel is not so good kind of lays on the tongue like soda-pop , also thin yet buttery . drinkability is surprisingly not so bad , you could section this beer and not get sick of it . many more much better beers out there for the price i will not buy again , but if it was mixed in with a bunch of macros at a party and i grabbed on that would be great . mk'

S"a : when poured , it bubbles up for a short while , then the tiny head dies and it continues to bubble from underneath strongly . s : update : the smell on this seems hit or miss . the first bottle i opened had the disgusting scent of a skunk 's ass hole . now several days later i worked up the courage to attempt another of the remaining five bottles , and it smells of citrus . without the intolerable skunk smell , this beer is actually not bad . unfortunately , if the other reviews are any indication , getting a skunk or a citrus seems random . t : very little taste was present here . stella artois mostly just tastes like watered-down malt and toasted nuts . it is n't bad tasting , but there 's just not much going on here . m : the mouthfeel is bubbly and active , keeping the beer interesting . d : even when it smells like skunk , i can drink this stuff . it does n't taste bad and goes down as easily as any other beer with so little taste . however , playing roulette with the smell seems a bit odd . hope for a nice citrus scent and you 'll enjoy this beer . otherwise , you may just clear a room ."

S"starting to really love this brewery 's beers ... .again with the over the top head . this pours a super clear lemon yellow - massively carbonated and coats of lacing . another beautiful pour . aromas are as expected - some bready malt , some citrus peel . not as robust by any means as the vitus , but still good . also some lavender in there , and maybe some other herbaceous notes - like marjoram , way in the back . flavor lacks the punch of their other beers . this is clearly meant to be a session beer that appeals to non-beer drinkers . 5.4 % abv proves this to be the case . starts off bready and crisp , without much of either the citrus or herb notes present . it ( d ) evolves into a very thin wash of crispness that has the faint hint of what might be hops . finish is short , to the point , and thin . i think it obviously accomplishes its goal , but unfortunately , in my opinion , it 's an `` own goal '' at final tally . like usual , super well-priced at $ 2.79/pint+.9oz . bottle . what i like most : the price and beautiful pour . what i like least : the thin flavor profile . verdict : even at $ 2.79/bottle , not truly worth it unless you want to drink a lot of beer on a hot day ."

S"it came to me a crystal clear , bubbly straw yellow , with a tight white lager head the dwindled rapidly . it looked rather pretty in the light , actually . the aroma was quite macro-esque , with a slight hoppy metallic tang , but the sweet malt notes were a bit more full than in the average macro . but , the corn was there as well . the first sip delivered an almost rock-candy sweetness on board , with real notes of the cracked corn and light malt that conjured it up . the hops bittered the sweet melange , but did little in the line of flavoring it all . overall , the flavor profile was thing and dropped off quickly as the malt ebbed , leaving a crisp , slightly bittered finish . light bodied , it slid right across the palate with nary a delay . it left little in the line of memories once gone . jimmy cracked the corn , but in the summer heat , i would not care . it 's thin , sweet , and per the old folks i 've talked to , right in line with what they remember of the olden lagers of yore . there 's nothing here to call anything more than good , save the nice look at the outset , but man does it go down smooth and easy . it 's a novelty , but in the sun with sweat on my brow , i 'd have no issue with making it a more mainstream indulgence ."

S"packaging can do wonders for any product & sa 's triple bock is no exception . the translucent blue , corked bottle is as seductive a vessel in which i 've seen a beer contained . equally dramatic is the deep , dark liquid that oozes from the mouth of the bottle into whatever glass ( hopefully a cordial ) you 've chosen . unfortunately , this is where the pleasure ends & the terror begins . the triple bock is alarmingly sweet smelling & this warning sign is proven justified as the first sip ( & all sips subsequently ) provides a taste best described as a type of walnut syrup . from both a drinkablility & flavor standpoint , this `` beer '' simply fails on a grand scale . strangely , this brew is hard to hate outright , because it is fearlessly original & obviously a labor of love . yet , it is so exclusionary to all but the very few that it can not be given high marks for the beer community at large . while i usually feel most of the boston brewing co.

S"black as the ace of spades with dark brown overtones when held up to the light . fairly good head that left about an eight of an inch or so on the top till i was about halfway finished . clumpy lacking . pretty nice looking . smells of molasses , coffee , chocolate , fruits ( probably prunes ) , anise , slightly alcoholic , and a distinct overtone of the frio river in texas ( i know that 's a strange quality to mention , but that 's what the smell reminds me of , and keeps reminding me of each time i smell it again ) . taste ... first thing i said was `` wow . '' powerful and strong on the flavors . not too much alcohol flavor for such a strong brew , but still detectable . chocolate , roasted , sweet malts , toffee , a smidge of smoke , some coffee , prune , and medium hoppiness barrage the tongue with intense flavors . in both the smell and taste i can detect something strangely plastic which is slightly off-putting . i basically deducted a half point in each of those categories because of this . mouthfeel is very thick and rich , smooth but tangy with ample carbonation , bitter at the end but not overly so . a truly thick brew that does n't disappoint in this category . drinkability is low . it 's heavy on the nose , tongue , and stomach , and i certainly could n't drink more than one at a time . in addition , at $ 10 a four-pack , there are better values out there , and i 'll likely not buy this one very often . in fact , the two bottles i have left will probably remain in the fridge for at least a week apiece . might make an interesting black and tan tho . eta : on my second go-round i mixed half of an imperial stout with half a sam adams noble pils . now that 's an interesting black and tan ... i 'll rate it a 4.2 ( arbitrary rating based on hasty generalizations ) ."

S"the body pours a crystal-clear golden yellow , and presents virtually no head , and no lace . the smell is very plain , but there 's a little grain and citrus which is notably pleasant . the taste is far from unique - there 's some malty bitterness , and not much more . you can perhaps taste the citrus that comes through in the aroma , but it 's a stretch . the mouthfeel is again typical of this style , watery and clean . it 's not bad , it 's just plain . it 's something you could drink lots of - a perfect session beer , and a refreshing option for those hot summer days . it 's not something i 'd recommend , but i 'd recommend it over kingfisher and some other like brews ."

S"12oz bottle courtesy of urwithdave ( thanks dave ! ) . a - pours a solid dark brown , with auburn highlights around the edges . maybe a finger or so of off-white head , that fades to a thin cap . just a bit of lacing , and even that slides down the glass quickly . pretty average for the style . s - lots of rich , roasty coffee . a bit of lactose , almost like a milk stout . overall impression is that of a latte . definitely improves as it warms . t - when cold , it 's pretty muted . the coffee notes seem stale and it 's fairly bland . once it gets closer to room temperature , the coffee really comes forward and opens up . that milk stout quality is still there , with a sweetness that compliments the coffee very well . vanilla and milk chocolate are lurking in there somewhere as well . m - thick and creamy , with nice carbonation and viscosity . outstanding . d - i like it , but the coffee flavors are n't quite as nice in the finish . the alcohol , while i ca n't taste it , is there after i 'm done with the bottle . but i 'd still like to have another one . o - very nice beer overall . like i mentioned a couple of times above , it 's a different beer once it warms up . i 'd recommend drinking this one just below room temperature for best results . it 's not quite as good as what i consider the standard-bearer for the coffee stout style , peche mortel ( although i have n't had peruvian morning yet ) , but it 's right up there ."

S"a : very dark brown and opaque . a small brown thick head with good retention leaves a nice lid of foam on top of the liquid . s : a very pleasant smell with lots of aromas of malts with a quite prominent roasted character . a hint of smoke and charcoal . notes of chocolate and chocolate syrup . hints of dark fruits and faint hops . t : the taste starts of nicely with a pleasant sweet flavor of roasted malts , dark chocolate and a note of charcoal . dark bread and wood . muted notes of dark fruits and vanilla . a faint hint of hops . the finish has an aggressive bitterness to it that seems out of tune , and a not so integrated taste of alcohol . notes of chocolate and slightly acidic roasted malts in the finish as well . the finish is actually quite a letdown . m : full-bodied , viscous and creamy . gentle carbonation . d : a good beer with lots of flavors . but there are some flaws in it . most importantly , the finish is quite out of balance , which is a real shame . even though i kind of like it , it 's far from its former glory from the time when christian skovdal andersen ( now beer here ) was the head brewer at lfabrikken ."

S"appearance : light-straw/lemonade-yellow , lots of big bubbles rising , a decent layer of white foam with some lacing aroma : wheat and yeast with a delicate scent of coriander and orange , slightly honied and a bit fruity , a few hops flavor : a very mellow sweetness cut by a tasty wheaty tartness , a nice hint of orange peel and chamomile , finish is dry with a clean aftertaste reminiscent of fresh wort mouthfeel : light , crisp , fluffy , zippy carbonation overall impression : even out of a can , this is a great wit . one of my favorite examples of the style and it seems largely unappreciated . the spice level is balanced , making it deliciously drinkable . i 've been told that the brewing method for this beer is atypical : rather than add the spices to the boil , they are steeped like a tea and added to the wort at bottling ."

S"such a wierd nose . there is a powerful aroma of candy , i 'm thinking kandy korn , which i find totally revolting . but hey , it 's halloween . lots of sticky malt . the hops seem wildly inappropriate . a harsh bitterness on top of a sugary , sweet spice base . not pleasing contrasts like a good sweet and sour duck . i can only think of pumpkin pie made with aspartame -- the artificial sweetner that gave tab that nice bitter taste . here it ai n't nice . this is my second tasting and it only gets worse . my apologies to those who liked it . i give southern tier credit for listing ingredients -- very good for educating us drinkers -- i mean consumers ."

S'appearance - pours a bright , clear amber with a thick 2-inch head . minimal lacing . smell - smokey chipotle dominates . taste - starts out spicy , mellows with a very faint hint of toasty malt before developing much more heat and finishing with an intense , peppery bite . mouthfeel - medium to full-bodied with fine , moderate carbonation . drinkability - too spicy to be sessionable . overall - a cool experiment and definitely something to try , but too overpowering . not something i see myself having again .'

S'pours clear golden in color with an airy white head that practically melts away to nothing . hops really pop on the nose of this one , in addition to a bready aroma . mouthfeel is crisp and sharp . the four style of hops that are utilized are really featured in the flavor of this classic german-styled lager . the hop bitterness hits midway across the tongue and remains throughout the finish . as the beer warms a bit , the malt backbone becomes more prominent . i dropped the drinkability a little , because this just seems to be a filling beer for some reason . otherwise , though , truly an enjoyable german-style pilsner .'

S"call me a naysayer . but my worries started as soon as i saw the 9.1 % abv on the bottle . i 've tried a few of the other polish imports over the last few weeks , and my experience has been that they tend to pack in far more alcohol than the complexities of their beers would warrant . if this was going to be anything like the pilsners i 'd had , 9.1 % was just too much . but i gave it try . poured a nice copper color , with a thin uneven head which soon dissipated to a fine lace top . the aroma is alcohol , a hint of malt , and not much else . the flavor . i tried it cold . i tried it warm . i kept trying it even though each sip made me shudder . earthy and medicinal and intensely alcoholic . like someone crumbled up some hop leaves in rubbing alcohol and served it in a glass . there 's a bit of malt sweetness to it , but even the sweet tastes in this beer manage to come off rather harsh . hugely astringent aftertaste . i 'm a fan of strong beers -- barley wines , stone 's double bastard , you name it . but at least two thirds of this beer went down the drain . i only hope the epa does n't get on my case for polluting the sewers ."

S'as many have said in reviews , keystone is quantity , not quality . ive drank my fair share of keystone through my first year or two of college doing keg stands and getting wasted at parties . my taste has so greatly matured that if i go to a party serving keystone , i tend to bring my own beer . id almost rather not drink at all than drink keystone . if youre looking to get drunk at a cheap price , this does the job . looking for great taste , smell , and quality , keep looking .'

S"a - faintly hazy golden brew with high carbonation and a two finger frothy head with uncanny retention . the lacing is thick and wonderful . for a wheat beer , this is rather impressive . s - slight lemon and grass , but mostly wheat . the grassy smell is slighty unpleasant , but not a major player . t - there is no foretaste , for an instant there is nothing then it immediately switches into a very strong grassy bitterness with a slight honey and citrus backing . as i drank the bitterness became less pronounced , i 'm not sure if i got used to it or if it lessened as it cooled , or some combination thereof . m - thin and very harsh , but quite refreshing . d - eh , it is really bitter for a wheat beer , plus the flavor is n't that great . it is easy to session i suppose , but it really is n't my sort of beer ."

S"i ended up buying a case of this stuff at my local beer store because they were selling the last 4 sixers for $ 3 each . i could n't pass a deal like that up . pours a deep , reddish brown color with a relatively average , light tan head . leaves spotty lacing on the glass , at best . smell is rather strong and of roasted grains , chocolate , and fruit . the taste is a bit off . astringent tastes up-front of raisins , cranberries , and assorted fruits ... roasted chocolately malts in the finish . medium mouthfeel with good carbonation..relatively smooth also . very drinkable and at nearly 7 % abv , this could catch up on you pretty quick . overall , it 's a fall seasonal that 's worth a try , but nothing to get too excited about ."

S"i 'm not that much of a baseball nerd that i can rattle off all that happened in 1955 , but i do know that in 2009 the cubs are tied for first and the nationals have won five in a row . seems a good enough reason to crack open brooklyn 's pennant ale '55 . looks good enough , with a finger-thick head , creamy and long-lasting , sitting on top of a bronze liquid that features thousands of bubbles rushing to the top . nose features that distinctive marris otter smell -- toasty , bready . a distinctive smell that often reminds me of bread pudding . a fruit element comes in , and it 's actually leaning on the sour side . more so than i 'd like and more than expected . bready maltiness abounds , which is good , as it keeps the sourness of the fruit element at bay . this has two months to go before it 's expired , and i doubt brooklyn lacks that kind of quality control that afflicts poorly-made and unintentionally-soured beers . maybe it 's just not what my palate wanted right now . too crisp , too light , and a bit fluffy . not really my kind of mouthfeel , even considering the style . but certainly not atrocious . it is what it is . a good , drinkable , serviceable beer . one i would gladly sip at a baseball game , but probably would n't reach for otherwise ."

S"this is a fabulous beer , i 've never had anything like it . pours a deep dark brown with a tan head that has great head retention . the smell is of deep dark chocolate and raspberry . smell like a nice truffle , hints of caramel and cream . the taste was fabulous , it is like drinking a chocolate covered raspberry , the chocolate upfront taste blends nicely with the raspberry sweetness . the milk/honey blends well with the chocolate . this is medium bodied and goes great with raspberry cheescake or chocolates , great dessert beer . the drinkability is down just because the beer is really sweet , more like a glass a night with dessert than a session beer ."

S"very malty , like british mild malt with just the slightest hint of dark roast malt . some honey aromas and a little fruity . i ca n't find any hops at all . deep brown , held up to the light it 's pretty clear . nice off-white thick and lasting head . it leaves very nice lace as you drink it down . initial hit is roasty dark malt but then it moves to a nice base malt effect . some fermentation esters and a little fruity . hop bitterness is restrained so that it tastes a little sweet but has a bitter kick . there 's some ripe pit fruit fermentation character and an aftertasted of chocolate malt . failry light bodied but cramy on the palate . carbonation level is fairly low which is ok in a british session-type brown ale . it wo n't get raves from people who like big assertive beers , but this is one fantastically balanced english-style brown ale . easy drinking session ale which is pretty much what an english brown is supposed to be . ( it 's hard to put numbers on this since pretty much by definition a brown ale should be `` average '' all around . flavorful enough that you do n't get bored after a couple but non-palate challenging so you could drink it all night . )"

'' has a definite liqueur aftertaste . 2.0 mouthfeel : really syrupy with medium carbonation ( fairly high carbonation for an imperial stout ) . thick body and dry , alcoholic aftertaste . there is really nothing terribly bad about the way it feels in the mouth area of the body . drinkability : ranking this is easy , i have no desire to finish this beer let alone drink another one . in addition with a 10 % alcohol score the ability to drink these is also hindered . wiseman nick says he could finish this one , but he 'd probably feel sick . wiseman justin : 1.0 wiseman nick : 1.5 notes : `` it 's just gross , and it 's just bad ''"

'' m - moderate carbonation , moderate body . d - the sourness of this whiskey barrel aged stout totally ruins this beer . maybe we got a bad bottle . sorry guys , clean your equipment or something . the majority of the reviews are really good . except a couple that have a few low reviews ( that mention the sourness ) . looking at the picture of the brewery might give me an idea why this might have gotten infected . it looks like the unibombers place or something in the back woods ."

S"gorgeous looking brilliant light gold body with lots of fluffy , pillowy foam and excellent retention . immaculate clarity . aroma is a bit unrefined with a definite cooked corn ( dms ) vegetal thing going on amidst some bready malt undertones . it 's odd that sn would let that happen , but the bjcp allows a little bit . no real hop aroma . a bready , malt-forward , easy-drinking bock with only a touch of hops to balance . the cooked corn is still present but not overly offensive . some light toasty melanoidin character . a dry pilsner sweetness on the finish . peppery hop character . what i love about this beer is the subtle alcohol warmth that creeps up as you quickly make your way through such a drinkable beer . i 'm afraid many of the negative commentors are n't privy to what makes a good helles bock . there is n't much hop character because there should n't be . this beer is everything it should be , except for being a little heavy on the dms . otherwise , clean , smooth , highly quaffable , well-constructed ."

S"i saw this on the shelf at total wine in sarasota and had to try one of the few major releases from victory that i had n't yet . a : poured into a standard pint glass , small tight head that does n't stick around . really cool ruby/brownish color with great highlights . s : smell is pretty hop forward with some dry fruit maybe . a little sweetness in there too . i 'm getting over a cold , so i may have to revisit that when i 'm feeling 100 % . t : sweet up front with a lot of malty , carmel notes and a pretty big hop-bitterness . however , the bitterness lingers a bit too long and too bitter for my liking . the longer i work on each sip , the less i want to take another due to the bitterness at the back of my mouth . if not for this , it would have scored much higher . m : mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing . judging on this alone , i 'm surprised at the high alcohol content . d : besides the longstanding bitterness i was getting on the finish , i 'd love this beer . however , the unpleasant aftertaste is probably going to make this a one-and-done selection for me . victory is a killer brewery and everything they make is worth drinking . this one may just be a matter of my own personal preference , but i 'll stick to hopdevil if i 'm looking for bitterness ."

S"this brew was purchased on a business trip to las vegas , mainly because i have n't seen it in my area for many years . an interesting souvenir , but i got gouged at $ 3.75 for one can . it was a yellow , clear beer with a good head , but it dissipated really fast . not surprising . the aroma practically screamed grains , and it was slightly skunky . a trace of hop aroma came through though . the taste was not even there , however . there was a very weak bitterness , but otherwise it was soda water . and not very fizzy soda water either . drinkable ? hell yes , i could pound down six of these like they were ginger ale , and probably feel as much of a buzz ."

S"light straw yellow in color , no head . faintly malty nose with distance hints of grassy hops . sadly , this beer reminds me of a budweiser . slightly malty , weak grassy hops , super thin mouthfeel , and was n't refreshing in the least bit . i think i 'd rather drink a coke than this beer ."

S"poured from bottle in to standard pint . yellow in color champagne like carbonation dances up from base . smells like sweet malty goodness not bad . taste is a little on the light side of things but no complaints . overly carbonated in the mouth almost like a sprite that has been in the hot truck allday ( i know that 's a bad comparison as the sprite would be flat as hell but it feels about the same on the tounge ) . highly drinkable despite its poor mouthfeel . i must say far better than any bmc out there ."

S"bottle sent to me by badnewsbeers . poured into darkness snifter . a - pitch black pour with very little head . s - smoke , light caramel sweetness . some booze , but not as much as i 'd expect from 18 % beer . t - large dark fruit sweetness . chocolate . smokey finish . again i do n't get as much booze as i 'd expect . i can feel it down my throat more than i can taste it . m - super thick . very little carbonation . somewhat of a dry finish . overall - i get the impression that kuhnhenn , following the trend with ris , brewed the biggest baddest beer they could . low carbonation is this beers fault , but other than that it is very impressive how high they got the abv with how little it shows through . very impressive that its 5 % points higher than dl '09 with less booze flavor ."

S"paid $ 11.99 for a 500ml bottle from healthy spirits in san francisco , ca . poured into my chimay chalice . i can see looking at the bottle that this is like one of those glass balls you shake up and the snow falls everywhere inside . the sediment floats freely in this brew and is of a rather large size . i 'll pour slowly ... still leaves a massive inch and a quarter very white head . quite frothy towards the top , larger-sized , fizzy bubbles towards the bottom . excellent retention and lacing . very well carbonated . those large sediment particles still quite visible . cloudy , straw/gold color . smells much more like a belgian blonde than an ipa . spice , yeast , breadiness . slight banana and citrus backing . i was expecting much more hop character . clean and pale . where are the hops in this one ? taste is similar in characteristic to the nose . this one certainly gets better as it warms . the mouth is the beer 's best attribute . quite drinkable and smooth going down . medium bodied . quite carbonated , but certainly not overboard . i 'm not a huge belgian blonde fan ; i got this hoping it was more hoppy . the low ranks for smell and taste are more due to this being advertised as 'hoppy ' and this not really being the case . the green flash le freak is more up my alley for this style as you can actually taste the hops ."

( pts off ) taste was good tad watery though - roasted malts coffee cocoa mouthfeel is just too thin drinkability is good because its so light a solid effort from ab and might get bmc drinkers to develop a taste for craft beers'

S"dark color . darkest barleywine i 've ever seen . not much carbonation nor head . the smell is malt thick . it 's like the smell of malt extract used in the quick homebrewing recipes . i guess that is how a dense malt syrup should smell . somehow the taste comes through to be more complex . it is definitely malt heavy ( i may have got an old one ) . i do n't really sense much hops at all . the taste also adds some smokey flavors . it 's almost like it has been aged in burnt barrels , but it 's not advertised that way and does n't taste like bourbon at all . the beer has a nice aftertaste but it is too sweet to drink more than half a bottle . interesting barleywine , with emphasis on the barley , but i like a stronger hop influence ."

S"hand pumped and carefully poured into my gold rimmed pint glass at romans . the beer is dark brown almost black in color . the mocha hued head stands a solid two fingers and has great retention . gobs of lace are left coating my glass . the aroma is light coffee with hints of chocolate , vanilla , roast malt and hops . the flavor is smooth roast malt , coffee , chocolate and lots of bitter hops to give it that porter bite . medium to full creamy body . no carbonation , not that i would expect any in cask beer . overall i took about four gulps and the beer was gone . to say it 's drinkable is an understatement . awesome beer ."

S"review from notes taken on 11/20/10 . the label is different from what is listed but i 'm assuming this is the same brew . no indication on the bottle that the base brew is jai alai but this is the only listing for a cedar aged ipa so it 's probably the same . poured into a snifter this brew appears a beautiful perfectly clear light orange color with 2 fingers of fluffy yellowish stained , creamy head . it retains well and leaves a leggy pattern of lace around the glass . the aroma of this brew is sweet floral hops mixed with some light indications of vanilla . some citrus , pine and spicy character is evident . a light tingle of the alcohol is felt in the nose through the back along with a seemingly candy sugary sweetness . the taste is herbal hops mixed with a woodsy flavor that unsurprisingly tastes like cedar with some spiciness . some oily bitterness clings with some resine like orange rind . a light toasted grain sweetness balances out the flavor of the hops and cedar . this is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation . the alcohol is noticeable with a bit of a perfume-like flavor and warmth . the hops last inside the mouth long after each sip . this would be a well balanced brew except the cedar flavor really stood out and sort of clashed a bit . nonetheless it was an interesting experience and i would drink it again but maybe with a different take on the hops or with a less aggressive cedar flavor ."

S'draught at the bistro ipa fest . clear straw with a sticky head . huge fruity aroma with grapefruit , mangos and peaches . soft and rounded with lots of fruit in the flavor . dry and light in the malt department , with a light body . the flavor is almost pure fruity hops , with no harshness or obtrusive bitterness . not really like their other ipas , and maybe only similar to sculpin in its profile . the spec sheet said 72 ibus , but the bitterness is so smooth that you hardly even notice it . the amarillo hops add a really nice dimension to the aroma , with the mango and peach components coming through over the more citric notes you might expect from the cascade and centennial that are also used . definitely another standout addition to the rr ipa lineup , and a unique one . probably tied with kern river for the best ipa of the festival .'

S'a - very light and very carbonated . not your typical ipa s - smelled like a citrusy pale ale t - has a very light and refreshing taste . this is a very good pale ale not sure why they consider this an ipa . tastes a lot like it smells . m - very thin bodied and over-carbonated . d - based on style i would say drinkability is very low . this tastes exactly like a couple of pale ales that i have had . if this were called an extra pale ale this would get a much score . long hammer is by no means a bad beer , in fact it is quite the opposite . the reason for the low score is in the fact that red hook decided to name it an ipa . call it a pale and it would get way higher reviews ...'

S'im a big fan of samuel adams beer and will always give anything the comes out of their breweries a try . im partial to the darker brews but with spring on the horizon i figured id give the white ale a whirl . i drank this beer from the bottle as well as poured into a glass with reasonably the same result , a pretty darn good thirst quenching beer ! now im not a big fan of these types of beers but the taste was not flowery or overwelming like many comparable brews . there was little head on this beer when poured into a glass , and the head that was there did not last long and there was a fair bit of lacing , not too much but some . it poured a predictable cloudy golden color . the drinkiability of this beer is its strong suit , this would be a great beer on a late spring or early to mid summer day . all in all this beer is another great beer from the people at sam adams and the boston brewery and its definately worth a try .'

S'first off , i have to admit i had long ago dismissed this beer as yet another macro with a british accent . when a friend handed me a bottle this weekend , though , i was reminded that this really is not a bad beer at all . typical pale-ale amber color with a billowy white head . slightly herbal hop aroma , a bit tangy , with a barely-perceptible malty sweetness . starts with a tangy , almost metallic taste that gives way to a barely noticeable sweetness . finish is pleasantly bitter . overall , more balanced than i recall , and not a bad example of the style .'

S"enjoyed during a tasting with tlay10 . this one was poured from the bottle into a snifter . the head is a two-finger dark ginger-colored glob of pancake batter , very tightly packed . it recedes at a snail 's pace , becoming half a finger in height before halting its retreat completely . the beer itself is black , sucking in all light . snaking horizontal lines of lace decorate the glass in sticky streaks as i drink . in the nose : bourbon , maple , graham cracker , vanilla , a bit of bright green oak . there 's not a ton of fruitiness , though i do pick up some amaretto cherries . there 's also a lot of bourbon in here , imparting heavy vanilla with smooth integration . while the nose was fairly well-balanced , the flavor has let the bourbon run rough-shod over the other flavors . this tastes like straight liquor without the burn . as it warms , other tastes start to emerge : molasses , black malt , vodka , perhaps some cinnamon , cigarette ash , a tiny bit of fruit tang . it 's not bad ; just off-balance . the carbonation is a prickly medium and fairly fizzy . the body is cream and moderately full , but the fizziness and alcohol are a little distracting . black ops drinks like booze . it 's heavy and uncomplicated -- a lot of bourbon with a little bit of beer . it improves impressively as it warms , but never reaches the smoothness or balance you 'd expect from a $ 20+ bottle of beer ."

S"served in a snifter , my first taste of this famous and infamous brew . a : a dark copper-orange color , which is quite pretty . no head to speak of , naturally . s : interestingly , when i smelled first out of the bottle , i smelled only hops , and i was really excited . when i poured into the snifter , it really came alive , and not entirely in a better way . some very strong paint-thinner edge , which is essentially the primary aroma . t : extremely sweet up front , tastes an orange-lemon-hop syrupy extract . it is a little bitter on the finish , but no nearly enough to balance the crazy sweetness . i do like some things about it though , and the taste is definitely more agreeable than the aroma to me , as the paint-thinner parts were able to translate to non-paint-thinner flavors . m : extraordinarily slick and syrupy , yet i would n't say it is undercarbonated at all . in fact considering what the 21 % abv might predict in regards to carbonation i 'd say the carb levels are much higher than expected , and i think that is important and helps the beer a great deal . d : drinkability is probably the most subjective category , because there is n't really a good definition to go off of in the first place . can i drink it ? definitely , it tastes good and i paid a premium for it . can i ( or anyone really ) have more than one ? very unlikely , not to mention i paid a premium for it . but considering the extremity of the beer , i think drinkability is average . a very interesting beer . if i did n't dislike the aroma so much , i think i really would have liked it . maybe next time i 'll leave it in the bottle ; )"

S"12 oz. , bottled during the second week of november . it pours quite black with a thin , dark khaki head which swiftly forms a small collar before eventually reducing to nothing . rich coffee and roasted malts in the nose at first , but soon an imposing sourness shows up . on the palate there is strong coffee with roasted/burnt malts , along with some sweetness , yeast , lactose ? , and a distracting sour character . the body is drying , light/medium with comparable carbonation , and it leaves a medium finish . overall it seems a little out-of-whack - not sure if the sourness is intentional or if this beer oxidized too quickly ; and the coffee did n't meld well with the lactic/sour quality . a disappointment , but luckily i 've got a java stout waiting for comparison ."

S"my thanks to jocelyn for the sample . 12oz capped bottle . a : pours out a full copper-toned mahogany with not much of a head to speak of . gorgeous in colour . it does retain some bubbly thick mist and a decent r.a.t.r . n : strong aromas of caramel creme candies , brown sugar , rum cake , and maybe a touch of belgian brown influence . sweet and quite pleasant . p/m : emptiness . why do many of these sam brews always to lead me to the edge and then offer me nothing but a void ? mere hints and suggestions of what was offered up in the nose overrun by light sour malt and strong carbonation and carbonated water . a touch of sweet caramel is there , yes , but is very light and fades away almost immediately . not much here to reccomend it palate-wise . carbonation is not as strong and overpowering as it was with the 375 , but it 's very bubbly nonetheless and that contributes greatly to the problem . medium bodied , but rather thin and watery throughout . the finish is both clean and sour , leaving a long sour wake as it fades away from your short term memory . notes : you might as well either go for a brooklyn brown for the same price or some simple carbonated water ( gerolsteiner and perrier are two fine ones for starters ) . this may be better when sampled fresher , but really , now , with a brown ale that should n't be too determining a factor , should it ? yet another sam adams brew i 'm not going to bother with again ."

S"-- -taken from notes -- - had this one on tap at delaney 's tap room in new haven ct . if you 're in the area it 's worth a bit of a drive from the awful ( excepting bru rm ) establishments downtown . anyway , this beer was , well , not of my favorite style . very sour , unlike anything i 've had ( including other flemish reds ) . a bit of a fruit flavow , alcohol came through a bit stronger just because of the acidity . little carbonation or head , i imagine because of the acid . did i mention it 's sour ? !"

S'gabf blue ribbon winner . dark shadowy mahogany clear topped with a settled khaki wafer thin head cap . ( possibly high abv equates the thin head ) toostie roll and smoked peat moss scottish scents . first swigs : rude bold unbridled tootsie-roll and cocoa . toasted malt & syrupy . smokey peat with a hint of cherry . lingering candi sugar toffee and even a yogurt like finish . last swigs : makes me wonder if the house yeast here is a scottish ale yeast ? cocoa and peat .'

S"a : poured into snifter from growler . pale amber colour , thin bubbly head . center of the head fades quickly while a bubbly ring is left . s : not too many strong aromas . hops , mainly and some sweetness that you find in many belgian tripels . t : initial is a burst of flavour including malts , slight hops , some sweet honey-like flavour . downside is that it does n't last very long . aftertaste is almost non-existent . m : medium-bodied , smooth , almost creamy . d : goes down very easy , barely any alcohol presence . not a bad beer but there are triples out there far better ."

S'having recently attended the belgian beer fest i thought it was time i opened the orval i had sitting in my cellar for the past year and a half . the beer pours a slightly hazy copper color with a thick white frothy head on top . the fruity esters combine with hints of orange peel , all spice , and sour apple to create a complex aroma . each sip of this medium bodied beer is dry with a fizzy tingle on the palate , like champagne . the flavor is a blend of dry malt , citrus ( orange and lemon ) , spice ( allspice ? ) and grapes . it sort of reminds me of a white wine . it finishes with a slightly sour taste . orval is a full flavored somewhat complex beer . flavors seem to grow as the beer warms .'

S"on draft at churchkey in d.c. a : this beer appears a very clear , light golden color . the head is very minimal , yet the retention is very good . s : the beer smells really funky and tannic , always a good sign . t : the taste is reminiscent of sour white wine , with a really puckering finish . i also get some nice notes of wood with prominent acetic properties . m : the feel is decent , with a growing vinegar burn in the back . d : it 's pretty tasty , but not the smoothest ride ."

S"a 12 oz . bottle , familiarly wrapped with red foil crown . have had plenty of saisons before , but this is probably my first dubbed 'imperial ' . poured to a pint glass , many thanks to ba badbeer for this one . a : very deep golden , a murkier amber-tinged glow . translucent , with an ultra-fine silty haze and plenty of carbonation . starts with a 3-finger head of fizzy-but-tight eggshell , falls to an even denser half-finger of foam . s : musty grain aroma , this is straight-up barnyard/hay . it 's not particularly nostril-tickling tart or sour , but there 's a beyond-lemon twinge , melded with cut grass and a sweetened spice . pretty typical and a little mild for me , but good-smelling nonetheless . t : 'yeast roll ' with a lemon-butter tart essence . tartness and dryness really roll forward with each subsequent sip , lasting spice hangs in the finish . apples , tart & green , and dried apricots fill the 'fruit ' profile here , tangy and spicy all at once . dry and peppery in the end . m : extra weight can be felt , a woodier thickness that sits a little heavily on the tongue . some pronounced cheek warmth , too , and a mellow carbonation . d : enjoyable sipper , but too heavy for more than one . the pleasures of the saison style are in it 's crispness/lightness in drinkability ; an 'imperial ' version suffers because of a seemingly unneeded alcohol boost . worthy of tryin , just know that i prefer the 'regular ' ol ' saisons better ."

S"purchased a month or two ago- time to crack it open to see if it 's worth picking up more before it 's impossible to find . appearance- is a very very pale amber . really it 's more yellow , so the classification right from the bat is questionable , as expected with this being a very experimental beer . small white head with some lacing . bottle-conditioned . smell- fruity esters abound interlaced with a solid sweetness from the rice and pilsner malt . faint hops in the background and sake-like alcohol attempting to move closer to the forefront . taste- very interesting , and perhaps better than you would think based on the smell . on the sweeter side of things , but overall a nice refreshing balance with just a kiss of hallertauer hops . honey , earthy , rice , hint of banana , slightly herbal . pretty darn complex when you take some time to savor it . mouthfeel- mediumish body with lots of malt present . nearly creamy . pretty nice carbonation with tiny bubbles delivering a slight and constant tingle . a lingering sweetness , but also a slight lingering hop bitterness which is pretty much the only point where you can taste the hallertauer . drinkability & final thoughts- while i did enjoy this brew , it 's not something i want a whole lot more of . it did provide an interesting a new drinking experience , which is what i think the purpose was ... truly a style-bending beer that highlights the creativity found in american craft beer these days . as for classification i 'd say this is 70 % japanese rice lager , 20 % american amber , and 10 % sake ."

S"first-time reviewer , long-time drinker . okay ... go ! served on draft into a pint glass at the lancaster brewery . a - pours a very thin head that dissipates quickly . dark amber/gold in color . s - hops and barley as far as the nose can smell . citrus on the orange side as well as some lemon . t - intense . strong hop flavor right off the bat that somewhat attacks the tongue and leaves a sting of bitterness . a pleasant sting , but rough nontheless . d - a bit too much to have more than one , as the 10 % abv and the hoppy flavor comes on strong enough . a good beer to close with but more than one may kill your taste buds for following it with something else . overall - sip it and savor it well if you 're a fan of the style , but it 's a difficult act to follow with the job it does on your palate ."

S'the bigfoot ale takes a close second to celebration ale when ranking sierra nevada brews . the 2006 vintage poured to a dark brown cloudy liquid . nominal head that did last down to the bottom of the glass . nice fine lacing . the smell was of hoppy alcohol , and fruits . very nice ! taste was of a great blend of strong malt and hops . strong alcohol kicker as well . again very nice . the brew felt thick with little carbonation . despite the heaviness and alchohol content of this beer i found it extremely drinkable . another solid product by sn .'

S"clear bottle poured into a pint glass . i 've been saving this random find hoping i could compare it to a bud select 55 but nobody seems to be offering me one . pours a pale straw with a light white head as expected . not much carbonation though , hmmmm . gets rather flat in short order , yet not a beer i assume the manufacturer expects to be put in a glass.. nose is oddly rich in grain . not triple hopped like miller light by any means . in fact there are no hops , as expected . an oddly sweet grain aroma for such a diminutive beer . taste follows with light grain initially , becoming a vacuous void after just a second or so as the dryness of the beverage becomes apparent . grainy in feel helps make this beer somewhat drinkable and much better from a glass than my one prior experience directly from a can . touch of lemon on the finish . better than the masses say , yet what 's the point ? ?"

S"much to my dismay when i ventured to my beer fridge to grab a coldy it was fully stocked , unfortunately none of the beers i would consider sessionable . not in the mood to drive i walked to the corner store and picked up some mgd . i certainlly wo n't turn my nose up to macro 's , good sunday sports type of brew to me . yeah the adjuncts get annoying but the thirst quenching , flavorless brew actually works in my book . mgd is a shade darker than its competition . carbonation will grab your attention as its almost champagne like on the initial pour . decent head fades rapidly w/ trace lacing . kinda sweet , and as it warms it gets a sugary syrup texture , by all means drink it ice cold ."

S'wow.. definately dark and thick . i would compare the thickness to that of tomato juice . it clings to the sides of the glass . the head comes from the bottom , and never gets very big at all . if anything , it looks as if there might be a small oil slick on top of the beer . aroma is that of fresh dark roasted coffee . my girlfriend could smell it from 3 feet away . the taste kept reminding me of chocolate covered cherries , until near the end which it switched to heavy roasted grain flavor . mouthfeel is thick and viscous . my only fault with this beer is the fact it is far too intense to enjoy the full bottle by yourself .'

S"delicious , absolutely delicious ! 2006 vintage . it 's had a year to morph . an interesting color , lighter than i would have expected for a winter ale , especially one of this color , a deep pale . picture perfect head . with the typically large bubbles of a de dolle brew . nose is like a barley wine . an aggressive burst of malt and hops . smells like a beer cologne . the tastes differ from the nose , which is more herbal and choc full of alcohol aromas . tastes ... like warm apple pie . it really does . warm alcohol with spice and apple notes . fall flavors , a little off for a `` winter beer '' but absolutely delicious none the less . could n't put this one down . i usually do n't like sweet/fruity beers , but this one had enough body , alcohol and hop bite to make it worth my time and money . thick and hearty , but a bit to astringent in the mouth . it coats the mouth like other de dolles , but not as much as other beers with such a high abv ( and 12 is about as high as it gets ! ) entirely drinkable for a beer of this strength , but it is one that demands sipping . i defy any one to drink this in under 20 minutes . in fact i took almost a half hour , and i 'm sure the spelling and punctuation mistakes are evident in this review ... ."

S"the most important thing to note is that they have clearly changed the recipe since last year 's debut ( and , obviously , the name ) . it is now `` full moon . '' in fact , i ca n't help but wonder if perhaps the new version deserves to be entered in the database as a new beer . the most common thread i see in reviews from last year 's version is a strong presence of imitation vanilla . there is nothing like that in this year 's version , thank god . so whatever this is , it 's better than a fake vanilla beer . sadly it was a bit of a disappointment . i got excited when i bought it because the label claims it is `` an abbey ale brewed with a hint of dark belgian sugar . '' which , not surprisingly , made me think this was a belgian abbey ale . ca n't imagine where i got that idea from . unfortunately , it is clearly not fermented with belgian abbey yeast . it does n't have any of the spiciness or complexity that would be bestowed by the use of such a yeast . instead , i 'm tasting standard american amber sort of flavors here . it 's malty and it 's a nice basic amber colored ale , but it 's no belgian beer by a long shot . what a shame . i can not begin to imagine why coors did n't just ferment this guy with belgian yeast . why the hell not ? it could n't possibly have increased the cost much , if at all . that certainly would have lended this a much more authentic character . instead we get a basic american ale masquerading as a belgian . sigh ."

S"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass pours a very light brown ( for a scotch ale ) , medium beige head , big fat carbonation . smells very smokey and sweet . taste is extremely smokey with a sort of caramel sweetness behind it . there 's an odd sourness in the background that makes my jaw clench a little ( not in an unpleasant way ) . the alcohol is evident in the aftertaste . mouthfeel is light but filmy , very carbonated and effervescent . fairly drinkable , but the sweetness would get to me after a while ."

S"pours a darker cloudy brown with copper ruby hues . it looks lighter in color than most brown ales . a small off white head dissipates and leaves some slight lace . smell is mainly malt with some caramel sweetness . taste is interesting and pleasing . up front there is a crispness from slight carbonation that leaves sweetness from the malt . caramel flavors are more abundant than any brown ale i 've had before . earthy hop flavors underly the finish and allow the beer to be pretty unique and flavorful . brown ales never really explode with flavor , but this one shines in an understated maturity of flavor ."

S'best by date of august 2008 , sampled february 2007 labled a stout , but really pours more like a dark brown ale , or really a porter . this beer is topped by a frothy , initially two-finger thick , amber tinged tan colored head . the beer sits a deep , dark brown color in my glass and shows ruby highlights when held up to the lamp . the aroma is a mix of concentrated fruit notes like raisin and fig , as well as a sort of cheesy note , and some definite notes of madeira and sherry . the lasts too really become noticeable as you dig around in the aroma . there is a nice spiciness to the aroma as well , with notes of clove leading the way , but also notes of ginger , a touch of anise , and even some fenugreek . there is definitely something cheesy going on here though . up front the beer tastes of raisins and prunes , as it moves back off the tongue a lightly tart note becomes noticeable . in the long finish a note similar to port , and perhaps even a touch of sherry is noticeable . very little roast character is noticeable , which is not entirely unexpected in this belgian brewed beer . the beer just does not do it for me , it tastes a bit too much like fermented prune juice to really be all that palatable . it never reaches horrible , and i could easily drink this if politeness demanded it . fortunately it does not , so i will not .'

S"dark black beer in the snifter glass with a mocha head that clings around the edges but does n't keep for very long . pouring this beer is a very pretty sight as it has a nice redish black color as it comes out of the bottle before it hits the glass . the bourbon barrel aroma is apperent in the nose . i also noticed some dark chocolate aromas , and a bit of booziness . all the `` dark '' aromas are here . not a lot of strength of the aroma and i would n't put it as one of the highlights of the beer . taste is excellent . i may have had or will have had better tasting imperial stouts but this is clearly something special . a nice chocolate sweetness is on the front of the tongue , and the bourbon hits somewhere in the middle . i do n't love the taste of bourbon , and i do n't go crazy over beers that are bourbon aged , but this is done just right in a way that adds to the beer . mouthfeel is a highlight of this brew . very smooth , from fridge temp to nearly room temp . great lingering aftertaste that is perfect for a sipper . i had a good time sipping on this beer . there is a bit of a burn on it and towards the end of the 22oz it becomes a very slow sipper . aging notes from `` black friday '' stout tasting 2009 , 2007-2009 vintages : the aroma changes in this beer considerably , with the two year old bottle ( 2007 ) smelling the best . with time , this beer looses some hops but never completley , and the chocolate aroma just gets better every year . after one year ( 2008 ) , the chocolate mends with barrel and hop aromas to create an interesting balance . after two years ( 2007 ) , this aroma is like a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting . that balance is just gone and this is pure fudgy chocolate . there is also a great , ale like dark fruitiness that is n't found in the other bottles . the flavor swings in balance in a similar way the aroma does . the barell flavors fade , making this a better beer if your not a fan of bourbon . i think the barell flavors are actually most noticeable after one year , and then fade away after two . the chocolate flavors get better , and the bitterness from both the hops and roast get softer . the licorice flavor adds a nice dimension , and is more noticeable with time because of the overall softening of harsh flavors . the mouthfeel seems to thin out in the 2007 bottle . excellent beer for aging . i took extensive notes on this beer and its changes , so these"

S"22oz - bright copper ale with a wash of frothy head . nose is not in your face hops , but the hop bouquet is quite fresh and extremely herbacious ( dank-style ) , grassy and reminscent of walking through the woods after it 's rained . very nice . flavor is quite balanced throughout , showing off some toffee notes and grapefruit , before melting into an herbal , dry hoppy finish . the bitterness is nowhere near powerful yet it lingers long after . a bubblegum sweetness mellows on the tongue . as has been said , carbonation is `` mild '' ..i wo n't say `` low '' here because it is certainly enough to meet where i think it should be within the style ... so we 'll say `` moderate . '' it 's nice though . really quite the interesting hop profile . remember kids , this is n't an ipa . yes , the label says `` hop trip '' , but this is n't an all-out hop-orgasm to destroy your palate . this is an extremely smooth , balanced apa with a very unique and tasty hop thang going on . certainly worth a try , and quite sessionable ."

S"one of those beers i got interested in through ba . sadly , i must report i do n't think it lives up to the hype . a-more yellow than golden , very bubbly , even 10 minutes after pour s-all i get is faint orangey/lemony smell tinged with iron t-meh ... .taste like iron with a modest belgian sweetness . i 'd rather have the waffle . surprisingly not astringent or alcoholy . similiar in taste to a sparking white grape juice . d- i must give praise on this category . for a 9 % beer , it 's one of the smoothest and easiest to drink i 've had . take that miller or coors light . in closing , i give this a whopping meh . i think trader joe 's vintage '07 beats the shit out of this beer , and costs less . it 's so bubbly , you almost think this is more a mid-morning than evening drink . when i crave something bubbly and sweet , i 'm almost more tempted just to buy some sparkling cider , which is basically in the same genus as this beer . this is a pretentious beer and i 'm not impressed . what more can i say ? i 'll drink it again , but i wo n't buy it again ."

S'2000 vintage pouring like motor oil , the color is an opaque black with copper highlights and absolutely no head whatsoever . the sweet aroma features a deep roastiness with dark fruit notes , and dark chocolate . the flavor of this beer is very similar to the nose and includes a heavy , multi-layered roastiness ( chocolate , bitter coffee , etc . ) , various dark fruit flavors with plum and sugary raisins being the most notable , and a touch of hop bitterness thrown in there . there is also a fairly distinct oakiness , sipping this beer reminds me of drinking an earthy red wine . the mouthfeel is thick with no detectable carbonation . lovers of red wine will appreciate this one : its very oaky with no carbonation . add that to a viscous , oily texture and youll quickly realize that imperial extra double is putting it mildly . not the best imperial stout ive ever had , but certainly the thickest . recommended .'

S"pours out with a beautiful golden-orange color . minimal head , but i would n't expect much of a head from a mead based brew . noticeably warm on the nose , and very sweet . you can definitely pull the honey out on the first sniff , but the pear adds a dynamic that i do n't see in many beers . the rear of the aroma becomes almost flowery . very sweet on the tongue . normally i 'll hold this quality against a beer , but widmer brothers found a way to make it work . the honey is almost overbearing , but only almost . malt shines through nicely . i occasionally catch a bit of spice like one would expect from a wheat beer , but this is fleeting and definitively not a primary characteristic . if you enjoy smoked white wines , you are going to absolutely love the mouth-feel . reminiscent of an aussie chardonnay . everything about this beer screams , `` age me ! '' it has plenty of gravity and sugar to work with and the foundations are strong enough to last for some time . if you 're going to try this at all , buy two and put one away for 9-14 months . glad i tried it ; would definitely recommend to a friend ."

S'served to my self a little warm . oops . had just put it in the fridge and became impatient . straw to yellow appearance , very clear , very still . large fluffy head that drops to less than a quarter inch after a couple minutes . smell is like the mist from an orange being peeled . sweet lemon spray too . delightful . taste is of coriander , sweet orange , and pale stuff . absolutely no off flavors , fully refreshing and delicious . low carbonation , medium body , quite pleasant . looks can be deceiving as the mouthfeel is pretty substantial . i cant wait for summer . i can picture my self relaxing on my porch with a six pack of these , not wanting to be anywhere else .'

S"this abomination was of course provided by alex . bottle poured into a perfect pint glass ... a dark clear reddish copper with a huge off white head , good retention ... the aroma is beyond horrendous a true 1 . smells like turpentine mixed with burnt rubber , amazingly you do get the steroids hops on this finish . it makes me gag ... the taste is equally impressively bad . i have one sip at first , then literally have to talk myself into a second and third so i can get an accurate tick . the taste again is fuesal alcohol , paint thinner , and burnt rubber mixed together in a perfect bouquet . bitter 1000 ibu hops are present and almost help the taste a little , as the feel almost numbs you . this is probably the worst craft beer i 've had . i would avoid this at all costs unless you are a sadist ."

S"from bottle to wine glass , poured side by side with `` either . '' `` or '' is part 2 of 2 in the collaboration between cigar city , grassroots brewing ( denmark ) & hill farmstead . both beers are brewed at ccb . $ 10.75 for the 12oz bottle . a : half of a finger of medium-dark brown head is produced on the pour and fizzes out rather quickly . the body is the darkest brown imaginable with tawny tints along the top edges of the glass . moderate lacing . s : or is the older brother to either , it 's more heavily roasted , has a noticeably bigger hop bill and a stronger presence of spanish cedar . heavily malted with notes of molasses and pumpernickel bread . the hop bill is enormous with a fresh pine wood scent mixed in with other citrusy notes . it seems that , what would normally be considered huge hop aromas , are actually just big hop aromas that are being elevated by the toasted spanish cedar , something that cigar city does very well . the more assertive hop , cedar and alcohol in or combine to form an even stronger acetone character than was in either . newer leather and danker earth in part 2 . t : from nose to mouth , or is relatively consistent . the cedar and hops remain at the front while not exactly pushing the malts out of the way . flavors of tar and sasparilla add to the appeal . the monstrous abv is integrated rather than concealed . general sweetness is evident , but i think it is more of a result of the fermentable sugars than the ty ty honey* which , in my mind , has a greater impact on the mouthfeel than anything else . m : or is more abrasive than it 's counterpart , partly due to it 's livlier , fizzier effervescence . the body is medium full , slick and sticky . a big hop bitterness comes through at the finish which is more than likely accentuated by the dryness that the honey provides . d : above average drinkability , all things considered . an inventive , very bold and assertive brew with an addictive nose and great flavor . i did n't have any trouble finishing the 24 ounce side by side for comparison 's sake . both beers are fantastic , but i think or is the better beer . *ty ty honey comes from a native american chestnut tree that is said to produce large , honey sweet kernels of unparalleled taste and quality ."

S"appearance : dark amber color with a tannish/offwhite head . the head was abundant , exploding into the glass and settled to about 1/2 finger thickness , never getting smaller . smell : a mix of malty goodness , some light hoppage , and poorly made gravy ... gravy ? yes gravy . it took over the taste at times , but at others it was n't very apparent . i thought it might be the glass , so i switched glasses . i thought it might be where i was drinking it , so i moved outside . the gravy followed . taste : the gravy from the smell came back to the taste too . this time however , there was a nice intense hop taste . more intense than i expected for a bock , but still german tasting . mouthfeel : the beer had a great alcoholic zing to it , and the body was perfect for a bock : not to heavy , not to light , somewhere in the middle and smooth . however , it was interrupted by overcarbonation that never ceased . the bubbles were a nuisance to a nice mouthfeel . drinkability : despite the poor taste and the awkward mouthfeel , it was actually pretty easy to down . i would n't want it again , but there are other bocks that just do n't sit as well flowing down the palate ."

S"22oz bomber with no dating information . clearly the 2008 model , though , as the label is new this year . the label proudly proclaims a grassy flavor . not something i expected to be a selling but , we will see . poured into a snifter , this beer is a crystal clear amber with a foamy white head . there are n't very many bubbles rising so the head fades relatively quickly . the beer did maintain a nice film of head throughout , though . the aroma is filled with citrusy hops followed by just a touch of nutty malt . when i agitate the beer a bit i can detect a trace of coffee aroma as well . there is a bit of `` grassy '' aroma here , though i think it smells more like crushed leaves . the wet hops are very evident in the flavor . there is a strong up-front bitterness that fades into a fairly robust malt flavor . this trails off into a vegetal flavor that is pretty unique to wet hop beers . there is some grassy character , but also something like leaves in the fall . there is definitely more malt flavor here than i was expecting , but it is very well balanced between the hop bitterness , malt , and hop grassiness . the flavors complement each other well . this beer has a nice medium body and a relatively dry , tart finish . the flavor of this beer is unique and a little inappropriate for sessioning . 22oz of this is probably enough for the whole year actually . i great beer that has its place , but not one i will be coming back to soon ."

S"as per the directions on the bottle , i poured this extremely nice beer quite unhurriedly into an oversized wine glass . i was able to produce a fairly good pour with a strong head . the head was gorgeous and had amazing retention . the lacing , according to another who was watching , was `` breathtaking . '' the smell was incredible ( to me , it was even better than the taste ) and oh-so inviting . i was almost nervous taking the first sip . it felt quite thick in my mouth , and it seemed to open up when rolled around and chewed in the mouth . there is a distinct alcohol flavor in the brew , which i would attribute to duvel 's relatively high abv ( 8.5 % ) . definitely not a session beer , but an excellent beer to start a session with . drinking one of these was enough for me , as i know repeated consumption in the same night would result in less appreciation for such a fine product ."

S"poured from a bottle into a sierra nevada pint glass . three fingers of tan foam kept me from adding the whole 12 oz . to prevent overflow . the beer is an opaque brown with red and orange hues . the head settled immediately to a film and left lacing . smells of dark fruit , sour cherries and booze . the first taste lets you know you 're in for a boozy ride , yet it 's quite smooth . there are loads and loads of sweet malts that balance the alcohol or perhaps it 's the other way around . it warms the belly all the way down . sour cherries are trying to hide , but as the ale warms they are revealed . as far as i remember this is my first quad , and frankly my palate is having a little trouble relishing the super sweet malts and high alcohol . it 's not off putting by any means , just something strong and different . the mouth feel is rich and kinda thick yet carbonated , a really nice balance . i have another but i could n't drink it right away . i think i 'll age it for a year or so . 02/26/11 after drinking my second three philosophers i had to come back and increase my ratings . the balance of sweet malts , spice and alcohol is really impressive and delicious . i 'll get this again very soon . i will also reach out and experiment with other quads ."

S"for my 100th review , i thought i 'd revisit the beer that started it all for me ( and probably many bas , for that matter ) -- the classic samuel adams boston lager . it 's been a while since i 've had one , so i 'm curious to see how it holds up . appearance : a light amber/deep honey ( what happened to that trademark deep orange hue ? ) with a dense , pure white head . fair retention . champagne-fine , super active carbonation . leaves lace on the glass and a collar throughout . smell : hmmm -- much milder than i remembered . the first scent is an almost-pilsner , possibly saaz hop spice . as it warms , a caramel maltiness emerges , as does a faint flowery/citrus fragrance . taste/mouthfeel : slightly malty up front with a hint of chocolate that i did n't remember it having . it 's a bit macro-grainy midpalette , but finishes with a bitter , hoppy bite . clean , dry aftertaste . the mouthfeel is soft , slightly coating , a bit light and finishes crisp with a zing of carbonation . drinkability : among the best ; consistent , flavorful , fairly light , almost always available and usually wallet-friendly -- it 's sort of this generation 's michelob , i suppose . that said , i was a bit surprised at how ... small this beer seems . i do n't know if it 's been dumbed-down over the years or i 've just gotten used to bigger beers , but it 's not the powerhouse i remember it being . it 's still a good beer -- great on tap , imho -- and if nothing else , it did ween a lot of people , myself included , off the macro swill and onto bigger and much better things . that ought to count for something ."

S"bottled on 9/30/09 . poured from bottle into a snifter . bad bottle ? ? ? ? ( i do n't know . it does n't taste infected , i just really do n't like it ... at all . i ca n't see how anyone has given high reviews ) a- pours a reddish-brown color that can be seen through when held up to the late . off-white , 1-finger head that dissipates rather quickly . leaves a spotty film over the surface . s- booze ( slightly sour ) , sweet/sugary flavor . honestly , it smells like an amplified bmc ... sort of metallic , bland , that awful aroma i associate with a bud light . t- sweet , maybe raisins , but i ca n't really say for sure . overly sugary . does n't taste as bad as it smells , but i am very unimpressed . i have n't had this beer in 4 years or so ( when i first got into craft beers ) and i have vastly different memories of this beer . m- kind of thin , decent carbonation . nothing really making this good or bad . d- taste is n't great , but it goes down fairly easy and for 8 % abv . it goes down remarkably well . not a good beer overall though . i have to assume i got a bad bottle ? if not , then reviews i have read are extremely far off ."

S"pours a bright , clear yellow from the bottle , with a clean , white head into a pilsner glass . head is gone fairly quickly , but left a little lacing on the way down the glass . smell does n't clue me in on much ; it takes some concentration to find the hop aroma . taste is nice ; even though you can certainly tell there 's a little corn involved . has a little sweetness on the tongue that dissapears into a little bitterness bite ( but not too much ) . dry and crisp on the tongue . also a clearly very easy to drink beer ; a large number of these could vanish while watching the ballgame pretty easily . its a little similar to their pilsner , but with a little more heavy mouthfeel ( although still be aware its not on the heavy end of the spectrum ) and fuller taste . my take on this beer : a very refreshing , clean adjunct lager in the american style . this is what the big boys ' beers would taste like if they were any good . sure , it wo n't make it on to my top ten list of greatest beers in the world , and it wo n't get a high rating on this site because it 's not a belgian strong dark ale , but it sure as heck could be a common purchase given how easily it goes down ."

S'a poured a nice pale golden yellow , lots of visible carbonation flying upto the top from the bottom of the glass . a nice large two inch plus head formed initially but then reluctantly settled back down to earth and left just a thin glaze of lace across the top . s lots of grain , wheat with a touch of a light apple yeast to it . maybe a hop in the back , but nothing really the discernable . t very nice weiss indeed . had a very light , corn , grain , wheat flavor , just about what you would have expected from it . but had a nice little hoppiness in there which is much different then most of your strictly german weiss . this was really a nice added bonus and made this that much tastier . m super crisp and clear . great carbonation kept going until the very bitter end . had a good consisitency and really a nice refreshing quality to it . d about as good as it gets . this is perfect for a warm afternoon , you can really have a bunch and not really fill up so quickly . just perfect one for the game or mowing the lawn , really nice . overall this was a great little surprise in a can , and just keeps the ball rolling on my canned goodness . i have yet to find a bad canned brew , they all come out tasting very fresh and just seem to have a better and more consistent carbonation then a bottle . i really enjoyed this one and would look forward to more slyfox in the future .'

S"a : dark , nearly opaque , brown s : very pleasant ; notes of bread most apparent ; chocolate aroma also elbows in here t : chocolate comes in first and coffee is not far behind ; slight burnt smokiness also present ; the hops steer the beer towards a ( very ) light russian imperial stout in terms of flavor ; bitterness is pleasant upfront ; however , a more unpleasant bitterness creeps in on the back palate m : a slightly lighter mouthfeel than expected for a cream stout , but no complaints otherwise d : an unpleasant bitterness persists on the back palate moving me to score drinkability slightly below average strengths : smell wins hands down here as the beer 's most positive attribute scoring a 4.5 and nearly a 5 ; strange but interesting flavor combination for a cream stout weaknesses : an unpleasant back palate bitterness disrupts this beer between sips ; overall , the combination of flavors comes together fairly well , but the smokiness may be a bit too prominent though this may sound a bit odd for its style , this beer is definitely a good option if you are craving russian imperial stout flavor wrapped in a lighter ( and lower abv ) package"

S"12oz brown bottle with best before june 2006 . pours a very cloudy straw colored beer with copper hues attempting to pierces the murk . head is thick initially , about 2 fingers , and settles to a creamy white lace with sticky trails along the glass . what 's odd about the appearance is that everything remains in suspension . there 's zero settling ( my bottle was kept cold for over a week ) . i looked for dregs , and found none , but the residual beer in the bottle had an odd consistency to it . they must be adding something to keep everything in suspension and always in a `` state of unfilteredness ? '' wheaty aroma , with spicy with coriander , anise , lemon peel and a florally fruitiness . light , but very smooth and creamy on the palate . creaminess is a big part of this brew . low levels of sweetness , with wheat and associated husky tannins taking the front . nice spicy hop profile with fresh hop leaf oils on the palate from the tettnanger hops . floral rose hips blend well with a light lemony twang , and slight orangey juiciness . very tea like with a dusty coriander edge and faint flavor of anise . touch of vanilla behind the citrus fruitiness . herbal dryness towards the finish with wheat tannins becoming more pronounced as the beer warms , with a bit of lemon peel in the linger . overall , it 's not all that bad ... but if they got some control over all of those tannins it 'd be a much more appealing brew ."

S'this review was done from a 12oz bottle from the 2003 batch . with a fairly aggressive pour into a snifter a giant off white head rose out to fill the glass to the top . the body was a deep cherry red with decent clarity . as the head dropped fairly quickly and this was consumed scattered lacing was left decorating the glass . malt sweetness was dominant in the nose with strong alcohol notes and fruit notes mixed in . not bad overall but fairly simple and a bit under whelming . flavor is very similar to the nose with a deep fruit sweetness hitting the taste buds first before a slight alcohol bite on the back end . there were little hops detected in this but they were doing theyre job as this was not overly sweet . mouthfeel was fairly full and warming . the alcohol still stood out a good deal even after about a year of ageing which hurt the drinkability a little . i will have to re-review when the 2004 batch comes out so it is a fresh sample .'

S'ok , if a bottle has a picture of a dog on it , it automatically gets a point taken off . thankfully , lagunitas opted to go for the plain white label with this one , though i am about willing to take a point off for the stupid , wanna-be clever diatribe on the back of the bottle . og=1.080 , 72.41 ibu , 7.5 % abv . slightly cloudy orange brew forms a nice-sized white head with good retention and lacing . aroma is pungent with grapefruit , sharp citric hops , with cloaked , faint suggestions of oranges , apples , and toasty grains . carbonation is moderate . taste begins with over the top citric hops with semisweet pale and crystal malts , followed by a lightly toasted , intensely bitter dry finish . this is an example of dumping a ton of hops into a brew and calling it an ipa , throwing balance and drinkability to the wind . the dry mouthfeel and overzealous acidity give me a bad case of reflux , but at least the zesty burps make up for it . typical west-coast over the top hop taste , but absolutely horrible drinkability . if they spent as much time on their brewing as they did on their prose , they might be able to eek a winner out of this train-wreck of a beer .'

S"ah , the final of the 3 longshots from this year -- the first two i had were definitely solid , and this one would prove to be just as good . i 'm actually quite impressed by these beers and have much more of an appreciation for what sam adams is doing with this competition . the review is from notes taken on 6/27/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip . appearance : pour is a crisp golden yellow and starts with a one finger , soft off-white head with solid retention and eventually fades to a full and uneven cap ; body is very clear and shows tiny , quick and strong carbonation ; a few washes and spots of lacing are left behind . smell : light and sweet mellow fruitiness and bready esters ; a light toasty graininess with a bit of a zesty citric blend ; quite nice and fairly robust with just a spot of spiciness lingering in the back . taste : really nice , and possibly the best of the longshots this year ; nice smooth and sweet fruits with a yeasty breadiness ; a mild lemony/citric zest with a bit of peppery ( duh , yet a little reminiscent of white pepper ) belgian spiciness ; there 's a bit of a toasty/earthy graininess lingering in the aftertaste . mouthfeel : a rather light and very effervescent body comes across as soft and foamy ; a moist stickiness is left behind ; really a refreshingly sweet and spicy beer with great balance with the toastiness . drinkability : this is definitely an all day kind of beer -- a great drink with great flavors and solid balance ; very refreshing and makes for a great summer beer ; also , the moderate 6.4 % abv makes it pretty easy drinking as well ."

S"appearance : unfortunately , it looks like i 've got myself a bad bottle . the crown on the beer cap looked a little banged up , but otherwise appeared to be well sealed . however , after a completely silent pop-topping and a lifeless appearance after a relatively rough pour it appears all carbonation has escaped this brew . must be a collaboration brew with lost abbey . aside from that , the beer is a cloudy , dirty apple cider color with heaps of sediment floating around . smell : some nice hoppy bitterness with a tequila booze quality to it . the combination actually works pretty well , however i would have liked more of a hop presence to it . taste : interesting , i 'm actually get more of a tequila taste than an ipa taste . the tequila flavor is good , and the lack of the classic tequila burn allows the flavors of the ipa to come through . overall it 's not bad ... an interesting ipa for sure . mouthfeel : unfortunately , the complete lack of carbonation really kills this beer for me . drinkability : this beer has the makings of a good drinking , tasty ipa . i love the hops , and i do love me some tequila , . unfortunately , however , i ca n't give this brew high drinkability marks due to the complete lack of carbonation which ruins the overall feel of the beer . i will say , however , that i would very much like to try this brew again and update this review . until that happens , though , this review will stand ."

S"12 oz . bottle ( no freshness date ) poured into my infamous sn pint glass ... a-thick and frothy four fingers of tan head laying atop a hazy orange , almost copper body s-ultra spicy hips , with a small kick of pale malts and some caramel t-slight citrus ( tangerine ? ) up front with loads of pale malts throughout m-smooth and simply d-sessionable , no questions asked a simply style that is always hard to rate for me yet so easy to drink ... this brew is one of the better ambers that i 've had to date ... it 's no cindercone , but a good one nonetheless . way to go bell 's !"

S'notched best by may 2011 pours golden copper with 1+ finger head that left no lacing smells of grassy hops and a touch of caramel malt taste is just like the nose but there is a funky metal flavor that just ruins any pleasure i might get from sipping this mouthfeel was spot on - light and crisp overall - again the taste of metal made me drain pour most of this'

S"poured into a duvel tulip . the beer pours a murky red , with a thick head . the aroma is of marijuana : pungent , musky , earthy , and fungal . the aroma is strong , and potent . if someone decided to make a pot beer , this is what it would smell like . the taste is obliterated by the aroma . it 's strong , pungent , vaguely unpleasant , and i ca n't pick out any specifics because the smell is completely clouding my taste perception . the whole time , i 'm thinking `` is this what a pot beer tastes like ? '' regardless , this is one of the worst beers i 've ever tasted . overall , i think this beer is terrible . it smells like weed , it tastes vaguely foul , kind of how i imagine a pot beer would taste . my taste buds are generally in-sync with the founders brewers , and i tend to really like their beer , but this brew is awful . i 'm going to cellar the other bottle and hope that age managed to work some miracle and redeem this concoction ."

S"this beer poured out very pale and clear yellow color and was topped with a small white and creamy head . faint wheat malt aroma and flavors . a very light , golden beer with touches of bitter hops . had a very clean aftertaste and was very drinkable . i actually thought i was poured a pabst blue ribbon at first ! in the dark bar i was in , it looked very similar and there were actually similar flavors . i liked this beer nothing fancy just a pleasant , easy drinking beer . i 'm not sure if i detected any specific flavors from the rye . i like the garden hose tap handle ."

S"2010 bottle from city beer store in sf , made the trip back in my suitcase . been trying to hold off , but what the hell . pours a typical black , some brown in the light on the edge of the glass . thin layer of carbonation slowly recedes . a couple swirls gives another thin layer . looks good . smells are sweet vanilla oaky bourbon . brown sugar mixing in well ( maple syrup too ? ) i spent a lot of time just smelling this beer , more than other bourbon stouts in recent memory . tastes mingle really well . the interplay between the vanilla , wood , brown sugar , and bourbon is intoxicating . bourbon prominent , but prominent within the context of the other flavors , does n't overwhelm or burn . mouthfeel a bit thinner than expected , but i 'm tiring of gooey stouts , and it worked well with the flavors . slides down the back of the tongue , not sticking , just leaving clean tracks . nice . i liked it pretty fresh , and would drink it that way in the future . it 's just going to get thicker and the sharp interplay between the flavors would likely start to fade as time went on . hard to justify 15+ for a 12oz bottle , however , even if it is this good . quite frustrating it 's not priced to compete with other bourbon stouts ."

S'this beer is a pretty solid rauchbier . poured a dark amber color with a small , tan head . unfortunately , there was very small retention and no real lacing worth mentioning . the smell was very nice and smoky , reminding me of wooden embers being snuffed out at the end of a big bonfire . the taste was equally as smoky , reminding me a little bit of burnt bacon and again , the taste of the embers . the mouthfeel was nice and full-bodied and it went down pretty smooth . while i am usually a fan of rauchbiers , halfway through this one i was not really enjoying it so much anymore . it did not really have me asking the bartender for another one . i would definitely give it a go , especially when i was out camping .'

S'tasted from the bottle during a visit to the brasserie caulier caf and brewery . the third beer during the visit , and as with all the others , the trademark thrusting loud pop from the flip of the swing top echoed by now though , the assembled masses at out table had got used to it . appearance : a very hazy brown amber body , the bottle i had somehow managed to spew all of its sediment in my top-up pour , no matter how careful i was with the bottle . the head is off-white and struggled to maintain anything other than a passing resemblance to a collar . nose : warm roasting malts , some nuts and a funky farmyard earthiness in the nose . light in strength but it has a character that somehow says im an old tired beer that regularly pisses my pants ; talks about the good old days yet cant remember my name . weird aromas . taste : tastes much better than it looks and smells . the 8 % ( as listed on the caf menu ) supports the amber well , and probably rescues it from a very average marking for taste . starts with a nice nut brown malt feel , middles with some lightly warming alcohol and finishes with a nice bitterness that rounds out the beers amber character . that said , it is still very average , and as the sediment came into play after my last top-up , a funky earthy feel took over the whole show which ruined the beer . i would definitely recommend letting this settles , and most certainly refraining from dunking the sediment into this beer . mouthfeel : the alcohol adds some balls to an otherwise very average feel . a nutty feel is detectable in the middle of the beer and adds some complexion to a beer that is in danger of being overwhelmed by its high prickly carbonation . drinkability : i struggled with this , im not sure if the previous two bitter-fruit beers had altered my palate , but judging by what everyone else in our party thought of this maybe it wasnt . not that agreeable , one glass was enough . overall : not really impressed by this one . completely forgettable .'

S"batch 4x1 . pours a hazy copper orange color with a large two finger white head that 's kept afloat with some gentle swirls , and leaves some killer sheets of lacing all down the duvel tulip . absolutely fabulous looking . lots of carbonation bubbles being released from the laser etching , so i give it several swirls to get the aroma going . very pleasing , oaky , wine-like aroma with only a touch of funk in the background . light vinegar and cherries are in there somewhere , along with some citrus fruits . holy tomole , this is one sour brew ! starts out tart and sour , followed by a sweetness from the malts that are buried deep within , followed by some tart cherry , although the cherry is a little less prominent than i had expected , along with some lemony flavors that are generally associated with the brett , and a dry , oaky , vinous finish . not much in the way of musty , leathery type flavors and aromas i usually get from wilds , which is a nice change . overall , a tart , fruity , wine-like dry beer . good stuff . body is medium , with high carbonation . as the beer gets close to the bottom of the glass , most of the carbonation has subsided from constant swirling ( i ca n't help but swirl this glass and bury my nose in it ) and it has become quite creamy , which is in an interesting contrast to the bite of the acidity . overall , this is one great brew and the 375ml serving is perfect . it 's sour as hell which could kill the drinkability in any bigger of a containment vessel , but this serving was just right . becomes incredibly more cherry like and complex as it warms , and once the carbonation has mellowed , this is one fine beer . not sure if i like it more than consecration , but it 's another great from rr . ca n't wait to see how this one ages ."

S"a beer that some of my friends would consider amazing and thick . however since i have drank many more stouts i realize that guinness is not that good . the nitro can makes for a great looking head and smooth creaminess . but this beer has no punch , its flavors are subdued . it is not that thick and because of the weakness of alcohol , none present in taste which is n't a good thing , it takes way too many to have a buzz or dare i say get drunk . subdued malt , a little more hops than a usual stout , and no noticeable finish . good marketing keeps guinness on top , not quality !"

S"i 've had this just about every way it comes . on tap , bottle canned ... right now i have it in a nitro can , bought in paris . poured into a tulip glass . i do n't care what the overall sentiment for guinness is , the appearance is perfectly brilliant . the cascading effect lasts for well over a minute , with a perfectly pitch black color . the smell is fairly nondescript . a bitter sensation is the immediate reaction , followed by a weak chocolate presence , and then the roasted malt . taste is okay . as far as a stout goes , i expect a lot more in terms of anything -- roasted malt , chocolate , smokiness , coffee flavor . certainly all of these are present , but not in any exceptional way . the mouthfeel is definitely enjoyable , more so on-tap . a syrupy medium+ body shows itself . sadly not full bodied , but i 'll give it credit for originality . in terms of drinkability , guinness is a fairly easy drinking stout . the low abv lends itself to a sessionable beer , and it does n't seem too imposing . i certainly enjoy guinness , and while the review may not do it justice , i 'll take it over most beers ."

S"a - pours a beautifully clear copper that i can actually read my monitor through . there is a finger of white head that quickly dies down from the top of the beer but the lacing stays . s - lots of light sweet maltiness but other then that 's left is a bit of belgian yeast and a hint of spice . t - taste has a lot more to it then the smell would suggest . the same light and sweet maltiness hits the tongue first , but the belgian spice and some slight fruitiness finishes out the taste . i would hand this to a macro drinker in a heartbeat to show them something close to what they know , but far better . m/d - mouthfeel is a bit weak for my tastes , but it certainly does n't have any bad qualities to it . this really shines in drinkability , this is a very easy drinker , goes down smooth and quickly with a decent taste . considering i bought the 12 beers of winter specifically to try this and the rye ipa , i do n't feel too bad for the purchase ."

S"fortunately for me , i live 8 minutes away from victoryville and am there alot . the boys pulled out a 1/2 bbl on 8/23/2004 and i was there promptly at noon . what can i say about one of the best brews ever brewed by one of the best breweries ? after looking cloesly at this 8 month old brew that was stored in a cooler i did notice a touch of chill haze . the physical stability of the beer was just on the edge . the color was still great . that 's why i did n't give it a 5 for appearance . the nose however was strong , bold , and was just like i remembered it when it came out the first time . this batch was defintely frist batch . ron barchet confirmed this by reminding me no second batch ( the dry hopped version ) was bottled exclusively . the nose has hints of pine , grapefruit , and wonderful blended hops . the taste was wonderful . it 's mellowed not ! it 's still as bold , smack ya upside the head as ever . for those who love the turly hopped up brews , this one 's for you ! wow ! the mouthfeel was most pleasant and it is extremelty deceptive in terms of the abv . no noticable alcohol burn on the way down . 3.5 for drinklability because of the abv - this ai n't no session beer ! enjoy !"

S'cask pint at nerax on 5/2/07 definitely some haze left in this one , not sure why it was served yet , though perhaps they felt this was as bright as it was going to get . a very light amber body has strong gold overtones with a thick , creamy white head that shows medium retention and moderate lacing . very hoppy in the nose , tons of fruitiness from the amarillos giving off notes of peach , nectarine , light grapefruit and melon . its served on a fluffy , probably creamy malt base that seems higher in dextrines than in actual sweetness . rye dosent give the typical spiciness level that most other rye beers do , but rather adds quite a bit of nuttiness that seems to dull the hop presence lightly . strong yeast presence on the finish , while clean , also serves to dull the hops . warming brings with it more pale malt sugars than first seen , and the beer goes from almost balanced to just overly malty/sweet . no alcohol or flaws noted , however . a strong malt base pumps out a lot of vanilla and cream sweetness , as peachy hops with a light twinge of pine try to break through . hop character never gains nearly enough bitterness or flavor and just seems to be soaked up by the malts , giving it a fruity-sweet maltiness . carbonation is precariously low , exposing both wateriness but also an excess of malt texture that makes the beer fatiguingly difficult to finish . rye seems lost amidst the creaminess and underattenuated body . lots of doughy yeast on the finish . no alcohol or flaws , however . will try it again on draught and see how that goes .'

S"brilliant packaging ! fun color ! entertaining shmaltz notation ! but yikes ... this beer was almost difficult to suck down . it looks like `` red pop '' - even the head is pinkish . it 's bitter , kind of medium bodied and really not very exciting . although i could n't find `` red dye no . x '' on the label , i swear there was the faint taste of food coloring in each sip . it 'd be a fun beer for a halloween party but maybe just for a glass ."

S"you know what 's weird ? i had the flying dog pale ale on tap a few weeks ago , and then i had the bottle version of their ipa today . the relative hoppiness in the pale is greater . it 's strange . this ipa did not taste like an american ipa to me . maybe , just maybe , it could have been classified as an english ipa . the beer poured a deep golden color . there was not that much of an aroma though , and most of the aroma was dominated by a caramel malt nose . the beer was well balanced , albeit a little off-balanced for an ipa . what seemed to be lacking was a strong hop presence upfront ... perhaps a strong dose of bittering hops needed . the beer was medium bodied , and seemed to be slight in carbonation . overall , it was a very drinkable beer , even though it seemed a bit out of style ."

S"extra received from beerfmandy in a recent trade . thanks ! poured into my pint glass . pours a hazy very-pale yellow with a thin white head on top . disappears to a sheet on top . leave no lace . smells of grains , buttered corn , and a splash of lemon zest . moderate body with a nice carbonation kick with each sip . carbo . level is medium/high . now the flavor is a conundrum . this tastes exactly what a crisp american lager would taste like , a good one at that . plenty of buttery grains in the mouth , some light citrus , and a light pop of bitterness on the finish . if this was labeled as a lager , i would rate it a 'b ' minimum , but as a saison , this is way off . i can taste very light yeast and funk in the aftertaste , but it is so faint , it may be my imagination . this one needs some work , or at least a re-styling ."

S"exciting dive into a new style ; this one was given to me blind so i had no idea what i was drinking . pale straw colour , nice and opaque . head is white , nice and creamy with pleasant clingy lace , just a thin crown . really rather pleasant . smells very rank , but in a good way . massive earthy , rubbery funk with acid of a citric nature , organic grain notes with a touch of livestock feed , wet hay and some really pleasant and piquant spice notes , including star anise and coriander . great . taste is a bit of a letdown , but still not bad at all . lots of wheat character with tart , raw wheat notes , some citric character that comes through on the mid and lingers towards the back but is unsupported by malt so ends up being a tad insipid . slight tangerine twist to it , hints of yellow capsicum , rice vinegar and maybe some coriander . decent palate , not amazing though . decently full and smooth , bit of drying texture towards the back . quite nice . good drinkin ' beer , nice and flavoursome but it pulls back in the important areas to make it quaffable . salt is not detectable - all the more power for it ."

S'poured a light golden yellow into my hotd tulip glass and produced a very large , off white , frothy head . the smell was slightly sweet but was dominated by a grapefruit floral aroma . actually quite pleasing . the taste was all grapefruit . it actually tasted like it was drinking the juice from grapefruit skin . after a few sips it was modestly tolerable , but i reserve grapefruit for breakfast . the mouthfeel was very tart , thin , and had quite a bit of carbonation . this was not a drinkable beer for me . i am a stout , porter , old ale drinker and had this just to get an appreciation for hops and how their flavor contributes to a beer . by itself , hops are not pleasing to me . but when balanced out with some malt , fruit , etc , they add complexity to the beverage . try the experiment if you will , it was fun albeit not to tasty .'

S"reviewing a very tasty beer from stone . wegmans ' amazing $ 10.99 make your own six pack offer is opening my eyes to beers that i 'd otherwise be reluctant to pay a pretty penny for , this being one of them . never seen it for less than $ 16 for a six-pack , and now i know why . this is one hell of a beer , certainly on the level of ruination ipa and sublimely self-righteous for me , an instant favorite of the stone lineup . a : in the words of ron burgundy , this beer is a 'rich mahogany ' in the glass . every time you think you can see through it , it seems to aggressively swirl 'round and darken , it 's like looking into an optical trap . pours with a beautiful dark beige head that went right to the tippy top of my unibroue tulip . gorgeous beer . s : a bit threatening . hop aroma is very pleasant , as well as slightly sweet malts that suggest a full-bodied experience to me . a slight woodsiness is detectable on the nose but not overwhelming the other aromas like a lot of oak aged beers . a very nice aroma , something that i 'd like condensed down onto a cardboard tree so i can hang it over my rear view mirror . pure wonderful beer aroma . t : the taste is ... wow . very hoppy , nearly on the level of a double or triple ipa ( how an oak aged beer has managed to stay this aggressively hoppy and bitter is beyond me , but i have never experienced an oak aged ipa that has such a fresh hop taste ) . i guess sweet burnt caramel-y malt and splintery oak flavors are there , but this one 's a hop bomb through and through . yowza . m : tingles on the tongue , and totally numbs it up . dentists should use this one before going in with that huge shot of novocaine , my mouth is now slack and barely has any feeling left . i 'm practically drooling . it 's a good thing . d : it 's going to be a bit of a chore to get through more than one bottle , it 's certainly not a session beer , but that 's not to the detriment of the entire experience , it 's just a fact of the matter . it 's a very full-bodied beer , especially at 7 % abv , and it should be respected and perhaps even feared . this one has more flavor , body , and character than even double bastard . it 's excellent ."

S'poured from a growler into a tulip pint glass . dry-hopped with amarillo and centennial hops , according to the menu at the stone company store . a : hazy , light amber color with one finger of persistent white foam head . moderate lacing remains on the glass . s : hops dominate , but do not smother , with floral and juicy citrus qualities . malt is soft and toasty , subordinate but not left out , while carbonic acid enhances the citric side of the hops and also imparts a crisp edge . t : begins off-dry , with variable moderate-to-pungent hop aromatics of pineapple and savory cooking herbs . moderate acidity is also present , remaining within acceptable bounds and adding to early brightness . the middle and finish are more malt-focused , yet the footprint of the grain is feather-light and bready . bitterness is subdued for the style , lingering at the edges of the tongue and generally staying out of the way . m : medium viscosity , slightly sticky on the palate , with moderate carbonation . d/o : freshness is the imperative winning element present in this beer , setting it apart from the standard formula in a fashion that has nothing to do with the brewed-on date . the hop flavors are both titillating and palate-filling at their most intense , yet the perceived intensity varies with each sip and the different aromatic qualities seem not to be entirely copacetic . still , the finished product is a minor wonder to behold , probably comparable to any other american ipa with similar ( limited ) availability .'

S"appearance : really deep , ruddy-brown when held up to the light , but against a black backdrop it looks almost like a stout . one finger of head that dissipates after about a minute with minimal lacing . aroma : great . really bright floral hops up front ( so much so that i was a bit surprised ) with a strong malt back . sweeter malt tones , more sugarcane than biscuit i 'd say . taste : very nice strong sweet malt up front that fades to alcohol warming , but comes back in a lingering finish at the very end ( maybe 10 seconds after taking a sip ) . my problem here is that it 's all at the very beginning and the very end , the middle and most of the finish are dominated by alcohol warmth . while i smell the hops ' florality ( is that a word ? i just really did n't want to have to say `` floweriness '' ) it is mostly obscured by the alcohol . maybe 20 % of the sips i took had a hint of hops in the finish , but not most . mouthfeel : i was a bit surprised by this beer 's mouthfeel . i was expecting a bit more robust , chewy , smooth and heady beer , but the carbonation is a bit more aggressive and the fullness just is n't there . nearing the end i enjoyed it better , but i 'm not sure that lettng a beer lose some of it 's carbonation for a good mouthfeel is ideal drinkability : not drinkable at all . or , rather , not sessionable at all . my roommate and i tried this at the same time on a sunday afternoon : it took us both about an hour to finish 12 oz and he immediately took a nap afterward . you can order this one to avoid buying a second drink at the pub , but that 's really the only virtue here . verdict : if you 're a fan of barley-wines , it 's worth trying actually , maybe even if you are n't a fan it 's worth trying , as i 'd say this is ( though not out of this world ) a good intro to the style . i would n't say it 's the best of this style that i 've ever had , but it 's not bad , and to be fair , it is a bit green , and might be better with a year or two of age on it ."

S"a- pours a very pretty amber orange with rich brown tones . perfect clarity , average amounts of carbonation visible . rocky laced head , just off white . pours nice and full , thins out only some while sitting . s- as expected , this is a very hoppy beer . nice smells of citrus fruits , mandarin oranges , maybe slight honey aroma ? sweet and citrusy . t- juicy , sticky hop buds come to mind at the first sip ; just oozing sticky hop oils . pine and ganja resin . initial short burst of dried fruits , then a mellowing bitter than spreads nicely across my mouth . lingering woody bitterness . there is a surprising ammount of counter balance from the sweet malts , a little balance is good in the style . as far as ipa 's go , i 've had better tasting examples . this unfortunately falls a bit short of success . the flavor is a little dried up seeming . m- medium light body with exceptional smoothness . the carbonation stays quietly on the sides . great work here . d- eh . this is not my type of beer . i could n't drink more than one of these in a sitting ."

S"pours quite a light golden amber colour , with plenty of streaming carbonation . head is a big fluffy pile of white head . some sticky lacing but not a lot . light , sweaty character on the nose - hints of bread yeast , leather and cooked vegetables . hint of honey comes though a little . but it 's very light , and very subdued . not a lot on the nose . very little on the initial palate , a thin , watery insipidness , which wells up into a rather unpleasant bitter yeast character . if i did n't know better i 'd say it was brewed with pride of ringwood hops , the bane of australian macro-brewery . very little to enjoy on the palate . mouthfeel is light to moderate . ok , but not great . quite disappointed with this brew - a very light-on-flavour beer . not much to recommend it , i 'm afraid , which is a shame , because i love anchor steam ."

S"a - hazy , burn-orange hue , with a thin , lacy head . s - sweet malt and candied orange , maybe a little ginger , with a slight pine-hoppiness in the background . t - the standard , candy malt flavor is the first thing to hit your tongue , but is almost instantly covered up with a spicy fruit punch . the finish is very dry and hoppy , with very little of the sweetness lingering . the true barleywine style sweetness is n't very complex or remarkable , but the pale ale hoppiness is interesting . not quite balanced , but not out of balance either . m - very thick and creamy , though the tongue gets a zap from the hops . maybe a little too gummy . d - the dryness certainly helps make the sweetness easier to digest . at 9 % , this is fairly easy going ."

S"consumed 10/11/10 a disclaimer : i 'm partial to hops and fresh ones at that , so there 's no doubt my review on all harvest/wet/fresh hop beers will be biased based on my own likings . a : poured into sam adams perfect pint . yellow straw , brilliant and clear . finger of white head that sticks to all sides of my glass . mmm , fresh hops . s : peach , mango , apricots , and sugar coated grapefruit . really , the smell reminds me of eating a grapefruit halve sprinkled with a heavy coating of table sugar . ca n't wait to stick my serrated-tipped spoon into this one . ( i apologize for the innuendo ) t : huge hops and grapefruit . oranges . no alcoholic bite on the finish . f : for such a small malt presence , there has to be one here , because the mouth feel is creamy enough in the beginning . i really enjoy pas/ipas that feel this way . creamy up front , just the right bitterness on the finish . a full experience for the mouth . d : this is the fruitiest pa i 've had yet , no doubt to the recently-harvested hops . i wish it was n't sold in a 4 pack , considering i 'll be trading half of it away . i could have easily had two more without destroying my palate ."

S"consumed on 09/03/08 . `` best by 12/12/09 '' warns the bottle . a conservative pour of this clear , dark brown beer nets a thin , light tan head made of fairly large bubbles . it quickly dissipates into just a little sticky lacing . a bit anemic in appearance for a ris . aroma is chocolate , coffee , vanilla and red grape . alcohol has a defininte presence in the nose as well . moderately thick beer with almost no carbonation . sweet dark malt flavor with oaky red wine overtones . oddly , very little scotch character to the nose or the palate . bitterness not a strong component of the flavor . warmth from the alcohol is pronounced on the swallow . that , combined with the too-sweet character of the beer and the disappointing lack of complexity made this 11.2 ounce bottle hard for me to finish solo . i had planned on aging this one , but found myself reaching for the bottle with only a few weeks on it . might be worth aging ; it 's certainly nothing special now ."

S'a- appearance is a nice amber color but it is a little cloudier than i would like to see . low head retention . s- aroma was very mild with some small notes of hops shining through . t- clear caramel malty flavor followed by some hops finish m- beer was slightly thicker than a typical beer and leaves a dry taste in your mouth afterwards d- drinkiability is low because the beer has a thick filling texture and dry aftertaste you only want a beer or two . this beer might be good with dinner or to try sometime but is not one i would order a pitcher of and drink all night .'

S"as black as guinness , with a light brown head that sticks to the glass and boasts quality retention . it reeks of dark fruits and alcohol , with a smokey caffeen flavour helped along by some dark fruits and a mild tobacco aftertaste . it 's as smooth as silk - perfectly suited as a dinner and desert sipper and easily the best porter i 've had the pleasure of tasting ."

S"stocked up on beers i ca n't get in maine , and realized that sometimes i do forget how a beer tasted after awhile . so i 'm doing a lot more reviews for my own benefit . pours a foamy head with great lacing . does n't foam up too much as to require two pours , which is a plus . smells boozy with dark caramelized and maybe eveb german malts . going into this blind i might have guessed it was a doppelbock . taste : no , definitely not a doppelbock . that was dumb . sweet , but not sweet enough to hide the alcohol . that 's fine- sometimes i like when a beer is honest with me . this is probably the booziest , harshest scottish ale i 've ever had . that 's not a bad thing , but it means this is a sipper if there ever was one . medium bodied despite all the sweetness . i bet i could drink 2 of these in a row ."

S"pours a thin , light golden color , almost completely transparent . decent soapy looking head . smells like a thin pale wheat , some wheatiness combined with a wet-dog like almost musty smell . hints of lime or something unique in there , but not very impressive . while not the most impressive beer , certainly a step up above most macro lagers . dry wheat flavor , straightforward malt flavor , not real sweet or much to it . a hint of lime/citrus kick , mildly hopped . kind of watery mouthfeel , not overly satisfying . drinkability is top notch , however , it is clean , no metallic , astringent or bitter aftertastes of any kind . it 's like after you take a swill , it does n't taste like the greatest thing , but you want to keep drinking it . mostly inoffensive , i can see this being a good intro to people who usually drink macro lagers , to show that the craft world can be benign as well ."

S'as you can see by my numerical scoring of this beer , this beer , in my view , is ultimately average . nearly every aspect of this beer is average . it smells like nothing special , and it tastes like a slightly more complex macro-brew . it pours decently , however , with an acceptable frothy head , minimal lacing , and a nice copper color . this beer tastes like , well , generic beer . its only overriding characteristic is its moderate bitterness . nothing else stands out flavor-wise . i must say , however , that this beer is more than drinkable . if given a choice between this beer and , say , a coors , i would likely choose this again . given the choice between this beer and anything else , however , i would likely choose anything else ; -d'

S'1 pint 0.9 ounce bottle purchased at the north coast co-op in eureka , california . despite not being a monty python fan , the label is amusing enough and shouted at me from the imports case . pours hazy , translucent copper . stately cream-white head rises a full two inches and falls leaving scattered patches of thin lace on the glass . the nose is a mildly sour , grassy bitterness -- very plain old lager-like . digging deeper , and letting the brew warm up just a little bit , it smells less like a plain old lager ( which is good , because this aint a lager ) , spicier ( lemon-peppery ) and saccharine sweet . taste opens with a thin , sour bitterness that takes a second or two to rise to prominence and a steady background of lemony sweetness . the middle is nearly vacant , if not for some puffs of dust kicked up by the initial bitter burst and sweet background . aftertaste is dim bitterness , surrounded with some earthy crustiness ( like a few burnt toast crumbs sprinkled on my palate , not overwhelming ) . middling carbonation . thin mouthfeel ; rolls off like water . not bad , not bad at all , but not as good as the label .'

S"this beer finally made it 's way to dirty john 's in iowa city after a long wait . quite funky , but not in a bad way . very interesting . pours to a cloudy golden color with very little carbonation or head . recedes to a ring almost instantly . the smell is very good . has a funky barnyard must smell along with a strong banana and a very soft clove . even a bit of spicy hops . the taste is good as well . sweet banana esters up front but it instantly turns dry with the musty funk , clove , and a surprisingly large amount of hops . the body is fairly full with a carbonation that seems to gently massage the palate . very dry and bitter in the finish though , with a hint of alcohol . good beer , but drinkability suffers a little bit . the finish is almost unbearable , but the taste is very good . this means that you 'll either find yourself going through this fairly high proof beer either too quickly or very slowly ( unless , of course , a parched mouth is one of your `` things '' ) ."

S"smells of caramael , malty sweetness and a bit of toastiness . pretty rich ... i was surprised . floral hop crispness comes across the tongue initially with a medium degree of bitterness . not as strong as a standard apa ... perhaps halfway so . what follows is a good dose of caramel maltiness and toasty flavors in the middle to finish of the beer . there 's a little residual bitterness that lingers a bit after the swallow . it 's actually a very tasty beer that does an excellent job of balancing the right amount of hops with malt ."

S"thanks to the beer buyer at whole foods for finally getting this in from morris distributing ... clear light amber with an orange hue , no real head to speak of and middling carbonation . aromas strong with lemon , tangy fruit , like kiwi or raspberry . very interesting , unique and nice . some crisp , floral characteristics also . flavor is crazy tangy . almost like a sour or wild ale , but i 'm guessing this is n't using any brett . this must be the white wine grapes that are used in this one . like a saison , but has this biting finish that is like white wine . kind of wacky , if you ask me . my guess is this needs to be paired with food , right ... heh heh ... super complex , as it moves from almost sweet and juicy , to dry and tangy-bitter . pretty cool , but the finish is so weird it kills me . very decently drinkable , however , but the hefty pricetag will leave you gasping and really drops the drinkability for me . unique , but not sure if i would call it great beer . what i like most : the fruity , floral aromas . what i like least : the price of $ 6.49/bomber . ouch . verdict : worth trying due to its unique qualities , but not worth the price ."

S"found a bottle ( their last actually ) a few weeks back at charles st. liquors and picked it up . turned out it was a 1999 vintage . owing to some extranious issues that i wanted my head to get rid of , i popped the cork and dove in . pours out a thick , molten , deep , dark ( and i mean dark ) near black . there are some hints of golden brown on the edges . no head or carbonation to speak of ( i am guessing this dissipates due to the aging ... sigh ... ) . very pretty in a ferocious and menacing sort of way , like that fine looking gal you just know is trouble and should stay away from but just ca n't seem to take your eyes and mind off of . in the nose we get sourness , figs , raisins , plum cake , molasses , and a slight underlying sweetness . barely any alcohol fumes to speak of . certainly smells thick . in the mouth and on to the palate , the brew moves ever ... so ... slowly ... initial taste is of sour sweetness , faded chocolate syrup , malt , and thickly sweet port-like smoothness followed slowly by roasted coffee and roasted malt . this is capped off by a near eternal fade-out of a finish . lingering beyond that is a taste almost like dry grass or unhulled wheat . wild . certainly the complexity is impressive , but i wonder what flavors an un-aged bottle of this might bring . i do n't think the texture would make love to your mouth the way this one does , however ... despite all of this , however , i do n't think i could sip ( not drink , mind you , but sip ) more than one of these once in a great long while . since it has been a great long while since the last time i had one , voila . so `` drinkability '' goes down owing to the fact that this is something you pull out only on the very special occasions that merit it . you need patience and a thinking brain to consume one of these properly . a fine bottle , certainly , but one that requires your full , undived attention . would be truly magnificent paired with some stilton cheese , genoa salami , fresh butter , and pumpernickle bread . nb : i used to get this brew at the harvard provision when it was still open and really it was the first ( and best ) imperial stout i had ever had . obviously , things change during the aging/storing process so the stout i reviewed here tonight was quite different from the ones i remember . i do think i am prone to liking this brew more with a little carbonation and less age ."

S"a- easy head generation , giant bubbles cascade up from the cola colored body . it definitely is clear and should be given props for having light pass through , but docked for having a head that is medium to low retention . good lacing of off-tan colors give me the impression that there is more than meets the eye ... they cling on for dear life . s- not much going on here . very , very faint vanilla oak character , a sharp astringency of paper products follows before that . what could be a malty body lies in wait , musty at times like a bathroom . wish it actually had a nutty or bourbon character to speak of here . t- first notes to portray themselves are malty , light sweetness . transitions into a sharpness and bready nature that is more cellulose and less yeasty goodness than i want . finish is grainy , mildly sweet , mostly bread . its a sweetness like caramel syrup , but diluted out . after repeated consumption i 'm finding a burst of nutty character . like a handful of mixed nuts , that finishing combination of flavors right after the opening carbonation settles . m- crisp , bitingly so right off the cuff . lingering nature , sticky flavors that i do n't want and thin flavors that i do want . full body at least and very creamy . when i buy a bourbon barrel brown ale , guess what i want ? not this fucking beer ."

S"22 oz . bomber spotted at local liquor store . been wanting to try this for a while , jumped at the chance to drink it on a cold sleet filled afternoon . poured into a large glass goblet at just below room temperature . hmmm..label says stout , ba says belgian dark . i 'm assuming that makes this a belgian ( chocolate ) stout ? ommegang has this way of making all their beers look mouthwatering . a- wow . perfect pouring beer . thick black ale blocks nearly all light , and it looks fantastic in thick glass . a frothy desert tan head , which is leaving lacing before even being tasted . mouthwatering appearance . s- hops and malt seem to be in good balance . sharper hops follow mellow roasted mash , bittersweet chocolate scents . seems like i have to dig to get any real smell out of this beer , constant swirling in the hopes of coaxing more intense aromas out of this . why such faint smells ? t- taste is weak in spite of my anticipation of a thicker stout . it seems watered down . more aggressive hops presence , any chocolate or malt characteristics seem lost underneath the messy watered down hoppiness . i just ca n't taste the chocolate , i do n't sense the indulgence . this is not very rich , it 's thin tasting and the aftertaste is a sticky burnt bitterness that is strong and not very pleasant . i do n't know , i just do n't like this beer . i finished a glass , but i do n't know if i can down the last half of the bomber . m- this does have a fairly nice feel to it -- nice tensile feel , as it sits and warms , it loses it 's initial obtrusive carbonation . it smooths out and becomes a little thicker feeling . great beer to swirl around and break it up . still , the lingering bitterness and remaining carbonation becomes a sticky , sickly bittersweet mess on the throat and tongue . d- poor . misleading beer , not very stout-ish , and too much hops for me , even if it was a real stout . did n't sense any real chocolate ( and certainly nothing close to `` indulgence '' ) in it 's watery taste . what a disappointment this was ."

S"poured into a samuel smith 's imperial pint glass from a 12oz bottle . a : golden on top , brighter yellow towards the bottom and outskirts . nice looking beer , except for pour head retention , carbonation coating the sides of the glass , and poor lacing after the head quickly subsides . s : this really got me . i thought this beer would be amazing because the smell was overwhelmingly magnificent . i poured at about waist height and could still smell the beer as it rushed into my glass . bananas , varieties of citrus , and a slight caramel malt were all very detectable . it was bananas and `` bananas is good '' . t/m/d : mediocre at best . for all that i could smell , the flavors just did n't translate . very carbonated , almost stinging my tongue . did n't go down smooth , but it felt alright in my mouth after the carbonation subsided . strong alcoholic flavor too -- something i like when it comes from a lot of hops , but here it feels unnecessary and detrimental to the overall flavor . i thought this would be great , ended up decent . glad i snagged a bottle from my roommate and did n't buy this myself ."

S"one of several `` exciting '' brews left over from our friends on mardi gras . pours a clear golden color with a small white head that quickly dissipates . smell is of sweet corn and not much else . taste is just corn and grain with a slight sweetness . this is actually probably one of the better tatsing macros out there but i do n't think that is really saying much . feels like carbonated water but there 's nothing really horrible about this beer . for whatever reason it seems to be the most tolerable macro i can remember but obviously i 'd still avoid it if i can help it . but hell , for those guys who just drink beer for the effects , i suppose this is the best tasting thing you can get for about the cheapest price around . is that worth anything ?"

S"be careful with this one , very high and undetectable alcohol . pours a beautiful head in the belgium tradition . one of the best beers i 've ever had the pleasure of experiencing . great 3 finger head , fruity taste and hard to discribe unless tried . very expensive so hard to make it a session brew , but nice to have a few bottles lying around when the kids go to bed ! ! excellent beer ! !"

S"growler into a .5l stella artois glass . the beer has a smooth amber quality to the color . the head on my pours were small , i had trouble holding the glass at a good angle while pouring from the growler . the smell is n't remarkable , but the hops do n't make themselves nearly as present here as they do in the taste . i flavor is something else . as others have mentioned before me the brewer referred to this beer as a german ipa if such a beer existed . the flavors in this beer make you think it should have more alcohol , it is great to have such a flavorful beer at only 6.5abv . i would like to have seen more carbonation . i 've only had a few growlers before this , and i was a bit afraid that this one was flat before i saw other reviewers mention the lack of carbonation . i 'm not a big drinker , i rarely drink more than 24oz in a sitting , but i could easily down an entire growler of this if i tried . i wish it was available year round in cans ."

S"bomber to wine glass . reviewed upon it 's arrival to pa. a : pours with a one and a half finger foamy/frothy white head . decent retention . the light persimmon colored body is bright and richly radiant thanks to it 's haziness . sixty percent opacity . mediocre lacing . s : only british ingredients were used in the making of this brew ( minus colorado river water ) and given the aroma/flavor profile , it comes as no surprise . above average amount of toasted malts : bread , biscuits and grain . the harsh hop bill is dominated by pine , and reinforced by sawdust and grass . the yeast contributes a healthy does of must and sweat . t : impressive ? sure . great ? no . nothing new is presented on the palate that i was n't aware of or could n't have predicted from the nose . as stone brews have been accused of before , this here is a one-trick pony . m : one of the fullest and creamiest dipas i 've ever had . and then ? then the carbonation mercilessly decimates the taste buds while the hop bitterness sears off no less than 10 % of my tongue . this is a real palate crusher . seriously . i felt like beating up my girlfriend after the ass-whooping that was handed down to me . d : even though i do n't think this is particularly good beer , i applaud stone for their inventiveness , their goal and their execution . the 14th anniversary is exactly what a stone e ( i ) mperial ipa should be like . quite literally ."

S"guinness is simply one of those standard beers that the world is a better place for . its my safety beer . in the average bar filled with coors , bud light and mgd , you can almost always at least guinness nitro cans . i have come to depend on guinness in this way . when the pour is fresh , there is a wonderul thick head on the top of your beer . you should be able to draw in it or make little 'peaks ' on the head by dipping your finger in the beer . guinness does n't offer a variety or real depth of flavor , but never disappoints . its flavor hits almost immediately with hints of coffee dark bitter chocolate . i can drink guinness like chocolate milk - except in larger quantities ."

S'poured from 12 oz . bottle just like the one pictured into my clean , clear three philosophers snifter . purchased for something close to $ 1.99 at beers of the world in rochester , ny last october . date mentioned on bottle is that it is a limited bottling - winter 08-09 . a absolutely black body under a nice medium brown , milk chocolate head which lingered for a minute but then dissipated to a ring around the top of the glass . lacing is good as well and is of the milk chocolate color . the look can not be improved upon . s dark , dark malts and chocolate , exactly as i expected . of course , appropriate to the style as well . t one hell of a dark , big abv stout . i have to say the burn of alcohol hit me first followed quickly by the darkest of roasted malts . there is a minor hop presence imo . any chocolate is not seperable from the malt darkness . to me it is not an obvious chocolate like the st choklat might me . i am giving this a 4.5 , however , since the dark malt was so dark tasting that it was to the point of bitter ... it made me whince a little , even after it warmed a bit . m huge beer with kick of alcohol , deep dark malt and chocolate . d this is a one and done for me due to the abv , bigness . i think that this style notes : what a great beer as so very affordable compared to others in its style . a great beer from brooklyn . great job garret .'

S"poured into a pint glass a cloudy caramel color with an inch of tight , white head . i get a distinctly cardboard aroma upfront with some vanilla and holiday spice hidden in the back . the taste is better as the cardboard is less prominent . i 'm getting a sweet malt base with a nice blend of spice , vanilla , and toastiness . if not for the fact that the cardboard character sneaks up at the end , this could be a nice beer . mouthfeel is decent , but i still think this is overcarbonated like the other beers i 've tried from battered boar . overall , this is the best beer i 've had from this brewery to date . if not for the very evident cardboard character this beer would hold up very well to others in this style . the spicing is very well done in that it 's pleasant , subtle , and not in the least bit artificial tasting . they just need to clean up some of the off-flavors and maybe work with a yeast that 's better suited to bottle conditioning , as every beer i 've had from them is overly yeasty despite careful pours . blech ."

S"appearance - pours a very fluffy , hazed light lemon-yellow . enough foam to require a pause before the last ounce can be added . it looks good in the glass , nice effervescence , some notable thick ribbons of lace on the glass . one attractive blonde . aroma - a touch of lemon initially , lots of bread dough or cookie batter , or somewhere in between . the hops add an iced-tea herbal earthiness that makes for an unusual , intriguing sniff at first . with setup time , this becomes an odd , nearly offensive soapiness , maybe . or it 's a strong pilsnery wet grain/hop aroma , i ca n't tell , but it has an earthy manurish bend that is turning me off after a few minutes . taste - standard base of grain , what i notice off the bat is an unusual soap flavor , and a metal influence that is heavier than i care for . the hops come in clean on the swallow , but instead of accentuating the front side of the beer , they are in clean-up mode . in trying to cover the odd soapiness and metallic stuff , they get muddled in there . the aftertaste is bitter but flavorless from a hop standpoint . finishes dry , with an unpleasant mix of all aforementioned flavors . i do n't know if there is a bug in this bottle , but i do n't much like the taste . it 's also entirely possible that somehow the beer is just too rich for a blonde . indeed , the malts are not subtle , their graininess is pushy . and the hops , which should be on the light to medium side , are anything but . i 'll have to try this on-tap before making a final judgment on the blonde . mouthfeel - crisp , a note of fluffiness and also a note of smoothness . drinkability - this was far more of a chore than i wanted it to be . i wonder if there are some odd flavors in here as a result of the change over to the new bottling line , i.e . perhaps some of that 'new car smell ' getting into the beer 's taste in a bad way . whatever it is , i hope it goes away , as i really wanted to like and promote the local stuff , but i can not on this one ."

S'appearance is a brownish amber with a big white head . nice aroma , with fresh citrus hops and some underlying caramel malt . smelled like a some hopped up red ales , but flavor destroyed that comparison . sharp biting hops including the unmistakable herbal taste of summit hops . malt provides a nice , slightly sweet balance to the hops , but is light enough that this could easily be mistaken for an ipa . carbonation level is about medium with a lighter body and overall slick feel to it . typically im not a big fan of summit hops when theyre present in great enough quantities to be very noticeable ( gubna really tainted this hop for me ) , but town hall did a nice job with the blend here . seems to be just the combination where the summits provide some unique character but are tempered by more typical flavors of c-type hops . really enjoyed this one as did all whom i shared the growler with .'

S"( found my beer notebook , so now i can review this one . ) enjoyed at the bruery tasting room , the day after their 1st anniversary party . served in a bruery tulip glass . appearance : a good color for an old ale : ruddy brown with deep gold-amber highlights . hazy body . a thin , sticky head of foam the color of french vanilla ice cream reduces quickly to a patchy skin on the surface . does n't leave any lacing , but little pinpoints of foam remain . smell : huge sweet malt up front , with toffee and a light cheesiness like baked mozzarella on a pizza . underneath the malt there is a lot of dark , sweet fruit . raisins , figs , dates . peppery alcohol stings the nostrils . taste : huge sweet roasty malt tinged with concentrated raisin and pear flavors . caramel and medjool dates wrapped in burnt sugar . a drop of tart pear follows , along with a creamy nuttiness like tawny port . some bitterness at the very end . mouthfeel : syrupy , sticky , full and rich . carbonation , as expected , is low but suitable . prominent alcohol warmth . drinkability : not an easy one to drink . this is a heavy one , brother , and seriously hot . the rich and delicious flavors make it a classic slow-sipper , but the alcohol burn makes it a bit of a chore . time will hopefully take care of that burn . some barrel-aged character will make this beer incredible . i 'm glad i had a chance to try this version ."

S"appearance : looked good with a finger of tan head over an opaque black/brown brew . smell : roasted malt , subtle chocolate and coffee . not much in the cherry department . taste : right from the get go there is tart blast of cherries . not at all medicinal or cough syrup cherry , but the puckery tart cherries you 'd bake into a pie . overpoweringly tart at that . and lingering . after some of the cherry fades ( not much of it fades ) there is the underlying stout which is actually a decent light chocolately , roasted malt and coffee . mouthfeel : smooth and medium thick , low carbonation . drinkability : this is n't a bad beer . well , at face value this is really no different than adding lime juice to an adjunct lager for example bud lite lime , except that the addition of the fruit juice arguably improves the beverage . in bell 's case i just find the cherry extremely overpoweringly tart and lingering , downgrading slightly what was probably something along the lines of a kalamazoo stout-class beverage before grandma arrived and accidently dropped her basket of baking cherries into the aging barrel . i actually tried to clear my palate with a follow-up beer [ summit epa ] , but it was n't up to the task . the cherry lingered for *a long* time ."

S'this is a very clear light amber colored ipa with hues of orange around the edges . its head is a tall layer of white that laces and retains quite well . the aroma is full of citrus ( grapefruit and orange rinds ) and has a slight piney presence . the flavor has a surprising amount of malt to it , but it is still dominated by the hops . grapefruit and pine are very distinctive but it does remain balanced . the alcohol is noticeable , but does not take away from the flavor . mouth feel is medium in body and nicely carbonated , but the drinkability is hindered by its strong alcohol content . overall verdict : this is a very good beer , but the alcohol content mixed with the bottle size will keep me from getting this brew again .'

S"pangaea | 750 ml . | 7.0 % abv | 2009 vintage brewer : dogfish head craft brewery style : belgian strong pale ale glass : 22 oz . wine glass presentation : i like the map-like label . would have liked it corked ( it 's capped ) , but hey , i 'll take it . on the label : '' pangaea is the name of the supercontinent . before the land masses separated , we were all one happy family . our pangaea has a hint of ginger and great complexity , celebrating our communal history . best drunk cool , not cold , from a snifter or wine glass . | think globally , drink globally . | ages with the best of them . '' appearance : the moment it hits the glass , pangaea bursts into a seething sea of bubbles . but as it rises , it fills up nicely with a pleasant yellow-gold body girded by a wispy ring of microbubbles . is it just me or do the bubbles form into a continent -- a pangaea of sorts -- only to break apart ? good one dfh . aroma : peach , strawberry , raw steel , earthy notes , ginger . taste : i was really ready to have a bottle of this , and i can say i was n't disappointed . a faint white-wine flavor , tempered by spicy yeast is first , followed by a tart apple mid-body , finishing with light toast , ginger , and a hint of caramel/muscovado . the end is a bit cryptic -- definitely complex -- and i like that . overall , a very malty , not too hoppy , brew . mouthfeel : best served a touch on the colder side because the crisp carbonation really adds something nice . as it warms , it 's medium-bodied characteristics become more pronounced . harmony : i do n't know if i was just very eager for some beer , but i really enjoyed the experience . from the pour to an empty glass , it was a balanced and nuanced drink . would i get it again ? : yes , based on how much i enjoyed it as an experience . even so , it 's not the kind of drink you get as a staple -- definitely more of an occasion brew . bottled : 2009 served : august 25 , 2010 price = $ 9.99 @ whole foods ( bowery st . )"

S"in some ways , i 'm glad i bought this special edition pack before i read the ba reviews of its beers . this is a pretty terrible beer , but i 'm impressed at the attempt . more specifically ... appearance : i actually really dig the rich reddish brown of this beer . it 's unfiltered so pretty opaque . i did n't notice much lacing or head retention , but then , i do n't pay much attention to that anymore . smell : as another ba put it , i 'd hang this in my car . it smells sweet and malty , with a hint of the root beer flavors i 'm about to experience with its ... taste : in a word : cloying . in another word : overload . in lots of words : i have never tasted herbs and spices quite so `` distinctly '' in a beer . i can definitely pick out the mint and licorice flavors . it tastes like they used a whole pile of sassafrass parts to make this thing . no real indication of alcohol , but there 's definitely more to it than a standard root beer . the aftertaste is just ridiculous ; my breath feels like i ate licorice jellybeans until i puked and then chewed 6 packs of winterfresh to cover up the taste . mouthfeel : so-so . i do n't have much to say about this . not the best , but not the worst either . drinkability : never again . i did n't pour it out , though . do n't let all these negative reviews stop you from trying this , though : someone in boston thought this was worth selling , and this is bound to be someone 's favorite beer somewhere . just not me ... or my wife ... or anyone else i know ..."

S"bottle with a best before date of july 31 2007 a : poured with a very little head that died quickly and ended with a very subtle ring around the edge of the glass . very dull amber , to the point of slightly cloudy . s : very belgian dark fruit , sweet raisins , with a strong molasses . slight alcohol , similar to a cognac , but more earthy along the lines of a gin or almost subdued pimm 's . t : starts with a watered down maple syrup , the with a light bite of lemon/lime , with a lingering eraser molasses sweetness . there is a very subtle smoke throughout the taste , more so at the end . m : watery at first followed buy a surprisingly bubbly feel for the age of the beer . d : glad that i tried a rochefort 8 of this age ; but i think they are much better and way more enjoyable at a young , maybe six month , age . it was definitely worth the wait and experience to be able to try one this old . p.s . after adding the sediment there is a nice added body with a slight added doughy like texture , but still very subdued to the point of almost wateriness ."

S"cork pops out of a fresh bottle with almost no pop , and worries me . upon a vigarous pour , i find that this is well carbonated , and shows a clear golden orange color , with a thick two finger head . nice retention slowly makes way , leaving behind a blanket of foam and good lacing . aroma is quite spicy , both from yeast and from added spices . also has a slightly sugary aroma . no particular spice can be picked out of the aroma ( despite them being named on the label ) , but blend nicely into one another . flavor is very spicy and dry . good malt body up front , and the finish is heavily dominated by the spice , this time more from the added spices . sharp burn on the finish . no alcohol detected . becomes slightly more sweet as it warms . mouthfeel is heavy and full , with agressive carbonation . drinkability is good , when considering the alcohol . burn of the spice does drop the drinkability though ... that spicy burn lingers for quite some time . i 'm glad that i bought this bottle . in the past , i 'd had some negative experiances with corks from southhampton . this bottle had signs of slight leakage from the cork , but did not exhibit any off flavors . even though it is $ 12.50 , i 'd buy it agian ."

S'a tan/ruby pour ; a bit hazy . two finger head that reappears after a quick swirl . not sure this is a quadrupel , almost looks like a barley wine . smells like one , too . high alcohol in the nose . some sweet vanilla and caramel creep in , along with some fig and malt . taste is thin and full of alcohol . oak and vanilla dominate . caramel , malt , prune and biscuit come in waves . thin and filmy . does not finish clean one bit . again , this is a quadrupel ? ? if so , if fails to impress .'

S'this is the dead-on look for a pilsner ; pale straw color with steady streams of bubbles heading for the surface . the head is huge and sticky and clings to the side of the glass as if it were a life-or-death matter . the nose is fresh-cut hay and yeast with a musty quality more akin to garbanzo beans than beer . there is surprising hop bitterness here to compliment the yeast characteristics . a soft sweetness resonates in the finish , like a citrus sorbet in its subtlety . a really tasty pilsner . mouthfeel is almost perfect and this style , although usually unexciting , has always excelled in its drinkability and this is no exception .'

S"stopped by east end 's growler shop in the strips district 's public market to grab a growler of this one . poured into a tulip pint : pale yellow , much closer to the `` green-ish '' end of the spectrum than the `` orange-ish . '' transparent but hazy , with moderate nucleation & two fingers of soft , white head that drops to a thick but porous cap . leaves thick waves of lacing . smell is soft cereal , a little sweet , with a distinct tang . sweetness is like frosted mini-wheats , but taken down a few notches in terms of intensity . tang is slightly lemony , but not too strong . very surprised to be getting this much sweetness , but i like it . there we go ! moderate tartness up front in the taste , lemony , acidic , but not overwhelmingly so . some light cereal grains , mildly musty in a lager sort of way , a little mineral . nice dry finish & aftertaste , with some subdued citrus . taste has nowhere the sweetness that the aroma suggests . again , mouthfeel is moderately acidic at first , medium-light bodied that 's slightly viscous in the aftertaste . interesting that the tartness does n't really hang around , the aftertaste is pretty clean & not puckering like other , stronger sours . pretty refreshing . even though it does n't linger much , the tartness keeps this from being super-sessionable , though i could definitely see having a few at a time . sadly , i did n't get to try this at its debut at steel city big pour , so i was stoked to hear it would be offered at growler hours . this is n't a style we ever really see in these parts , at least in its pure form , so good on scott for continuing to aim for less common styles . edit : i originally said the tartness hampered this beer 's sessionability . that was my first , & after about 90 minutes i 'm on my fifth , so let 's bump that rating up a point , shall we ?"

S"on tap , this is a decent , but not great , lager . it 's dark gold with a small , faintly off-white head soon dissipating to a thin ring and leaving no lace . the aroma is light , somewhat musty grain , hint of vegetable , grass . the taste is light grain , a little musty , hints of cooked vegetable and plenty of cut green grass that has sat in the sun , hints of herb , apple peel , and , after the first couple sips , some mineral character . it has faint sweetness just dominated by light bitterness that lingers a little . it 's pretty easy to drink , fairly pleasant , somewhat tasty , but fairly basic with rather unimpressive character ."

S"17 hop varieties and 15 additions - that pretty much sums up this beast of the north shore . on-cask at the brewpub 6/16/05 : an emense yellowy froth of silky whipped proportions sits atop a beautifully cascading , up-running waterfall , creating an active orange sherbert along the top half before finally settling to its hibernating state of dark golden orange haze . big droppings and droopings of foam stick to the sides in stringy laced patterns as crumbles . keeps a largely set murk of milky cereal the whole way dwon the glass . umm ... it looks fuckin ' awesome ! hefty citrus aroma of peels all up in your face . tons of lemon , grapefruit , orange , tangerine , and tropical nuances create a lotion of creamy hop nectar thats fresher then fresh . big and leafy , sticky and resinous . lord have mercy on me for what 's to come ... holy hop juice batman ! this stuff is juic-sey ! big on the orange flavors with fluffy tangerine skins , dryish grapefruit , and one solid bite of bitterness from some interwoven pine sap and dry lime dust tartness . very complex when you get into it . beyond comprehension really . so many juicy things squeezing every ounce of flavor out of the hops its ridiculously mind boggling and hop heavenly pleasing . the malts are there ; toasted and raw with a bit of a husk associated breadyness . touches of nuts and oatmealy sweetening too . but this is way before , and in non essentail details to what the hops bring to the table . loved the orange/lime tang and tartness this created as it surged across the tongue . juicy and hoppy , big , and favorably brash in all its glory with a massive warm body of full stature . billowing with eagerness to fulfill every citrus you 've ever encountered and in its freshest way . oh my was this stuff amazing ! so damn good but hard to pass through the throat . wow , there 's alot to take in here . this stuff really raises the eyebrows and slows the mind . it took a good long while to finish a full pint , but it was worth every minute . something i 've grown accustomed to now with these hop brutes at fitger 's ."

S"appearance : extremely pale yellow , perfect clarity . looks like yellowish water . smell : nothing really makes an impression ; some light , husky grain is all that 's there . taste : somewhat dry , and very crisp . thin grain , a little cereal-like . it seems like they 're trying to mimic heineken and other eurolagers with the taste . they got the dry , lightly tanniny taste right , but there 's no body to it . almost no malt flavor , either . it tastes like grassy club soda . verdict : do n't bother . you might as well put the beer down and drink a pepsi instead ; the pepsi will have more flavor ."

S"this beer opens with a strong cranberry wash and finishes with an odd mix of the tart cranberry and heavy saccharine of the molasses . it 's certainly enojyable enough , but has trouble deciding whether or not it wants to be a dessert beer . a good choice for the occasional seasonal 6-pack , but not something i 'd pick up on a regular basis ."

S'pored from 12oz to immperial pint , seems kind of wimpy in this glass . pours a dark ruby red topped with a beige one finger head , good lacing . smell is definatively of pumpkin and the spice that intrinsically goes with it , nutmeg . also sweet dark malt , black strap molasses , buttery . very on point . taste is of carmelized pumpkin pie , you know the top of the pie that stayed just long enough under the broiler to brown . some light coffee is in there as well , nutmeg is in the background but there . feel is definately the weak point of the brew , way too thin . add some flaked oats or something . drinkability is great , could see myself having this for many years .'

S"received via trade from mcduck . thanks a bundle for sending this ! enjoyed with my fiance who was looking forward to this all week ... appearance : pours an uber-hazy yellowish orange with a solid finger of white head , and a nice fizzy noise emanating from it indication the carbonation definitely made it through the trip . a little bit of yeast settled in the bottom of the bottle , but a quick swirl added it to the glass . the head quickly dissipates leaving a white ring around the edge of the glass and a look that is semi-reminiscent of orange juice . smell : mango , orange , lemon , yeast , and some farmhouse funk as well . definitely expecting some sour notes based on the nose . taste : definitely got the tang that i was expecting . mango , grapefruit , and orange highlight the front end . some yeast and a tinge of malt round out this yummy summer beer . mouthfeel : exceedingly carbonated . crisp , yet a little sticky as well . i ca n't help drawing a small comparison to a carbonated orange juice . drinkability : for a summertime libation , this beer definitely fits the mold . my fiance was n't crazy about the sourness , but i kind of dig it . at 5 % abv , a few glasses of these would make for a nice afternoon in the shade . glad i could get this for us to sample . highly worth it !"

S"thanks to evan1023 for this one . 75cl bottle poured into a duvel tulip . bottle date read 'bottled in 2009' it pours a hazy golden orange with a 3 finger pillowy frothy head . minimal lacing ran down the glass as it emptied . at first whiff i 'm getting some nutmeg and clove smells but when i stick my whole nose in i 'm getting a distinct chai tea smell . it seems like a great marriage of malty sweet beer and black tea . taste is just like someone mixed in some chai tea with a light crystal malt heavy base beer . i 'm also picking up some orange taste . i 'm not sure if this is from any citrus hops or if they used orange peel in the process . it finishes a little too sweet . it is very full bodied malty spicy beer . the drinkability suffers from how spiced and heavy it is . i drank the whole 75cl but was rather tired after the first half . i am a chai tea lover and average about one a day so i really was looking forward to trying this beer . it does satisfy me in that the flavor components are there but i was kind of wishing for a more bold tea flavor from something coming from dfh . i am glad i tried it and enjoyed it but would recommend having no more than about 8oz . at a time . after that it becomes too filling and kind of a chore to drink ."

S"where to begin ? probably not appropriate for me to rate this beer given the vast array of quality , non-mass-produced beers i 've had in the past , but i am anyway because the fact that this beer is rated so highly on this site offends me . i realize ba tends to rate things higher on average than other sites but i would hope people would recognize a medicore beer when they see it . whatever this beer used to taste like , whatever it used to be , it is now a mass-produced , overhyped product . a : a deceptively nice appearance . dark amber with a half inch head i had to try for . looks decent enough . s : it smells like ... beer , i suppose . it does n't smell bad , but there 's not too much of an aroma to it at all , certainly nothing that will fill up the room . t : i 'm sorry , but in my opinion , samuel adams boston lager is water . there , i said it . i purposely saved myself and went straight for this stuff so my palate would not be contaminated with any ipa 's , or , frankly , good beer , and this stuff still tasted like water . it 's not even that there 's a subtle , complex flavor , flat-out , there 's barely any hops in this beer , and the hops that are in it went towards making it overly bitter with no other flavors to support the bitterness . the result is an imbalanced , bitter beer that tastes like nothing . m : what am i supposed to feel ? there 's nothing there . d : very drinkable . after all , there 's almost nothing there ."

S'its not merely that this oatmeal stout is bad . its astonishingly bad . it catches me off guard with its badness . its difficult for me to recall ever drinking a stout this awful . i like the way the tight nitro foam stays afloat with such structure that even five minutes after i put the glass down , the head still frames the absence where my lips pressed down upon it . and the aroma is fine a touch of chocolate . but the taste is tortuous . it tastes like both the fire and the fire extinguisher . like the aftereffects of a four-alarm blaze . like charred embers . like something scraped from the barbeque grill . in truth , i couldnt drink more than half the pint . it is uncommonly bad .'

S"this beer is probably my alltime favorite from the herkimer . it is served in separate glasses with the `` neutral '' white beer in one and then your choice of `` mix-in '' in the other . i ordered two since my wife and i were there together and since there were two `` flavoring '' options . there was a glass of raspberry and a glass of `` woodruff '' or apple that came on the side for combining in various strengths . i tried the neutral beer independent of the flavorings first and it had a mildly cloudy appearance . it was pretty white with no real head , but did have a nice rim of foam around the edge of the glass . the attack was mild , but did have a stong `` grapey '' or mildly citrus flavor . it would be decent on its own . the rapsberry was a nice complement in that it cut some of the bite that was present in the stand alone beer with the sweetness of the berries . the woodruff changed the flavor in a much more drastic way . the beer took on tones that were very similar to a hard cider , and it seemed to grow very complex with the initial flavors of the beer still floating around the glass and in the mouth . this beer was probably much more fun to drink than anything else . i have to give it a 5 for drinkability because it totally allowed me to `` geek out '' on the drinking of it and it was gone before you knew it . the appearance is highly rated because when they bring out several glasses , its an impressive thing . the appearance of the beer itself was decent , but the presentation was tremendous and that is what appearance is really all about , is n't it ? i do n't know if you can still get this there or not , but if you can . . . you must . if anyone from herkimer reads this . . .you should make it a permanent menu option . its a lot of fun ."

S"10-13-2003 sorry everybody , but i do n't like this beer . i hope i move it down in the rankings ( edit : damn i did n't ) because it made me mad . maybe its just an off night or something for me , but this beer really is no good ! i 'll admit the nose is quite nice , huge citrus hops cascade and centennial i would venture , with a hint of yeastyness and ethanol there . the taste is huge , its too huge . its not interesting , it simply rumbles over your tongue . this beer crosses the line . it seems like an excuse to make a stupidly big beer . dfh 90 min is what i think an iipa should taste like ... big but interesting and doing something other than gouping up my mouth . this beer is cloyingly sweet , extremely sweet . i think a really hoppy beer should be balanced with maltiness , not sugar . my mouth is now coated with a resinous shalack like syrup godammit ! i hate that . the hops and alcohol ( which is really obvious in this disaster of a beer ) are giving me bad heartburn and i spilled it on my nice leather chair and it was a sticky fucking mess ! all in all , i say tone it down . i could n't drink another one of these if i had to . 2-20-2005 update well ... i had to give it another shot after my horrible experience last year . it it 's on 7 $ a bomber here which is cheaper than the 10 $ i was told to expect . i just have to say that it was n't my mood or a bad bottle or anything . i hated the beer this time and had to move the mouthfeel rating down to 2.0 . this stuff is like barely liquid cotton candy . blech . it is so syrupy . i have to say that the american hop flavors are incredible , but far far too much . it tastes like they found out how to artificially synthesize american hop flavors and they poured a gallon of these chemicals into each bottle . well this is certainly a technical achievement , it makes horrible beer . but do have to praise the lacing . really impressive ."

S"12oz bottle . bottled the last week of dec. 09 a- a slightly darker amber than the last hop project . almost 2 fingers of white head , heavy lacing . s- typical citrus notes and pale malts but this beer has twist to it . i ca n't really pick out what it is . almost reminds me of a rye beer or possibly even a saison like the guy below me said . interesting but it seems a little off . t- this beer is a really big change from the previous hop projects . i hope when they come to six packs they will print a little info with each one , as this is a rather unique ipa . far from a hop bomb . it reminds of terrapin 's rye pale ale . mellow with a mellow dry finish . maybe even a little tart/sourness in the finish . nothing is unpleasant , though . a lighter refreshing ipa m- slightly thin , ample carbonation . makes for a crisp , slightly dry finish . d- a very easy drinking ipa . the hop projects are a deal at around $ 1.50 per bottle ."

S'presentation : bomber . single label wraps the main body . dark green background hosts an oval which contains a portrait of joshua lawrence chamberlain . color coded dark blue , red & white crown cap . the reverse of the label describes the background to the referenced chamberlain , which is useful because as a brit i never even heard of the dude . described as a pale ale , no strength or freshness date listed . appearance : darkened copper amber body with a lovely crystal lucidity . decent sized creamy vanilla colored head that rises quickly and forms a nice finger thick head . rolling carbonation with minimal lacing . nose : well there the good start comes to a grinding halt . this one has a strange nose on it . it smells cold , chilled and stark , like frozen food that is well past its best before date.you pull it out of the back of the freezer and it has that stinky odor which is repressed , you know its off , but the low temperature is polite in restraining the degree of how bad this one really is . mild sweet toffee malts and some caramel blend with bubble bath and soapy tit wanks..not good . taste : right out of the stalls this one is extremely bland when chilled , in short it sucks . nothing more than watered down iced-tea , and not even liptons at that ! ! ! the aftertaste reminded me of the feeling of quickly eating an ice pop ( i think that is popsicle in the us ) . freezer burn on the tongue with a shimmering hint of flavor . defrosted flavors are not much better . hints of lemon and tannins as it warms , but the flavors are shockingly flaccid . mouthfeel : insipid , slack , loose , thin and watery ... it is just like iced tea in fact . erm.yep , thats it . drinkability : a libational anal glaucoma..i.e . i just dont see my ass drinking this one last third was a drain pour . shockingly easy to stick down the drain . overall : when i fist picked this one up , being a brit , i knew not of joshua lawrence chamberlain , the civil war hero , moreover i thought of an engrained infamous black & white image of the then uk prime minister neville chamberlain alighting an aircraft waving a piece of paper , the paper was his shambles of an effort to stave off ww2 , namely the munich agreement . joshua lawrence chamberlain was a man of action it seemed , a fighter , as deserved hero - neville chamberlain was a sad pathetic excuse of a leader , a weak and wishy-washy stand-in who wanted to avoid conflict at all costs..thankfully the uk ditched neville chamberlain in may 1940 , just in time for he was ill-defined , weak and way'

S"got this on tap the other day at the times bar and grill . the selection was limited , and i remembered enjoying this beer a few years ago before my taste starting leaning towards ipas and tripels . i can see why i liked this beer more than most of the macros at the time , but i was slightly disappointed at this beer . a bud american ale is a better choice if you can make it , but killian 's irish red may be the best on tap when you go out sometimes . it poured decently enough : an average sized head with minimal lacing and a clear red color . the smell was weak , but nothing unpleasant . largely based off a light caramel smell with alcoholic aromas in the background . the taste is n't much more . it 's a very weak beer with a sweetness to it . it is also overcarbonated and quite watery . it 's quite drinkable due to its low alcohol content ( and the fact that there is nothing bad about this beer ) , but it still lacks the quality factor many are looking for . i 'd only get this beer if its the best available on tap when i go out . even still , sometimes i might just pass ."

S"tasted january 18th , 2009 . pours pale yellow color and a little hazy . smell is a little bit repulsive which is due to the absynthe , i would guess . absinthe is a aromatic plant that is known to be very bitter . taste is not so bad , however , there is acidic taste and the beer is very bitter in a strange way . not the typical bitterness found in very hoppy beer . this is not a bad beer , but the strange is so ... well strange ... that the drinkability is not very high . moreover , the price is high for this beer which does n't help ."

S'nice golden color , with a small but sustaining head . the aroma is nice and fruity , i get hints of tropical fruits , oranges and apples . it also has slight hints of a malt characteristic , though definitely not roasted malts . the taste is good , but leaves a lot to be desired . decent bit of hops with the bread like character of malt . the most prominent flavor is orange rind . but i feel like this is missing something to make it complete , like possibly a sweeter fruity note . the finish is the orange rind just fading away slowly . the mouth feel also leaves quite a bit to be desired , the carbonation is there but it all tastes rather acidic . which leads to the drinkability . this beer is nice and refreshing , but the whole time i feel like its stripping away at my mouth .'

S"this beer poured a nice reddish-dark brown , almost a winelike colour , with a very robust , 2 finger ( or even more ! ) toasty head . really nice . the smell was muted , a bit soapy , brown sugars and light hops with alcohol and ripe red fruit . the taste was more of the same but expressed a bit better , with strong caramel notes , spiciness and more of that ripe red fruit with a light hoppy balance . the mouthfeel was alright ... thinner and a little bit oilier than i 'd expected , and too `` hard '' in the mouth . smooth , though . the drinkability was not great . lots of alcohol showing through the flavours ... a good beer to taste and try , but probably not going to be a go-to brew ."

S"750ml bottle poured into a pilsener glass . a : pours out a light , slightly chill hazed peachy brown , looks a little bit like iced tea , especially with the thin and wispy cap of sandy white head that tops this beer . head fades into a ring rather quickly , no lacing , but a decent amount of carbonation showing through in some slowly rising ropes . s : if it did n't look like a dopplebock it certainly smells like one ; loads of rich , sweet malt dominate the nose , it 's a thick , biscuity , almost caramel covered dinner roll kind of doughiness . t/mf : slightly peppery/herbal kind of spiciness to it on top of a thick layer after layer of maltiness . bits of honey brushed sweetness here and there play together with a slightly boozy sweet dryness . feels much lighter than the abv would indicate , an almost effervescent , bubbly kind of feel , fills the mouth on every sip then becomes a bit chewier as the bubbles subside on the tongue . there is a lightness in taste , that is , a lively , crisp kind of sweetness , not a lingering , slick , sticky kind of sweetness that say , samiclaus has , but then again this beer is about half the size of that beer . i guess what i am trying to get at here is an underlying kind of fruitness displayed by this beer , it really plays well with the peppery/ sweet/ doughy aspects of this beer and adds a certain character to the beer that i am really thoroughly enjoying at the moment . d : offff this beer may feel light on the tongue but it packs quite a punch in the stomach . through one glass and really wish i had a friend to share the rest of this bottle with ."

S'pours a hazy pinkish brown , with a medium off-white head . smell is of cranberry . pretty basic . taste is super sweet , cranberry juice , and a grainy wheat flavor as well . a hint of bitterness in the finish . none of the mouth puckering dryness you would get from a real lambic . i *think* i detect a tiny hint of funk , but its so small it might as well not even be there . hardly spontaneously fermented . mouthfeel is decent , low carbonation . drinkability is the worst part . the aftertaste is horrid , which isnt a problem though until you get near the end of the glass . this is also not a lambic , its a cranberry wheat beer . tastes a lot like sam adams cherry wheat , but with cranberry flavor instead , and not quite as sweet . the beer isnt bad , but i suspect it wouldnt get blasted in the ratings as much if they labeled it what it was , a flavored wheat beer .'

S"this review covers the 3.2 % abw ( 4 % abv ) oklahoma version . it looks very average for the style : sudsy head that dissipates to a ring aroung the glass . pale yellow . nothing too sad or impressive . smells ( and tastes ) of corn syrup tainted with malt extract . a hop character designed for people that ask `` what 's a hop ? '' not too bad , but then again not exceptional . tastes like a beer that leans on adjuncts too much but is not too nasty either . this beer is a notch above the other beers in it 's price class on the shelf in oklahoma . mouthfeel is average and it is easy to guzzle when it is ice cold and you want a cheap thrill -- or you are on a strict budget like i am right now . judging from reviews from less opressive regimes ( states ) the added water in the 3.2 version actually may help the flavor ."

S"served on-tap @ flying saucer , kansas city , into a samuel adams perfect pint glass pours a rich shade of caramel with a two-finger white head . the lacing was particularly nice ; not webby or sinewy but simply straight rings and notches around the glass . is it the perfect pint glass ? i do n't know , but it is pretty nonetheless . the aroma , despite the perfect pint glass supposedly boosting this department , was lacking somewhat . there was a strong element of noble hops and great deal of biscuit . perhaps a kiss of honey at its best . this is a darn-drinkable beer no matter what anyone tells me because of its taste . smooth , slightly-sweet malt mingles with a generous portion of german ( hallertau ) hops . the noble hops can get a tiny bit sour after a while , however . it is not complex by any stretch of the imagination . but it is easy-drinking , sweet , bready and hoppy . you ca n't go wrong drinking a boston lager ( though you can assuredly go better ) . the lager thinness carries the day , letting the noble hops shine all throughout the drink . at such a low abv and with a decently high amount of flavor , one can definitely session this beer . i myself would rather pick up a locally-brewed beer to session ( for me : the similarly-flavored boulevard pilsner or another boulevard year-round product ) but this should do quite nicely for many people as an accessible , go-to lager ."

S"12oz bottle with a date of jan 07 2011 - do n't know if that is best by or bottled on . poured into a shaker pint glass . appearance : clear orange-copper beer with a off-white head . some tints of pink mixed in with the orange when held up to the light . poured a 1/4 '' head initially , but this died down to a ring and a persistent film across the top . some strands and islands of lacing noted . lots of bubbles coming up through the beer . smell : when first poured , nothing but bourbon whiskey . as it warms up the bourbon still dominates , but hints of caramel and some berry-like fruitiness come out as well . i 'm a fan of bourbon , but this is kind of odd . taste : bourbon whiskey taste and bit right up front , moving into some sweeter caramel and toffee flavors . toasted/roasted malt coming right behind the sweeter flavors and then something of a sudden , but very mild , bitterness , and then it smooths out with more sweetness and bourbon flavors . this beer is indeed very whiskey like , it even has a bit of the bourbon alcohol bite present - it 's not as hidden as you think it would be . the overall taste is well on the sweet side and i think you would need to be a whiskey fan to really appreciate this one . mouthfeel : mild carbonation on the tongue despite all the bubbles coming up , which is good , as too much carbonation would get in the way here . slick beer that coats the whole mouth and sticks to the teeth a bit . drinkability : this is a hybrid of a whiskey and a beer . the bourbon flavors dominate , but the toasted and roasted malts come through and do add something nice to the whole beer . but ... this beer really only has one flavor , and that 's bourbon whiskey , and it 's not an outstanding whiskey at that . which means this is a sipper for me and one at a time for me as well . i can not see myself having more than one an evening . still , interesting brew and glad i tried it , but it 's just okay and if i really want whiskey , i 'll pour myself some proper kentucky bourbon into a glass over ice and enjoy . i think with some more depth of profile where the bourbon flavors are complimenting , rather than dominating , the beer - would be preferred . of course - the bourbon is the point of this beer is n't it ? so maybe i 'm just not a fan and i 'll leave it at that ."

S"thanks to the wonderful folks at de struise , i was able to try a beer i only thought was available through that horrible auction site at a very pretty penny . but for just around $ 10 this gem was shipped to my house straight from the brewery ! thanks so much , struise ! into the snifter , this beer is a beauty to behold . it 's pitch black with one of those rocky belgian heads that every brewer should strive for . just incredible head retention and lace , this is a perfect looking double/impy stout . smell is nice , lots of bourbon and coffee . malt is sweet and gives some caramel and sugar notes . just a hint of noticeable alcohol is well covered by the freshness of the coffee beans and dark chocolate . some noticeable bitterness as well , this beer is complete , extreme and well constructed . taste is nice , but i think a few american coffee/bourbon stouts do a better job of integrating the bourbon and barrel . coffee is actually more subdued that i thought - it 's there , but gets hidden in the roast . the malt is roasted , scratch that . burned and gives dark chocolate notes . there 's some oak and bourbon . what i 'm missing is a smoother edge , like some vanilla or sweet malt to balance . this is good but not exceptional . the mouthfeel , however , is . the carbonation is active but comes across as lush and inviting , never too sharp and biting . the body is creamy and smooth . for a 13 % , this has that lighter milkshake feeling that few can pull off . no syrup feel at all , thick and smooth , with slight lingering stickiness and roast . i would drink this again in a heartbeat . and , as i worked my way down the snifter , it became more inviting . this was sampled with black mes and cuvee delphine , and , while delphine probably scored a touch higher , this was in a photo finish to be the best of the bunch ."

S'this wheat beer from germany is a very pale yellow offering with a very short crown leading to a very thin ring . the body is a medium and the carbonation is very light . the added cloudiness to this product makes it a very unappealing brew to look at , let alone consume . the nose is lightly yeasty . the taste is very sweet and lingering . i did not enjoy this brew ... nor is it close to my favourite style ... others think highly of it .'

S"this beer is harsh , dry and somewhat bitter . its definitely not the better beers from the flying dog arsenal . at best this is a mediocre pale ale . there are much better options out there . even on tap , this one did n't deliver very well . i will be hard pressed to choose this one again . i was at a local restaurant with this one , coors and miller on draft so i figured to support the local brewery . sorry i can promote this one further though ."

S'this is my go-to beer when other choices fail.. poured from a 12oz bottle , ive also had this from a tap , and a can . apperance- a warm amber color with a thin white head that dissapates quickly . smell- not too much going on , some hops poking through . taste , mouthfeel- well balanced with the hops and malt , not bitter not sweet . medium carbonation and body to this beer . drinkability- good overall american lager , good tasting , looking , and decently priced .'

S"poured from bottle into goblet . a : good thick creamy head that fades slowly , pitch black color n : nose has alcohol right out front surprisingly , some oats and raosted malts , stout like qualities t : taste is kinda chalky and chocolatey , like powdered chocolate , reminds me of the nestle powedered chocolate milk , some creaminess with oats , strong stout flavors in the middle with some roasted malts , very bold taste , very dry taste though , almost makes your mouth dry so much its makes it harder to drink m : creamy and rich with good carbonation f : more of that really dry chalky taste and huge stout bitterness that makes it almost unpalatable final thoughts : i 'm somewhat surprised by this . maybe it was an older bottle . i remember this beer being one of my favorite oatmeal stouts before , but this one is a little tougher to drink . i think i 'll have to come back and try it again another time. , or maybe i 'll have to try it in winter and not a hot summer day ."

S'i have been looking forward to trying this beer since i first heard about it . it finally arrived here in gainesville , fl . poured into a small tulip glass lighter in color than i expected . given the chocolate nibs & peppers i thought it would be darker . i couldnt reallly taste much of the pepper however my wife could right away . she didnt drink it straight from the bottle though . the more i had the more i could taste the heat of the pepper & the chocolate.but neither were overpowering . honestly it reminded me of the midas touch only a little stronger . i enjoyed it & would buy it again .'

S"on-tap at beachwood bbq , in seal beach , ca , a : pours a amber/red colour , small white head as well , good retention in the glass , leaving a small colony of bubbles overhead as the beer is drunk . s : toffee , caramel malt , with some citrus - most notably , grapefruit and lemon . t : beer was a little cool coming out of the tap , so i originally thought , `` that 's it ? '' but as the beer warmed , a nice combination of malt and hops came out . the malt had a nice biscuity , toasty flavour to it typical of red ales , the hops were tasty , very fresh , with some pine resin , citrus , and soil . m : fresh and crisp , great carbonation level , which only enhances the beer 's flavours , is not overdone , resiny , but not overly oily , even with the fresh hops . d : this is my second fresh hop beer ever , so i do n't know what to make of them yet , but i like what i 've tried so far . on drinkability , i found this beer incredibly refreshing , the bitterness was not overpowering , at first i thought it would be at about ipa level , but it 's really closer to a pale ale . i classified this as an amber/red , but it is close to a pale ale too , so it could have been classified in either , i just went with what the colour , and malt and hop profile told me . in conclusion , this is another great beer by moonlight , pretty rare , so if you find it on-tap or on-cask , you should definitely try it ."

S'roomie found this for $ 1.50 a bomber at alberstons awile back . poured from a bomber into an ice cold mug . average copper in appearance . seems a little thin . there a nice frothy eggshell color head . pretty decent lacing start to finish . nothing to brag about though . smell is kind of weak with a bit of hops and a slight hint of grapfruit . taste is thin . smooth start with a thick malty finish . aftertaste retains the funky malt leaving you with a dry throat . this beer was a good deal for what we got it for and i wouldnt mind buying more at the same price . theres nothing fancy about it although its a good drinkable beer . i doubt ill see it win any awards anytime soon .'

S"i bought this beer because it sounded unique . it definitely lived up to my expectations . it was like a wild ale ... sour , a bit sweet , and had a distinct wine-ish flavor . i would describe it as being between a wine and a beer . it was n't overly carbonated , which added to the mouth feel of this medium heavy beer . i would n't drink more than one or two of them . i do n't know if i can peg this beer into a category , but would definitely recommend to those more adventurous drinkers ."

S'served on tap at monks cafe in philadelphia in a flare pilsner glass . deep red body with a thin lacy head . the aroma is intense to say the least . the description written on the beer list stated the you could smell this from across the room when it is poured , which does not seem like an exaggeration . the smell of sweet raspberries simply radiates out of the glass . flavor is of sweet , syrupy raspberries . there is a balance between a slightly sour fresh fruit flavor and a much sweeter element almost like a raspberry pie filling . mouthfeel is like champagne , really the only way to describe it . as for drinkability , the sweetness hinders it a bit . if it were to lean a bit more to the sour it could be much more drinkable .'

S"a - hazy , burnished yellow-gold . frothy , thick off-white head . carbonation looks light . s - hmm . seems a bit subdued . some juicy fruit and grassy hop character . light malt character in the background . what 's there smells good , but it 's pretty subdued . t - okay , things are getting a bit better . the same juicy , tropical fruit character carries over here . it 's difficult to describe . kind of like sugared grapefruit and canned peaches . there 's also some grassy hop flavor in the finish . however , that said , it 's still strangely subdued . and i do n't mean just hop character , because as with the nose , the malt is barely evident , providing just a bit of light sweetness for the backbone . i 'm not getting any crystal malt , so i wonder if some other specialty grain is backing the hops to give them that unique flavor . mf - the carbonation is n't very high , giving some it some body . it 's fine , but nothing special . d - at 7 % , sculpin is pretty average in the alcohol department , but it drinks incredibly easy . it 's a very delicate beer , with complex flavors that leave me wanting a whole growler to myself . i did n't expect it , but i ca n't imagine giving it anything other than a five here ."

S"pours with a deeply reddish tinged , copper color that is just about brilliantly clear . the head is frothy , a lightly amber tan color that is initially two fingers thick . the aroma is marred by an amplified diacetyl note . this note is dominant , but ca n't hide the citrusy hop ( predominantly grapefruit ) components and the biscuit-like caramelized malt notes . the aroma is not totally ruined , but it would be quite a bit nicer without the butter bomb . this beer is lightly sweet with a bitterness that bitingly grabs the tongue from the get go . herbal hop notes linger with menthol-like notes , both of which are a bit more dominant than the typical citrus hop notes . citrus notes are here in the form of grapefruit and orange zest though . the malt is buried here , but still noticeable as biscuit flavors , toasted grain notes and a hint of , hop complimenting , caramelized sweetness . i havent mentioned the d-word yet , but that is because it is a given at this point . it finishes the beer off as the most notable component , though , thankfully , it does not drown out all of the other flavors , but it does impact and mar the flavor profile . even with the diacetyl it is just drinkable , with out it though , i am sure it would be quite tasty"

S"i was very surprised with this offering . pouring it into a pint glass revealed a decent , rocky head with nice lace , and a dark mahogany color with a nice coffeeish , roasted nose . the taste was classic porter : lightly malty and roasty with maybe a hint of toffee followed by a nice , mellow hop-bitter finish . the mouth feel was n't as chewy as expected but this shortcoming is easily overcome by the other well done attributes . at 6.5 % a nice warmth permeated the mouth and throat . this is pretty decent beer and i would definitely buy this again and again ... do not confuse a porter with a stout and you 'll be impressed with this brew . kudos to the genesse errr ... high falls gang ! ! !"

S"i was pretty excited to find a bottle of this laying around at the root cellar in cincinnati , oh . i looked for it a couple of times around it 's release date and nothing ... lo and behold , i find it when i 'm looking for something else . review is from notes taken on 5/14/2011 and poured from the bottle to a snifter . appearance : pours a thick , viscous coffee black and it starts with a scant 1/4 finger dark brown head that fades immediately to nothing other than a pencil thin ring around the surface and two small islands floating around the surface ; body is entirely opaque , and i 'm not sure if there is going to be any carbonation present or not based upon the looks of it ; a couple of strands and spots of lacing are left behind , but not much to speak of ; there is a bit of an oily coating that lingers after each sip , but then falls back into the drink . smell : wow . big chocolate , right up front , and it ranges from a syrupy sweet hershey-style scent to a more semi-sweet chocolate covering dark cherries ; hints of vanilla ; dark roasty malts , like spent espresso grains and a definite big blast of alcohol ; nose is strong and robust ... awesome ! taste : holy crap -- just like it smells , nearly to a `` t. '' lots of big sweet syrupy chocolate and a blended semi-sweet chocolate , and those sweet and slightly tart ripe cherries ; a vanilla sweetness , like the syrup in a chocolate covered cherry rings through ; strong roasted malts , like the ones in the smell , they 're very much like spent espresso or other strong roast ; big alcohol that is a little bit like bourbon -- it starts out a little hot , but really mellows as the drink sits and fades more to a warming presence . mouthfeel : thick and viscous in the mouth , just like it looked on the pour -- this body is heavy , just like i would hope ; a thick and sticky coating is left all over the mouth , and it is just a little bit gritty ; gums are left tingly , and the belly is left quite warm from the abv that clocks in at over 11 % . a great mouthfeel to this one , you definitely know you 're drinking a big thick stout . goose island nailed this one . overall : this beer is fantastic , easily one of the best stouts i 've had in quite a while . while it 's heavy and the abv is high , i would be more than happy to sip on this all night ."

S"appearance : short-lived chunky head atop a pretty body . the hazy yet transparent straw color illuminates many tiny particles floating around . smell : strong jam and candy aroma . i 've never had boysenberries so i would have guessed blueberry and a little bit of strawberry . taste : very nice fruit profile in the taste . the fruitiness is intense but i can also taste a good crisp wheat ale behind it . again it seems like blueberries to me and reminds me of the beer from beer works with all the blueberries in the glass . some points off at the end for a lingering medicinal aftertaste in the back of my throat . mouthfeel : zesty and a little chewy , compliments the beer well . drinkability : i 'm delighted to have one , two would be okay , three and i might start to feel like the girl from willy wonka . beef notes : congrats to the brewer . one of the better beers of its kind ."

S"i just tried this with lunch at the fabulous sun singer in champaign , and it was a wonderful accompaniment to my reuben and salad . the appearance is very good , with two full fingers of white foam capping a cloudy lemon body . the smell exudes good malt , some yeast , and overtures toward fruit that the taste realizes well . with a smooth , easy texture , the fruit shines through well -- orange , banana , lemon -- as does the malt . this is highly refreshing , and i can only imagine that this would be every bit the equal of a splendid hefe weizen in beating the heat in summer . having another of these would have been a breeze . very fine beer , and goes with a lot of food . it 's an easy partner for any meal . do n't miss ."

S"pours a pale gold color into the pilsner glass . lots of bubbles , 3 finger head , strong lacing , not a hint of haze nor sediment . exactly how a beer ought to look . smells of lightly toasted malts and that dank earthy musty smell of noble hops . taste is clean , simple . all the notes are there : mild bitterness , a dry finish , that earthy hop thing again ; but quite subtle , even at a slightly warmer temperature . just a hint of that sulfuriness people often mistake for `` skunk . '' mouthfeel is light , effervescent , tiny bubbles , no stickiness at all . very easy to drink far too quickly ; have to remember to sit back and enjoy !"

S"pours a hazy golden color with a pure white head that settles into a solid ring . nice banana aroma , with some clove and bubblegum as well . not much else to say , spot on . the taste starts off with a lemony tartness which is followed by a candied banana flavor and some grains . a bit too sugary and not enough of the yeasty phenols but decent bavarian hefe taste . light to moderate body with fizzy carbonation . feels a tad thin for the style . the hefe drinks very easy and is fairly crisp . good beer to drink outdoors while grilling food . worth a try but it wo n't blow you away ."

S"appearance a bright sun blazed amber orange haziness forms in my imperial pint glass , thick off white head forms thick floating above the body after quite the vigorous pour . ample even intricate lacing sticks to the sides of my glass as it dwindles . aromatics offer up sweet bubblegum colliding with pungent honey accents very floral and nectar like sweetness . sharp wheat accent does offer up just a touch of citrus quality among the waves of honey , labeled as a wheat wine i would suggest some sort of mead , to me it 's more in line with something like dfh 's midas touch . alcohol is evident but pretty well blended among the bursts of honey with a touch of white grape skins left behind . flavor is a bit cloying with biscuit malts drizzled with honey and wheat sharpness , powdered yeast takes an effect as well just adding a level of chalkiness that i do n't really care for . honey and caramelized green apples and white grape tartness are ample here , a bit of over ripened banana all soaked in pretty lively alcohol . mouthfeel is pretty much syrup , watered down honey texture . it really clings to your palate along with a soothing alcohol burn , definitely not the smoothest heavy hitter i 've ever sipped on . in fact it becomes a job to finish off one of these , full bodied with all kind of residual alcohol . drinkability is okay in moderation , not a beer that you will enjoy in number . i liked the flavors but the mouthfeel and alcohol did weigh me down a bit , i guess that 's wheat wine . i do think some hop bitterness would have rounded out this experience so much , like marin 's version ."

S"someone once told me that keystone light is just coors light reject beer . i did n't actually believe him because the logistics of that do n't make sense - i imagined some guy who takes a sip from every can , and is like `` label this one keystone ! '' in all fairness , the two seem almost identical , except kegs of keystone are 20 dollars cheaper where i live . therefore , it was the beer of choice at my house for a while . on the actual beer : it tastes like nothing , it is cheap , and it is easy to chug . it is heavily carbonated , so a minute after chugging it your stomach will bloat . if you are not in college or high school never buy this beer ."

S'750ml bottle poured into a standard pint glass . appearance- clear golden , thick 4-finger head . lacing hold up and sticks to the glass as if it was glued there . smell- rich aroma of american hops , fruitiness , cloves , a bit of brettanomyces , banana , boiled shoe leather , and grapefruit . nice smells . taste- grassy , clovey , bitter , medicinal , a hint of battery acid and paint thinner . fruitiness still comes thru all those flavors , peaches and wheat also linger on the tongue . mouthfeel- smooth , soft water , well-carbonated , hops linger on the tongue but this is not cloying or overly sticky . overall- nice to try , not something i would seek out for the rest of my life .'

S"this review is for the 2010 version , so that i have a baseline for subsequent reviews of earlier `` vintages '' ( brewtages ? ) . pours deep copper with a ruby tinge and only a slight veil . a generous light tan head makes it seem as if you could use bigfoot as a pillow . the head dissipates slowly , leaving impressive latice work on the side of the glass . the smell is surprisingly restrained given the flavor profile . the hop smells are all at the front ( mango/pine etc . ) but some of the toffee and burnt cream notes are allowed to make an appearance as well . mouthfeel is also appropriate for the style . it 's moderately thick , with just enough light carbonation to emphasize some of the hop notes to come . when consumed fresh , this beer is a full-fledged fundamentalist hop assault . if your world view is `` hops uber alles , '' then this is your barleywine . what i 'm missing here is complexity . the hop flavors are perfectly fine : we 've got the big three properly represented ( pine , citrus rind and spice/pepper ) . the problem here is that there is little balance : the brief carmel sweet note is restrained and dominated by the prolonged , one-note bitter finish . now , it 's essential to keep in mind that bigfoot is two beers in one . when aged , the hops moderate , revealing the immense malt complexity that is held backstage when fresh . if reviewed after 3 years , i would give this beer a much higher grade ."

S"i sampled a 12 ounce capped bottle in a frosted pint glass . a : it poured a bleached straw yellow that was nearly clear and capped with bone white bubbles that vanished so quickly that i hardly got a chance to know them . there was lacing . it 's a typical macro lager , as it should be given that it defines the style . s : i had a hard time getting an aroma to rise behond the lip of the glass . i may be dreaming but i believe i picked up a tad of malt but its possible i was smelling my buddies beer . t : for a beer that proudly advertises a `` born on date '' that was less than six weeks prior to touch my lips it did produce a refreshing cool liquid that goes well with spicy and thick foods . m : thin and light body with little front and a very clean finish . d : i could drink in a session about as much of this brew as i could during a similar session of drinking water . best on a hot sweaty day and served ice cold ."

S"thanks a ton to njpadrefan for this bottle . been looking forward to this . 12oz . brown bottle poured into a pint . no dating but it was released within a week . a : pours a very , very pale orange . completely transparent . 1 finger pearl white rocky head that remains a thick skim on the brew . 1 ring of fluffy lacing at the top and a pebble here and there on the way down . s : pretty straight forward . pine-y and citrus hops . a mixture of grapefruit with a tiny zap of lemon . just a hint of some phenols as it warms a tad . t/m : ah , very nice . not overly bitter but a nice strong wallop , har har . very citrus-y and tangy . the hops hold strong all the way through to the dry finish and then last and last . malts show up a little more as the brew warms but hops are definitely the highlight . the body is pretty thin , inviting me back before i know it . d : this went down so easy i did n't realize i was just about done . a local store has a handful of victory products ... lets hope they can get this in ."

S"now listening to : jigsaw - skyhigh thanks to beechwood for providing this stellar beer ! a- black as night with a two finger tan head . i do n't normally comment on lacing , but this was unusually relevant to this beer . in fact , the beer itself clung to the glass like a swirlled cognac . s- bourbon , some licorice and dark carmel . t- same as smell , only much sweeter . had with a bread pudding with cherry 's and chocolate and was almost overwhelmed by it all in my mouth at one time . m- unbelievable . if every beer had a mouth feel like this , i would not need solid foods ! d- as odd as this may sound after my mouthfeel notes , this took a while just to drink through my 8 oz glass . maybe it was the level of alchohol or maybe the overall richness , but there is no way that i could have had a second one of these on the same night ."

S"pint at the rogue pub in newport dock . in appearance it looks like typical lager , a good one , but at closer inspection the gold colour is more deep and solid than any i have seen . first thing i noticed is that the `` nose '' of this lager is slightly stronger in the maltiness than i expected..but of course thgere is plenty evidence of the hops . great tasting lager , not too thin like many if its ilk..very malty to start..sweet and rather thick , then a great floral hoppiness takes over as the beer leaves the mouth on its journey down the throat . very acceptable on the palate..very smooth . a very drinkable beer..i had three last night at the pub..that was after i had finished off a pint of the doppelbock and the chocolate stout ."

S"some american breweries seem to do this style pretty well , some not quite so well . flying fish is definitely in the latter group . i give flying fish some credit for trying to make a drinkable summer ale with low abv. , but i 'm puzzled by the fact they call this a saison/farmhouse beer . the beer looks , smells and tastes like a rather insipid pilsner . had on tap the other day at mahaffey 's . the beer pours a yellowish gold color with pretty persistent head retention and modest lacing . the nose is pretty close to non-existent , with none of the spice and/or funk one would normally associate with a belgium saison . if anything i get a very light aroma of hoppy bitterness . on the palate this beer is very light and crisp . i guess one might call it refreshing , except that it 's so light , watery and insipid , i really had no interest in finishing off my 10 ounce glass of the stuff . while i give flying fish points for keeping the abv . down , in this case they clearly did so at the expense of having much flavor . at least imo , this is not a beer that would hold any interest for me in the future ."

S"this offering from bell 's is a superb combination of a distinct coffee note coupled with a rich dark stout . the initial pour was very smooth and did not churn or overhead in the glass . the head was chocolate brown and hung in there for the beer , though much thinner toward the end . the smell was a rich odor of dark coffee , roasted malts , and a slight alcohol nose . the taste was initially that of the roasted and dark malts but not overly sweet . the coffee flavor then came through and was very pleasant and not at all overpowering . the alcohol taste was noticeable on the back of the throat and a nice compliment to the deep , complex flavors of this brew . i really enjoyed this beer ; i thought it was complex but well planned . very enjoyable , not a session beer , but well worth enjoying any time !"

S"a beer i frequently come back to , and here is why : a : a pretty , copper , and slightly clouded pour with a very nice head . this really does look pretty tasty in the glass . i would generally expect paler from a maibock , but for this review i 'm not judging quite as much by style . explanation for that below . s : yep , those are noble hops , done right . the hoppy aroma is not the pine or citrus you generally get with american craft beer from the region . this has some spice on the nose . some grass and a little clove also . t : ok , so we have a pretty clean taste here . the grain bill is probably a little off for maibock , but good . and once again , i 'm not marking it down for that . very noticeable hop character . especially hoppy lager that lends its bitterness well . oh , and there are some toasty notes that bring it together . m : clean , and though it 's a little heavy for this sort of lager , it 's still light enough to be well within range . well done , definitely . d : drinkable , but not hugely so . it 's not so refreshing you want to sit all may outside with a sandwich and a dead guy ( beer ) . but it 's often my first order at the local bar after a bike ride . this has some peculiarities for the style , as far as i can tell , but i generally dismiss them . i ca n't get a straight answer from anybody if this is lagered like a traditional helles bock , or just an ale approximation . the taste is ambiguous there too , but i 've tried to see if my palate would guide me . i 'll leave it at they should keep doing what they 're doing . if it 's not a german maibock , lets say it 's an american maibock . i 'd like to see some brewers do as well in an approximation of styles like this . bring on the american maibocks ."

S"a- deep dark chocolate color with a thick tan head . head fades slowly to a cap but leaves nice lacing on the glass . s- roasted malt , chocolate , coffee , and alcohol are the big notes . there are some subtle notes of fruit and vanilla in there as well . nice complex and inviting smell . t- big bold hit of the chocolate and the coffee right off the bat . fades quickly to roasted malts and then to a hop bitterness with a rush of warmth from the alcohol . complex and well balanced , but the alcohol overpowers a bit at the end . m- full bodied , and viscous , but with a little bit too much carbonation . would have hoped for a little more creaminess and a little less carbonation . d- the 9.2 % abv shows through and cuts down the drinkability a little . some time in the cellar would help this out , it should age quite well . it 's a big bold beer and it would be hard to have more than a couple of these . nice beer , not a stellar stout , but well done . age this some and it might be amazing . glad to see a successful brewer continue to experiment and push the envelope of their line ."

S"poured from a large corked bottle into a nonic glass . a : pours dark brown , likes almost like diluted molasses in terms of color . faint ruby hues . one finger of rapidly vanishing , fizzy tan foam , reminiscent of coca cola . s : sweet malts , earthy hops . it smells sort of like moss , which of kind of neat . not much else going on . t : woah nelly ! not feeling the love here . faint malt sweetness on the nose , with a feeble bittering hops finish , and very little going on in between . this beer has very little flavor , and tastes watered down . actually , if anyone out there on ba has ever made the continental dark ale kit you can buy in most homebrew stores ( the one in the blue and yellow box ) , it tastes an awful lot like that , except with less flavor . m : overly thin and briskly carbonated . d : i hate to say it , but i poured this one down the drain . edit : apparently the name was changed to noire de chambly in august of 2009 . since my bottle reads `` chambly noire , '' and i had it in july of 2010 , this bottle is at least 11 months old , and possibly more . everyone else on this site seems to like it , so perhaps we can conclude that it does not age well ."

S"poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a beer mug . appearance : rich amber color , with about one finger 's worth of head . light to moderate lacing on the glass with visible carbonation . does n't look too bad at all , i 'm anxious to give it a smell . smell : pungent , hoppy scent . definitely not the best beer i have ever smelled , but at least it has an aroma . sadly , the aroma lingers in the back of my throat quite bitterly . not impressed . i 'm a bit nervous about tasting it . taste : it 's not horrible ; that 's the best i can say . there 's a gentle sweetness which is undeniably overwhelmed by the bitter , disgusting taste of poorly selected hops . the only place on my tongue which really responds is the `` bitter '' section , and that 's never a good sign . ugh . mouthfeel : well , it 's not good , and it 's not bad . mild , slightly crisp . not watery , but definitely lighter than i would have expected . drinkability : no . do n't do it . would not recommend this beer to anybody . except for a fifty-year smoker , perhaps ; one whose taste buds have long since burned away ."

S"poured into sturdy chalice . poured with minimal , quickly dissipating head that leaves very light lacing . very low carbonation . a medium reddish-brown color . not much aroma , i did n't even get that spicy yeast smell that is typical for belgian-style brews . as the beer warmed the aroma became slightly more noticeable . there was more of the anticipated flavors in the taste than the aroma had led me to expect . very smooth , full body . very drinkable , i could see myself drinking several of these during those first warm spring days , when you start looking for a little more refreshment in a beer . overall a very nice brew , i will have this again ."

S'my impression of this beer may have a lot to do with the environment i tasted it in and the fact i only had one . i had one last weekend at the foot of the glacier in cameron lake in waterton park ( a beautiful postcard of a place ) after a 5 klick hike to the us side of the lake . sorry but i had a can and the true color may differ from my impression of it being way too pale for a draft type beer ( smoothed in cold aging process ) . the aroma was nearly undetectable but the taste was nice and smooth with a nice bready malt after taste . if they use some adjuncts to cheapen the process and make this a pogue-boy beer , it was not detectable and well buried in this thin-bodied beer . one of the better draft-style standard mega beers out there . to me , it came off well for what br had intended this brew to be ... .a smooth , mild-tasting draft style affordable beer for chugging on a hot day or after a work out . workin mans draft ... does johnny paycheck know about this canuck beer ? ... he may switch from his draft colorado cool-ade ; - )'

S"this english bitter pours a golden-tinted orange color with a smaller , one-finger white head that quickly dissipates leaving very littel lacing . as for aroma , i do n't pick up much of anything - what little i smell is primarily a malty , bread-like yeast nose mixed in with faint citrus notes but overall the aroma of this beer is a bit of a disappointment . the taste of this beer is definitely balanced yet i am again a bit disappointed that nothing of note stands out . the hoppiness of this beer can be described as mild ( at best ) . mainly , much like the aroma , the taste is predominantly biscuit-like malt and bready yeast but even those are not overly memorable . any note of citrus is limited to the front end and does not linger at all . this is a relativley light-to-medium bodied beer wth a modest about of carbonation . overall , the beer is somewhat dry on the tongue and has a nice , clean finish . definitely a session beer that has a low abv and may be better on a hot summer day . overall , i prefer beers with at least one quality that is memorable . this beer does n't do it for me . i look forward to suryly 's cynic ale which i think is one of their better ( if under appreciated ) beers . while this is n't a beer i plan on drinking much of , i do think it is a nice , easy drinking local brew that will appeal to some beer drinkers who are turned off by some of the bolder brews from surly ."

S"12 oz bottle poured into an over sized mug . tall fizzy purple/blue head . color is a dark grape soda purple . even though i know it 's a blueberry beer , that color is really off-setting . smell some grainy malt characteristics , but the syrupy sweet blueberries is overwhelming . tastes like carbonated ihop blueberry syrup . i think the higher abv is to get you jacked up so you do realize what it is you are drinking . i think high school cheerleaders will love this . sometimes you have to experience the really bad in order to appreciate the really good ."

S"first , this is a very well balanced beer , in my opinion . the sweetness of the malt blends very well with the rye spice and hops . there is moderate head with little retention . entry has a nice molasses bomb , followed by an equally sweet midpalate . finish is dry with the spicyness of the rye and well-balanced hop flavors taking over . while this is not what i would call a `` session beer , '' there is room for a few . at 4.49 for a bomber , would definately drink again ."

S"i really enjoyed the dfh version of this brew so when i saw this offering during a recent trip to new jersey , i had to buy this italian version . poured into a standard pint glass from a 12.7 oz stubby green bottle . the oversized cap opens with an audible pop somewhat similar to champagne . goodness , what is this stuff ? the bottle cap is quite unique , unlike anything i have seen to date . it features a `` steril top '' plastic coating underneath somewhat similar to the style of some screwtop growler lids . the pour yields a light golden colored brew that is lightly hazy . 3 fingers worth of frothy white foam swells across the top and as it slowly recedes leaves a thick froth of lacework all over the glass . it rests atop the brew a finger strong in a thick uneven cratered surface composed of rather large bubbles that are constantly , slowly streaming to the surface . first whiff of this brew produces nearly a white wine scent , grape-like initially mixed with sulfur that fades and develops into a new beast . hops emerge smelling grassy and a bit herbal in nature . lightly mineral filled with a straw-like to biscuit or cereal grain inclusion . as the brew warms up , i lose focus on the sulfur notes and really start to hone in on the herbal hop characteristics . there is a light almost mint and pine aspect to the backend of this brew and a light inclusion of alcohol which makes the aroma stand out . this is not a bold smelling brew by any regards but as it comes up to temperature it certainly goes through a transformation , this is an interesting experience . taste follows suit with an herbal bitterness that tastes more grassy than any other brew i have had . it leads into a malt flavor very reminiscent of straw characteristics instead of grain . there is an ever-present light green yeast flavor which really accents an unfavorable sulfur taste . there is a very mild grape skin character to this brew and an almost minty hop inclusion that evolves as the brew warms up . there is a modest amount of mineral character that almost nears metallic character which was easily ignored initially but as the brew warmed up it got increasingly more evident . by the time i get to the end of my glass , i fear a second pour to finish off the bottle . i bust out some sharp cheese and yes , this brew becomes tolerable . i have never had a beer before that i disliked by itself but only enjoyed after pairing it with some cheese . oh well , there is a first time for everything . this is a medium to light bodied brew favoring medium more so than the lighter side . it is modestly carbonated to"

S"this beer was given to me in a trade with the generous mhewes . this is my third beer from founders and i 'm pretty excited . i poured the bottle as hard as i could into my big brandy snifter . the body is murky brownish orange . it yields a very thin cap of foam despite the hard pour . the smell is ridiculous ! rich caramel , with big pine , citrus , floral , peppery cinnamon and also a bit bready . it 's so strong it makes my nostrils flare . the smell is n't deceiving either . the taste is just as delicious as the smell leads you to believe . a fair amount of sweetness to balance out the extreme hoppage . it 's slightly toasty rye with honey , clove and peppermint on top of the caramel , pine and citrus mentioned before . nice warming boozey finish . mouthfeel is like hot , bubbly syrup . not the smoothest , but lively for sure . this a damn good beer . it 's a lot rougher than say hopslam though . i 'll probably call it quits after this one 12 oz bottle ."

S"a - dark mahoganey wood brown with a dirty tan head , medium in size . good lacing . this beer lost a whole point from me in this category because of labels on the bottle , which basically insult you and say that if you do n't like this beer it 's because you are n't sophisticated enough . for questions and comments , it basically suggests you go **** yourself . i am not overlooking the whole `` arrogant bastard '' theme here , but i just spent over five bucks on this one tall bottle , so this type of self-important crap is pretty annoying . s - pure hop oil . tart , piney grapefruit smell and something like celery ( ? ? ? ) . t - holy bitterness . tons of hops , little else . not that i know , but this is what i imagine pine tree sap would taste like . aftertaste = grapefruit . a hint of malt sweetness is almost detectable for just a second , then it 's gone . almost zero balance ; just tons of hops . m - thick and warm , due to the high abv . d - between the extreme dose of hops , and the sharp bite of the relatively poorly-hidden alcohol , i 'm ready to switch to something else after about 8 oz . not my style whatsoever . this ale was way , way , way too hoppy for my tastes . evidently - or according to the packaging - this is because i am a giant moron and a sissy when it comes to beer . i know i 'm probably taking the damn label waaaay too seriously , but in my eyes if you put statements like that on your bottle , your beer sure as hell better deliver . and arrogant bastard simply did not deliver . it reminded me of the compressed pellet of hops i tasted when i toured the anheiser-busch brewery in st. louis . i had some other arrogant bastard beers on my to-try list , but i will cross them off unless someone wants to throw a bottle my way for free ."

S"appearence : pours a hazy brown with a foamy tan head . head lingers for a while . as with a decent amount of bell 's brews i 've had , there are massive chunks of yeast floating . i know it 's a result of the bottle conditioning but i think it 's a bit overboard . smell : smells malty and creamy , with milk and coffee notes . the hops make a decent presence , and create nice balance . taste and mouthfeel : tastes very much like toffee . the roasted caramel notes shine through , and the hops are floral and provide a long lingering finish . the mouthfeel is the normal velvety feel most bell beers have , but i can actually feel the yeast in my mouth . maybe just a bad bottle . drinkability and overall : this is very nice tasting beer , but the yeast is overboard . too much . this is a problem that needs fixed . other than that i loved the flavor of the beer , and it smelled among the best . hopefully this is just a bad bottle ."

S"got this for $ 2.99 for a 6-pack at trader joe 's . low expectations . a : pours a golden yellow color with a thick layer of foam . not much lacing , head retention is decent but very thin and aerated , not at all creamy . s : smells predominantly of corn , grains , alcohol and aluminum . faint honey aroma as well . not very appealing . t : tastes like a watered down version of what a pilsner should be ; definitely no pilsner urquel . the flavor up front is pretty bland and dominated by a sweet corn , grain and metal flavor . the backend of the swig slightly redeems itself with some buttery flavors , but overall rather on the dull side . m : way too carbonated , like many other cheap beers . as others have said , kind of malt-liquor-ish . not outright watery , but not much body to speak of . d : probably the best thing about this beer is how sessionable it is , though i would definitely grab something else if given the choice . but hey , at around .50c per can i ca n't really complain ."

S'brewed by northern lights but only available at eagles pub in cheney , wa . eagles pub is a college oriented bar near the eastern washington university ( eagles ) campus . hence the name . served in a pint glass . $ 2 regular price . pours a copper/brown color and is hazy . an egg shell white head tops the glass , and is moderately resilient . ok lacing . smell is faint and grainy . oats , barley . the taste is a bitter cereal flavor . with a sort of stale hop finish . mouth feel is ok. clean and well carbonated.. a drinkable but average at best for a craft brew . still better than most offerings in a college bar , and a good value at $ 2 per pint .'

S"bottle shared generously by richard last night . a : the pour is a dark brown , nearly black color with a big tan head on it . s : smoke , salt , and more smoke . the bacon moniker is accurate , and that 's not really a good thing . t : i thought the nose was bacon like , but the flavor has a very salty and smokey flavor and there 's a distinct meaty flavor . it 's almost reminiscent of smoked almonds . m : the body is medium and the carbonation on this beer is really weird . almost grainy , but maybe that 's just the salty flavor . d : it seems some brewers just way overdo the smoke in these kinds of beers . while i enjoy some smoke flavor in certain beers ( like a porter or stout ) , this was like sucking down the smoke of a campfire ."

S"thanks to the very generous onecrazymofo for this one ... one of many . pours a fantastic orange ... real cloudy , the way i expect my iipa 's to look . two full fingers of creamy tan head ... lacing is perfect ... tons of clingy webs ... head is going nowhere . aroma is beautiful ... piney citrus eminating from the glass . a touch of cotton candy and tropical fruit as well . the taste is a semi-sweet explosion of hops and malt..ca n't say it is one-sided at all , although the bitterness that sucks away any moisture in my mouth makes me think the hops will win the battle . it is as if they squeezed in a florida orange in each bottle . the carbonation is perfect for its style and it is quite refreshing . thick , syrupy mouthfeel ... bittersweet aftertaste that makes you crave for more . one of the most highly drinkable 9+ % abv brews i have ever had ... up there w/ victory 's storm king . all the hype this brew receives and i must agree w/ the masses ... the best iipa out there ."

S"budweiser=terrible clam juice= terrible tomato juice= terrible this ca n't end good . so what i gather from talking to a few people , this is similar to the bloody mary to cure a hangover thing . unfortunately , i 'll be drinking this as my first beer of the day in the early afternoon . i refuse to taint my glasses with this mess , so i will be drinking this directly from the 24 oz can it comes in . thus , the appearance will receive a 3 to be fair . i would do the same for the aroma , but as soon as i crack the can , the stench emitting from it is overpowering . i 'll put it like this , after taking a sip , my wife refused to kiss me and told me to go brush my teeth first . as i take my first sip , i remind myself to remain objective despite my prior assumptions of the beer . did n't take long for the preconceived notion to come to fruition though . this is going to take awhile to get down . all i 'm getting is clamato . i ask myself maybe i was supposed to shake it . i examine the can and see `` ino agite ! do not shake . rotate gently to mix '' doh ! ! ca n't rotate it gently now so i pour it into one of those cheap plastic cup you get as souvenirs from places . there is all kinds of shit floating in this . bits of tomato and clam ? i just threw up in my mouth a little . it also smells worse now . the can actually did it justice . kept the aroma back and hid all the shit suspended in it . pouring it into the cup did let some of the budweiser come through , but clamato still dominates . this shit sucks . i told myself i would finish it no matter what , but this is gon na be tough . this beer is terrible . ticker or not , i 'd try to avoid this one if i were you ."

S'poured from a 12 oz . brown bottle . slightly hazy golden hue . a previous pour showed off virtually no head and zero sustainability ; this time , a more vigorous pour delivers a tall , faintly off-white mousse-like head that falls away with a little restraint , eventually settling to a small topper that leaves behind only slight rings of disappearing lace on the glass . aroma is mild and wheaty , with a bit of light lemony citrus and just the faintest , nearly indiscernible note of clove . smooth and light in body with a bit less carbonation than expected for a hefeweizen . slightly sweet barley malt mixes with wheat on the palate , sliding into a bit of lemon zest , orange and just a touch of unknown spice , finishing light and with a lingering sweet citrus fade . inoffensive and very easy-drinking , but completely mislabeled . american pale wheat ale is much more appropriate , as hefeweizen this is not . no clove , bubblegum , banana -- nothing that would suggest a bavarian yeast strain ; rather poor head retention and only a faint haze certainly suggest either a low level of wheat causing a lack of protein or a bit too much filtering , and no roiling of the yeast is necessary in this non-bottle-conditioned brew , as is common in true hefeweizens . a decent session beer , perhaps , but a bastardization of a name .'

S"a - i do n't care for the bottle so much , reminds me of one of those football stadium plastic things ... but the beer itself is pretty . very very dark red to brown that lets very little light through . has the classic tan thick creamy foamy head . lacing continues down the glass . s - smells like one of those irish cream flavored creamers you put in your coffee . slight maltiness as well , but very subdued . t/m - about all there is to say is that its creamy creamy and more creamy . you 'd expect there to be other flavors there , but there is n't really . there 's a malt flavor that sticks in your mouth as you finish . it 's rather unique in it 's lack of complexity . that is n't to say it tastes bad , it just does n't taste like much . feels rather thick in your mouth though , like ... well ... heavy cream or half and half . d - low alcohol and a pleasant ( if mundane ) flavor make this a beer you can drink forever ."

S"pours with viscosity ... thick and oily . leaves a small light-brown head . very light but sweet aroma ... no hint of the 10+ abv . wonderful taste . compared to some of the highly complex beers i 've tried from founders , the imperial stout is fairly subdued . the start and finish is quite smooth , with a more intense and sweet middle . i keep thinking of really nice european dark chocolate when i sip . the thick and slightly granular feel is tremendous . overall , this is a really , really nice imperial stout . what it lacks in complexity it makes up for with wonderful smoothness and flavor . another great creation from founders ."

S"picked this up at royal liquor in kansas city . not available here in wichita . appearance : not nearly as dark as the other stouts that i have been drinking lately . ( i 'm on a bit of a stout kick right now . ) it poured a good old fashioned brown color . collected in the glass , it darkened up a little and gained some hints of red . light penetrated it easily . the tan head rose up to three fingers quickly and with little coaxing . it settled down quickly , though , and was soon just a cap of bubbles on top of the brew . this lingered until the beer was gone . there was some light lacing left behind on the side of the glass . smell : the aromas that were there were nice , just too thin . dark roasted malts , cream , and light hints of chocolate were present . the coffee was definitely apparent , but not too overpowering . it came across like old coffee that has been sitting in the pot for hours after the maker was shutoff . not much else going on except the occasional whiff of smoke . mouthfeel : light-bodied and very thin for a stout . it did have a certain `` presence '' that kept it from being a complete bomb in this catagory , but i could n't quite put my finger on it . taste : from the start , the coffee flavor , while not too strong , dominated the taste . it did n't have that deep , rich character that other coffee laced stouts that i have sampled had . it seemed sharp , thin , acidic , and had a very low bitterness . now , i like my coffee acidic as hell , but this beer lacked the depth to back it up . there was some sweet malt thrown in to help balance things out . milk chocolate and cocoa arose well into the aftertaste . i know i seemed a little rough on this beer , but it was n't bad . it was actually very quaffable , as evidenced by the fact that the drinkability score is the highest one . i just expect more from a coffee stout than this provided . i think the problem might be that the base stout just does n't have the balls to handle this assignment . i would like to see them try this again with a beefier brew ."

S'interesting offering from rogue . when rogue claims something is bitter , that gets my attention . however , this turned out to be a very well balanced imperial style ale . the aroma is strong of hop oil with some buttery and caramel smells coming through as well . substantial in the mouth , a bit dry after the swallow . taste is very smooth , striking a nice balance between the hops and malts . it tastes very fresh , almost as if the hop oil essence was squeezed right into the beer . that makes this one quite a change from the usual scene , but it also would keep me from guzzling it all night . the acidity is nice as well , with the grapefruit flavor providing a bit of sweetness . as shocked as i am to say it , this could be a nice beer to introduce someone to the style . i never expected to say that of a rogue beer . thumbs up , solid effort .'

S"chateau jiahu poured a light , cloudy amber with good head development despite what appeared to be lazy carbonation in the glass . aroma was fruity and alcoholic with both sour and sweet notes , neither of which were overpowering . pleasant smell overall , very similar to dogfish head 's midas touch . taste was sweet and somewhat wine-like . this beer has a very mellow fruitiness to it . not what i would typically drink , but good . mouthfeel is dry and smooth with well developed carbonation , despite my earlier visual observations . moderate to high alcohol content lends to a warming sensation . not bad for an herbed/spiced beer , although i prefer midas touch over this recipe ."

S'on tap at mcgraths in harrisburg presented a muddy brown with red hints . moderate tan head . smell is orange peal and grapefruit . spectacular aroma . first sip is a powerful blend of orange and pine . nice balance of bitter and sweet in the orange . medium to heavy body . however , a harsh cheep vodka presence overcomes me in the finish . dreadful . this was so promising but i hesitated on each sip thinking about how bad the finish was . i ended up giving the rest to my friend who said he barely noticed it ( the harsh vodka flavor ) and thought it was good . my wife also thought it was ok , so im thinking it was a good sample , just not something i enjoy in a iipa . would like to taste some bottled so i can age it slightly . maybe the vodka would die down with age ?'

S"i had this at a college bar in toronto , hoping it would be a bit better than the labatt 's and moosehead also available . i figure , if you 're going to make an ipa , then it 's probably not fizzy yellow stuff , right ? wrong . it 's fizzy yellow stuff - by appearance this is dark straw with minimal head and a coarse carbonation . no perceptible hop aroma . no perceptible bitterness or flavor , and even the malt falls painfully flat . it 's hard to imagine a mouthfeel below `` not impressed '' , so it gets 2 points there . all in all , i suppose this is drinkable if you 're out of bud light , but i ca n't give it much more than that ."

S'drank on-tap at the publick house , brookline , ma poured a slightly hazed , golden amber with a tight , bright white , three-finger head that slowly faded to a thin film . huge chunks of lacing stuck all down the glass . the aroma was distinctly belgian . a powdery yeastiness was immediately detectable along with orange peel , coriander , spices and candi sugar . as the beer warmed , the sweetness really came out . the taste was similar to the nose . fruity overtones came through strong up front , along with some candi sugar and flowery notes . orange peel and spices were noticeable mid-palate . strong alcohol appeared out of nowhere and really crescendoed into the finish . some mild hops came through as well . mouthfeel was lighter bodied and fluffy with a fine , almost tingly carbonation . drinkability on this beer was a mixed bag . i really enjoyed the flavors and aromas but i found the alcohol to be a bit overwhelming .'

S"pbr me asap ! this is my `` go to '' beer when i am in wisconsin . i make frequent family visits and often find myself sitting at the bar with my father and many uncles ( all retired ) who like to `` slam '' their miller lites . it is a `` pace '' game to keep up with the group since it is expected that everyone takes a turn at buying a round . there is no time to sit and reflect on the nuances of the beverage . i would never attempt to go beer-for-beer with them while consuming a proper craft beer that is north of 6 % abv . so why do i like pabst ? it is the driest of the macros and as such is the easiest beer to drink that does n't taste like water . especially out of a bottle , it is quite a pleasing beverage . goes great with a burrito . if you have ever tried a can of pabst and nearly choked , please do yourself a favor and try a bottle of pbr . you might be surprised . remember , it is the only beer to have won the blue ribbon at the 1893 world 's fair . it deserves respect . if you ever find yourself near afton , wisconsin . make sure to stop into `` skip 's friendly village '' . my uncle skip used to distribute pbr before buying this bar . as such , he gives the beer proper recognition in his establishment where the cans are consumed in high volumes . if you ask , he might even set you up with a bottle of pbr from his personal stash . cheers to pbr ! the best of the worst ."

S"a stunning beer to look at and positively humbling to smell . brown/black and surging with slow , lazy fizz - though there is no possibility of any doughiness to the head . it falls to an oily slick of gray . the aromas are , in fact , of `` sludge . '' there is a murky , seaweed and rotting grass core to the bouquet that suggests coffee-fed cattle and hogs . it is a touch nauseating , but only a touch . compelling to the beholder ( especially one raised on western island scotch ) is the peaty , iodine-rich , smoked molasses sweetness available to the nose . i taste it . sweet , and suggestive of solera-treated sugars from the spanish empire : brandy , pedro ximenez , rum , malaga . the flavors move upon the palate with unrelenting seriousness . bubbling , rotting tanks of molasses , cured spinach , shoe polish decorate the rancio nuttiness and toffee of the former . i am a disciple of the kuhnhenn way . this is a brewery that takes risks and always issues forth a fascinating drink independent of how challenging or even awkward it may initially seem . my advice is to study these repeatedly ."

S'12 oz . bottle , a : pours a clear light amber/orange with a small white head , no lace , solid retention . s : nice fresh smell of ginger , pleasing . t : light malt , some ginger , the overall flavour is really mild , not too exciting . m : watery , feels like a light lager . thin character . fizzy . clean and crisp at least . d : better than a macro lager , but not by much especially with the mouthfeel . the ginger keeps it a little interesting , but left hand should have done more with this , would make a good starter craft at least .'

S'pours dark brown/back , not too viscous . modest head , yet nice collar and some lacing . has a slight sour smell on the nose , but with obvious chocolate and roast . given their other beers , i was expecting a little more from this one . starts out soft with some chocolate roast , and a little tartness ( elderberries ? ) , tartness is coupled with the bitterness from the dark roast and melds well , drying off into the finish . nice flavor , but relatively simple . this has a certain similarity with their other beers , common yeast maybe ? medium , medium light mouthfeel with soft carbonation . it is fairly drinkable .'

S'330ml bottle into chimay chalice , both from the gift pack , woohoo ! 1cm off-white to pale straw head with reduces down to nothing . hazy brown red color , i think i got a little of the sediment in the chalice . also , maybe hazier than expected due to the width of the chalice which darkens the color since light has to pass through more beer ... raisin citrus aroma with the lightest hint of malt . tastes a huge yeasty malt pretzel , then a fruity hop bitterness and slight black peppery spice . sparkly carbonation makes for a very crisp start and just the slightest astringency . it lightens up the medium body and is a bit drying on the finish . finish is a great balance between malt and hoppy bitterness with slight warming feel from the alcohol , though the alcohol is not otherwise tasted/smelled . fairly drinkable though the snappyness of the carbonation starts to wear on me after a bit .'

S"batch 12 , bottled may 2010 a - typical unfiltered , deep orange/light brown in the middle fading out to a light orange . little head but excellent lacing . average amount of carb . s - lots of pungent hops up front but not the freshest smelling i 've ever experienced , but by no means the weakest . hops are slightly citric ( grapefruit and lemon ) with a hint of floral . malt backbone not too present but residual sugars from the high abv can be detected . t - much different than the aroma imo . the hops are definitely there but they take on a much more sap , sticky alpha acid resin , and floral flavor . again , the maltiness is completely overpowered by the hops but can be picked up at the end with some starchy sugar . hops finish a little on the citrus side as well . m/d - typical thick dipa body , beautifully carbonated to break up the intense flavors , and the palate is left completely dry . not the most complex flavor but very well done as this beer is a complete hop bomb . pretty much your typical dipa with a kick in the mouth hop flavor . this one leaves the mouth dry as the sahara but is a wonderful example of its style"

S'im not much of a brown ale fan , but this was a pretty good beer . although it literally exoploded out of the bottle , when it finally settled down , it had a nice dark brown color with a thick brown head that lingered thru most of the glass and left good lacing . aroma was a pleasant malty roasted nuts and other earthy notes . body was a litle on the thin side , but the flavor was a full continuation of the malty roasted nuts , with only a hint of chocolate . a nice , long , almost warming finsih made this a perfect drink for a cool fall night .'

S"sierra nevada southern hemisphere harvest fresh hop ale ( or as us in the know call it `` snshhfha , '' pronounced , obviously `` sin-shif-haa '' ) is a blast of hopped goodness from one of the originators of the craft beer movement , chico , ca 's sierra nevada . it 's no secret that these guys make great beer , and besides having perhaps the greatest , most consistent and sessionable beers you 'll find in most decent bars , they often bring the ruckus with shit like this . snshhfha comes as a blessing to north americans from the `` down under '' new zealanders who are slowly claiming a larger and larger percentage of the world 's market for hops , providing loads of organic hops at reasonable prices ( and delicious varietals at that ) . this beer , available for the first time in bombers , is pretty much all over the place by this point . i picked up a bottle of this before a radio show i do sometimes and it treated me quite nicely . pours a beautiful dark gold color with a huge head and a very refreshing amount of carbonation . this is a balanced beer , not an over the top hop monster , and with a relatively low & lt ; 7 % abv , a very drinkable beer indeed . there 's a lot of good malt , a lot of good hop spice , flavor , and aroma , and sierra nevada succeeds again in the realm of highly quaffable session beers which are n't boring , bland , or shallow . this is a truly great beer for summertime when you want something a little on the darker side of a pale ale or lager . enjoy it while it 's around ."

S"17 ounce bottle . this beer pours out a very pale yellow color with a large , white head . lots of rising carbonation is visible well after the pour . the aroma is lemony with some faint grassy hops . sugary lemon flavor . some grainy maltiness is noticable too , as well as some hops . the beeriness is kept to a minimum . the lemon flavor is much more noticable . there is also a pronounced ginger flavor . this beer is just like i expected . it probably wo n't appeal to most beer lovers , but i thought it was pretty good ."

S"i love houblon chouffe , so i had to try this domestic version of the infamous 'belgian ipa , '' my .02 a : pale orange/amber color , fine meade and heavily carbonated , fluffy tan head . s : big and strong citrus , pine notes . very wet , dank , almost moldy ( not in a bad way ) odor , ( reminds me of pacific northwest grown hop characteristics ) . mild grapefruit notes . t : it tastes just like it smells . strong , clean , bitter finish . mf : light . bitter aftertaste disaptes quickly . d : highly sessionable for 8.0 % + abv , but this is where i marked this interpretation of the style down . the immense hoppy character is much like that of a traditonal west coast ipa ( big nose , big taste ) , and i know the brewery is from the west coast , but to call it a `` belgian ipa '' where it barely has any sweet character , generally seen with belgian yeast strands , is a error . its not even tame like a east coast ipa . i had to mark it down for , imo , being mislabeled . i think raging bitch is more in the west coast ipa category , than the belgian style . my .02"

S"growler filled at the brewery on christmas eve . i stopped in to get one of these and a growler of the wright pils only to find out they were out of the pils . so , i got 2 growlers of this and it became my session beer for a few long holiday days ! looks great . dark black with small head . looks nice in my pint glass ! smell is roasted malt and a touch of chocolate . taste follows the smell with a nice roasty taste that hints at coffee and chocolate . bitterness is mild and this has a crisp element to it . a bit lighter and no real perceptible effects from the oats . mouthfeel is average at best . now , i know this is brewed in a more traditional angle that the more extreme beers of today , and i know this is a sessionable low abv stout . but i wanted just a bit more silky and dense mouthfeel . i guess it 's a trade-off with the drinkability though , which scores super high due to the refreshing and satisfying taste . glad i got to enjoy this over the holidays . certainly one of the better low abv stouts i 've ever had ."

S"i went to a tasting , and had to buy a bottle based on the sampling i had . i would say that the bottle may be a little large..by the end i grow tired of the banana taste , but i 'd say 10-12oz is just right . some may love/hate a dessert beer or one that is flavored with something like banana , but i do enjoy this one in moderation . it is not overdone in the least . it accurately encompasses the banana bread vibe without sacrificing the beer itself ."

S"pours a very clear , pale golden color with a light fluffy white head that lasts for a little while before slowly subsiding and leaving moderate lacing . strawberry cleanly evident in the aroma . taste is more bready with a strawberry presence that is n't nearly as pronounced as the aroma may lead you to believe . tart but not too fruity . was concerned this may be too sweet but it is actually fairly well balanced . medium body with medium carbonation . pretty refreshing on a hot day so drinkability is definitely up there when the temperature outside is right . taste imparted by the strawberries is not overdone and it does seem quite fresh unlike some artificial tasting fruit beers . overall one of the few abita offerings that might be worth picking up ."

S"poured not very cold . attractive red amber , w/ an off-white head that dissipates quickly , leaving a frothy film . smell is mild . breakfast cereal , roasted nuts , green tea grassiness . nice . from a 12-pack , maybe it helped the beer avoid the subtle skunk mentioned by other reviewers . tastes of toasty grain , nuts , a bit of fruit like red apple and grape . fairly pronounced astringency , like black tea , that really makes the beer . some grain sweetness that is well balanced by this wonderful astringency . the finish is dry , in a good mildly astringent black tea way . they do n't come more drinkable ( including water ) . the mouthfeel has this great astringency in the right temperature range , but it 's unfortunately watery . this beer has a reputation for smoothness and drinkability , but it deserves a bit more than that . it blossoms at warmer temperatures , revealing some surprising and enjoyable complexity without becoming any less drinkable . ,"

S"2008 release ; sampled december 2008 you would be hard pressed to find a beer that made less sound when popping the cork / cap on it . thankfully the beer has a light carbonation to it that musters up some frothy , pale , off-white colored froth that almost covers the beer . the beer is a red / dark pink tinged , light amber color that shows a fairly clear , almost red-copper color when held up to the light . the aroma has quite a strong note of macerated , fermenting raspberries ( it does n't quite retain the piquancy of fresh raspberries but is close ) . it is hard to smell anything but the raspberries in the nose ; perhaps a hint of dusty malt , but i almost think i am imagining this . wow the nose is profoundly boring , though not bad if you like raspberries . fairly dry tasting up front and there is a nice , though slight , lactic bite to this beer that is noticeable throughout the flavor profile . the raspberry flavors are much reduced from what the aroma was ( thank god ) and there is actually a couple of other things noticeable besides raspberry notes . the raspberry flavors here seem more an infusion from the aroma than an actual raspberry flavor ; it lightly stains the flavor profile with a raspberry seed astringency , a light raspberry flesh fruitiness and a touch of tannic raspberry skin character . some oak barrel flavors lightly add to the character to , with notes of spicy , tannic oak and a soft boost to the body / texture of this beer . exceedingly quaffable , the light sourness , coupled with the fairly light body make this quite easy to drink ; i could imagine this being quite refreshing on a hot summer 's day . this could definitely use more carbonation though as it only has a light carbonation . well this being my last one of these from this years release that i will get to try ( send me a kiwi please ) , i have to say that i am really starting to miss the funkiness and biting acidity of a real lambic . these start to get a bit bland after a while , though they are certainly valiant attempts . in particular the super aromatic notes of the raspberry is just to powerful for this beer to remotely stand up to , so the nose is all raspberry . my particular , general apathy towards raspberry beers makes this one a bit less enjoyable than the other upland lambics , but it is certainly on the same level as the others ."

S"12oz bottle courtesy of soulforpeanuts ( thanks , rick ! ) into a perfect pint . a - far and away the darkest dipa i 've ever seen -- looks more like an imperial amber/red than anything else . big , fluffy two fingers of head with great retention . rings of lace on the glass . s - very sweet-smelling . lots of caramelly malt , some vanilla , brown sugar . not much in the way of a hoppy bite , but it 's there in the background . alcohol is evident in the nose , which is not a surprise considering the abv . t - looks like an amber , tastes like an american barleywine . toffee , burnt sugar , and caramel flavors , coupled with just a little bit of a hop bitterness . but the alcohol has more presence than i 'd like , and makes the finish long and dry . this one definitely needs a year or two , and that would take it out of dipa territory . m - thick and creamy , which is kind of strange for a dipa . but it 's not a bad thing . full bodied and pleasant . d - at 12.5 % , with the alcohol not very well hidden , it 's not really drinkable at all . you 'd never buy a 4 or 6-pack of this for the afternoon ( do n't know if it even comes like that ) . flavors are nice enough , but definitely one-and-done . o - strong , with a sweet malt background and hoppy overtones . sounds like an american barleywine , right ? i think the brewer has miscategorized this one . it 's not bad , but not something i 'd go out of my way to seek out ."

S"750ml bottle into chimay `` baby chalice '' holding 150 ml . a quarter of inch thin bubbly head that instantly dissipates . the beer 's appearance is of good whiskey with some yeasty floaties . the back labels claims this is a belgium 's strongest x-mas beer . indeed , the nose detects sherry with heavy loads of honey . the flavor is of strongly fortified wine with lots of fruity esters of figs and raisins with addition of honey . the sweetness is nicely balanced by sensation of potency derived from high alcohol content . despite that , alcohol is not noticeable in an unpleasant way - it 's alcoholness is well hidden and is only revealed by warming sensations in the gut and fortified wine alike sensory qualities . no burning , completely lacking any sensation of an absolute alcohol . the viscosity is on heavy side of medium bodied or light side of heavy bodied beers.yeast particles are increasing in number and the beer gets denser , almost syrupy , as we are approaching the bottom of the bottle . the beer is deficient of co2 and some additional carbonation would improve the mouthfeel . considering its abv is drinkable as water . a very good brew for sure . the only major flaw is nearly complete absence of head which significantly reduces its overall rating . however , this beer deserves to be rated above 4 and the importance of appearance ( contributing 20 % to the total score ) is highly exaggerated . this is not a miss world competition . i would have rated it around 4.3 but the calculating system attributed it 3,95 only which is injustice ."

S'hard-poured into a new belgium tulip . a : pale gold with excellent clarity and a little effervescence . head is noticeably lacking and lacing is negligible . s : pepper seems prominent , followed by lemon zest and a touch of fruity hops . some grain . t : leads with two-note punch of belgian yeast : spicy pepper and lemon fruitiness . a little more sweet and less tart than expected for style . big grains here , almost grassy . a little bitter and spicy for finish . m : possesses a relatively big body and lacks bright carbonation . soft on palate . d : cynicale feels a bit too symplistic for the style , but i think what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in drinkability .'

S'served in a warsteiner smooth sided mug . glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically . appearance : the beer is a clear brown with golden bronze tones and a `` light tan head that recedes fairly soon leaving a small ring around the liquid and some patches of foam on the surface . sipping leaves light patchy lacing for most of the beer smell : the aroma is faint bit soft and clean . there is a faint presence of light roasted caramel malts and chocolate and neither alcohol nor hops are detectable . taste : the flavor is pretty much what would be expected from the aroma . there is lightly roasted caramel malt with some very mild chocolate and no alcohol . however the flavor does contain some grassy hop bitterness that counter balances the sweetness of the malt . mouthfeel : the mouthfeel is light to medium in body with some softness from the light , persistent carbonation . the finish is medium length and begins in sweetness , then switches to some dry grassy hop bitterness and then fades quietly away . drinkability : while not a great beer this is a pleasant enough one and i could easily have another . while not challenging in any way this beer goes down easily . the last half of the beer also went quite well with the bratwurst sandwich and german potato salad that i had for lunch .'

S"2005 version appearance is perfect . nice clear mahogany with a perfect 1 finger creamy head of miniscule bubbles . leaves lacing all the way down the glass , which is very unexpected for the style . smell is almost all hops , and i 'm not talking the nice citrusy hops that i love . pure pine needles . there is actually some caramel malt smell underneath everything , just barely . unfortunately it does n't show up in the taste . at first the hops bite hard . like eating pine needles . then you wait for the initial hop bite to subside and for the malt to smooth things over ... and you can wait all day if you want , but it never happens . the finish is even worse - it 's pure bitterness . there is absolutely no flavor that lingers in the mouth , just bitterness , and linger it does ! mouthfeel is actually pretty good . nice and thick and creamy like i like my barleywines . right now i do n't care how good this will taste in 10 years , it 's nearly undrinkable at the moment ."

S"i got this beer at the olive garden . i was told that they had an imported lager from italy . i was not impressed . this beer did not taste bad , in fact it did n't taste much different than its american cousins , coors and miller light . this beer should be priced like an american lager , because it has been flattend in taste so much that it resembles one of the lesser american lagers . it is worse than sam adams and budweiser . taste - there is a dry aftertaste . other than that the malt is barely there and the hops are practically non-existant ."

S"remember the choklat by southern tier ? well , as mentioned before , that is one of five beers in southern tier 's blackwater series of imperial stouts . the first that i tried , and maybe most ridiculous of them all is the creme brulee milk stout . this is a beer that really redefines what flavors can exist in beer . yes , the choklat was brewed with swiss chocolate and does has immense bittersweet chocolate flavors and aromas pouring throughout it . but try the creme brulee stout and you will see what i mean . it has been brewed with vanilla beans to give it a desert like vanilla sweetness , lactose sugar for added smooth character and a sugary sweet body , and among other malts , dark caramel malt . i expect this was the largest portion of the malt used because this beer literally smells and tastes exactly like a creme brulee . i 've said ridiculous once already , but it 's just ridiculous . really , unless you 've had this beer before , you have never had anything like it . the guys at southern tier are some of my favorite brewers , and they describe the creme brulee stout it so well themselves that i have to reiterate it here : '' we are not the harbingers of truth as some may suggest but it may indeed be argued that our brewing philosophy is tantamount to a dessert with a bellicose past . how , you may ask , would a brewery determine a likeness to hard-coated custard ? our response is simple ; it 's all in the power of history , and of course , the extra finesse needed to top off a contentious treat with definition . by comprehending the labyrinthine movement of time , one would not think it strange to trace the errant path of an ordinary object such as a cream dessert only to discover that it has been the cause of cultural disputes since the middle ages . the british founders of burnt cream and from spain , crema catalana , both stand by their creative originality and we respect that , but it was the french crme brle , amid the strife of contention , that survived to represent our deliciously creamy brew . '' history and finesse may have come together to create this beer , but i have come to drink it ! while it may sound like desert , it does pack a punch at 9.2 % abv . it is after all in the imperial stout series . but fret not , this beer knows exactly how to handle the power . pour this big stout from its 650ml bottle into a nice deep chalice with a slight tulip to catch some of the aromas . it will flow out thick and smooth showing an oil like consistency building a black monstrous beer with a mocha tan"

S"had this out of a bomber , poured into a snifter . poured rather dark , very deep brown and nearly opaque with a 1/2 finger width head . the head did n't last too long and did not leave much lacing to speak of . before you ever pour the beer , however , you can definitely smell it . upon opening the bottle the room fills with an intense aroma of vanilla bean , caramel and butterscotch - almost reminded me of the smell of hazelnut kahlua . the smell is very strong , very rich and very sweet . in fact , even after having had this beer a few hours ago , the smell still lingers in my kitchen . there is very little hop flavor , if any at all ; the taste is mostly of butterscotch , vanilla , caramel and some milk chocolate . as the beer warmed up the alcohol taste become more pronounced and offset the balance of the caramel and vanilla flavors ; this beer is better served on the chillier side . the flavors were fairly overwhelming , tasted like i was drinking a white russian mixed heavily with kahlua as opposed to a stout beer . mouth feel was decent ; very smooth , creamy and sweet with the carbonation on the low end . coats the palate well and leaves a strong taste lingering long after the beer is finished . overall a very interesting beer . this was unlike anything i have had and i am not sure if i would be able to finish an entire bomber of this by myself without getting sick ; it is just too rich . however , it is worth at least one try for those who are curious and open minded ."

S"black with a mocha colored two finger head . retention is up high and there is a good amount of lace as well . looking in the bottle , it appears this is not bottle conditioned , and the head reflects this in terms of density . nose is full of cocoa , roasted malts , wine grapes , pear , and a dash of pepper . the smell is quite fruity and sweet , though the flavor is quite balanced in comparison . the initial taste is a mixture of chocolate and grape -- not too sweet because the roast kicks in quickly on the midpalate to balance and neutralize the sweet qualities . somewhat spicy as well , maybe a bit of leather in there , or perhaps shoe polish toward the end . bitter roast on the finish with a chlorophyll tang and a final cookielike residual affect . pretty good job of balanced sweet and roast flavors , though a few notes that were not completely harmonious in my book . full bodied with a medium , slightly higher than average carbonation . awkwardly sticky . given the fact i paid something like two bucks for a bottle of this instead of $ 6-10 for most other imperial stouts it is hard to find a leg to genuinely criticize the beer . it is good product for a more `` every day '' imperial stout . if i absolutely crave an imperial stout i could go for one of these , but it is not something i reach for much ."

S"inky black pour with little initial head . however , a sturdyish tan foam forms after a minute or so and keeps nicely . great stick , and a great look over all . similarly happy with the nose , which is powerful and complex enough for the style . i get some chalkiness among the dark chocolate , overripe fruit , and caramel . hints of molasses and herbs , lightly charred all around . very nice . the taste profile follows , with a moderate sweetness that is definitely not cloying while cold - due to the thick nature , this one could get quite sticky towards room temp . solid roast notes , with chocolate and coffee leading . oak and herbal bitterness come in toward the tail end . the strong alcohol presence is reminiscent of drinking tequila and vanilla rum . not necessarily a hugely bad thing , but this one is really hot when you stop to notice . and it 's rather easy to pass by . with its girth and velvety smooth nature , outer darkness glides right on by , and it 's in the gullet before the heat gets turned on . not a bad drinker , but its bite is worse than its bark ."

S'source/serving : 12oz . can , no expiration date . smell : ripe fruits like cherries and figs , and little yeasty , sour , cidery and vanilla . taste : like a black forest cake . initially sour but then becomes quite sweet with some cherry and ripe fruits along with brow sugar , but then this is partially balanced out by bitterness . however , a third , very interesting wave of dark chocolate dries the palette up nicely . medium body . finish lingers for a very long time and is really delicious , chocolate , bitter , and cherry . unfortunately however , as the beer warms it loses much of the interesting character except for the sweetness and becomes quite cloying . however , its quite tasty cold .'

S"purchased at canal 's discount liquors in pennsauken , nj . very shocked to see this on the shelf , could n't pass it up @ $ 1.99/bottle ... a - pours deep amber to ruby , with no haze and a short head that fades quickly leaving lotsa lacing behind . s - sour cherries and green apples . more pleasant than expected based on other reviews . t - wow . sour cherries ( talking sour patch kids ) with a mild malty background and no apparent hop presence . this is good . m - i liken this to sucking on a lemon - a bit tart at first , making you pucker and leaving a very pleasant clean tingle . nice . d - very good . i was expecting so much worse . this is an excellent beverage . i could see maybe two at a sitting , but not much more beyond that . ( kinda like you would n't drink a few coke 's in a row ) very enjoyable and will definitely purchase this again.."

S"fantastic imperial stout . extremely intense aroma of cherry and chocolate with a heavy body and wonderful taste . imagine a queen ann cherry chocolate ... in beer form and this is what you get . with an ibu of 38 , the beer is mild yet slightly bitter , but the flavors of cherry and chocolate compliment the bitterness perfectly . one of the best beers i have ever had ! only complaint would be that it is very sweet , so after 2 or 3 it 's almost too much to handle , but too much of a good thing is n't bad at all ."

S'poured from a 12oz . can that was about 40f in temperature into a 14oz room temperature ( 70f ) pilsner glass . after pouring the beer appeared deep yellow to golden with active carbination originating from the lower quarter of the glass but not quite from the very bottom . the beverage was very clear , pale to almost white near the sides of the glass while yellow to golden near center . a whisp of a head was present right after pouring and completely disappeared within moments . the beverage has a slight bitter smell leaning towards a mix of fresh cut grass and sweet corn . the beverage tastes like there is a bitter cusp of spruce or pine needles that gives way to a course , highly carbinated pang of alcohol . after the carbination expends itself the beverage becomes very watery and light . i find it easy to drink and that is why it is my cheap , working around the house turning wrenches , just finished cleaning , returned from mountain biking garage and basement beer .'

S"appearance : the beer pours light copper in color . there 's a tight white head to crown the beer and it displays superb lacing and great retention . smell : with a smooth and mild hop and malt balance in the scent it 's almost a throwback to the english roots of the style , but this is america and we 've got some fruity american hops here . if there was an american esb category , which probably is n't too far away , then i feel that this would be spot on in terms of smell . taste and mouthfeel : again i feel like avery really tried to be true to style but with just a touch of american flair . there 's a mild caramel malt base to the brew lending just a touch of sweetness and a good amount of smooth body . the hops put a zest of citrus about mid drink but the bitterness is subdued . the finish has a little touch of citrus rind but leaves little aftertaste to note . drinkability : if the abv was just a touch lower this would be a perfect session beer for me but as it stands now it 's still quite delicious and easy drinking . highly drinkable . bottom line : there 's not a whole lot of esb action going around in the us , and the examples i do find seem to be ipa bastard children so i find this beer to be a breath of fresh air ."

S'what do you mean by that ? pours a mostly hazy yellowish orange color with some amber hues throughout . a light fizzy head that did not have a good retention time and limited lacing through the tasting . the nose has more of a fruity aspect with hints of belgian aromas . to start there is a fruity aroma mostly with apricots and peaches . some lemon zest on the back end as well . some yeast notes but limited . a light rose peddle aroma and noticeable pepper notes . some noticeable hops with more of a floral , a bit much for style . next to no malt aroma . the taste is limited as well . the malt comes out versus the nose . some grainy and wheat notes but really muddled . a noticeable metallic/blood like taste that is a big deterrent for me . the fruit notes back off , with more of a mustly peach/apricot note . some pears and a touch of leather . the yeast is light as well with hints of belgian characteristics but light . the body is moderate but still easy drinking . the carbonation is light but if it was more then might hid the light malt character there is . overall there are some glaring off notes , specifically the malt , the belgian yeast character , and some water notes , but some positives with the fruity presence and drinkability .'

S"guys , i just love the name . i have n't the slightest clue what it means , but that does n't mean i do n't love it . pours just like a saison should : bright , hazed and light yellow in colour , with a very effervescent and bubbly white head . body is relatively fine and light , lace is streaming and thick . looks pretty good . nose is really bright , crisp and fresh , with a slight citric character , and more organic acidity , giving a green fragrance of crushed vegetation and mild organics . it 's milder than some of the best belgian examples , but otherwise it 's spot on . taste is also good . bright and clear , with a mild acidity and plenty of redolent green organics to lift and sparkle . very light in texture , which helps the genuinely refreshing nature of the brew . it may not be as absolutely complex and sophisticated as the best examples of this ( ironically rustic ) style , but it sure hits the nail on the head when it comes to the purpose . exceptionally drinkable and extremely refreshing . this is a brew that does a great job of distilling the best aspects of the style . i 've had three of evil twin 's beers now ( four if you include mixing the yin and yang into a yin-yang black-and-tan ) , and they are certainly a brewery worth watching . great work ."

S"i feel i should review another beer with my pal andobrew or something . let 's do it ! appearance : pours a clear , copper body with a frothy , though quickly diminishing head . andobrew , looking troubled , says it reminds him of `` scary candy . '' oh , how right he 'll be ! smell : beyond a touch of wood shavings and an indistinct orange citrus note , its sweet-smelling candy sugar through and through . andobrew concludes burton baton has been conceived and made in the same vein as avery 's `` mephistopheles and other demons '' line ( i.e. , jacked up sugar and alcohol content ) . i 'm inclined to agree with him . taste : terribly sugary , with a glaring sweetness that impairs the overall taste by laying waste to the other flavors of honey , apples , and pears . even the bitterness is cowed by the sugar . andobrew 's vote goes to `` watered down toffee brandy blended with a lil ' bit of bad news . '' right on , ando . mouthfeel : thin-bodied , but altogether cloying with a searing alcoholic warmth to it . andobrew says his mouth feels dried out and sugar-encrusted , like a `` problem . '' drinkability : essentially , i found this to be a flimsy ipa drenched in way too much sugar and alcohol . i feel fortunate to have survived this sugar-esque running of the bulls ! i wonder what beer andobrew and i will try next !"

S"definitely the worst beer in grand ridges stable , but that is not too much of a criticism . i was talking to a guy who was promoting grand ridge at the melbourne show with this and the pilsener on tap . he said that the major reason the natural blonde is pushed is because the flavour is light , easy to drink and is highly likely to enjoyed by non-beer drinkers . this seems to be a very common story in australian microbrewing . i am happy though that grand ridge 's bland beer base is strong enough that they can still create such great beers like the gippsland gold , yarra valley gold and moonshine that are supposedly too strong for the average person . anyway , considering the brief for this beer ( inoffensive taste , easy to drink ) it succeeds quite well . aroma is a definite high point - it is not particularly strong but i find the citrusy zest and slightly spicy nose enticing . taste on the other hand is way too bland . the appearance is well ... blonde and quite hazy . mouthfeel is quite carbonated and of course it is easy to drink . still , i just got a mixed case from grand ridge and i specifically told them not to include this beer ."

S'a - very clear , with a super head that dissapated quickly . left some sticking that tasted like glass . lol s - it has a funky style smells to it that kind of reminds you of a beer you broke and left in the sun . or like a hotel room after prom weekend . t/m - nothing to it at all . def union made product d - drinkability is as many as you can count because their is nothing to it at all , and its alot better than coors light'

S"i have been drinking quite a bit of this lately , probably too much ! . this beer is highly drinkable it 's name belies nothing it is a beautiful amber in the glass , and the best part is that you get every other one for free during happy hour . no real head to speak of but that takes nothing away from the brew . it 's got a very nutty , hoppy flavor that makes it go well with either the swedish meatballs , hot wings , a piece of big sandwich or a delicious flame cake ( flame cake : check out the website for a descrption , and if you are a patron at the black forest you must try it ! ) . it 's mouthfeel is very creamy and light so you can definitely polish off a few at happy hour as long as you have a dd . overall : go to farmingdale with some friends and drink this beer ."

S'poured a crystal clear yellow with a modest head that quickly reduced to a collar . the aroma was just a little skunky to start , but it warmed to a sweet corn smell . the taste was sweet , malty grain with no noticeable hop presence . the feel was light bodied with fair carbonation . drinkability was very good . solid lager , a winner as far as style goes , but not an all-star .'

S'pours a very pale yellow , would have thought this was a light beer had i not know any better . active carbonation forms a thin lacy white head . not much going on in the nose at all . maybe tiny traces of grain , corn to be specific . very bland in taste as well . is rather sweet , again , taste small traces of corn . a decent body for a macro , and i could easily put a few of these down ( not that i would want to ) . overall , not good , but not terrible . it does what it sets out to , i suppose , and that is giving the american public a beer that can go down easy and often .'

S"the pour was a medium copper red with a half finger of head that quickly dissapated to a light white ring around the edges of the beer , this hung on throughout the glass . the smell was heavy in malt sweetness , with just a hint of apricot or date . also hidden in the back of the nose was a hint of alcohol . the drink hits hard with sweet malt right up front the middle is hop bite , no , a hop oil that coats the tongue . the finish is nothing but alcohol heat . i 'm glad i finally got my hands on this one . i really think this is a good sipping beer . it 's not refreshing , nor would it go good with food . still i think i 'll get another bottle and put it up for five or eight years just to see what age does to this one . i really do n't see why they call it an ipa , it 's more of a barley wine in my opinion . if you 're looking for hops , like the 60 or 90 min . do n't look here . the alcohol and malt hide the hops , but ask me again in a few years and maybe i 'll change my review ."

S'on-tap at lagunitas a : the pour is amber , with plenty of orange , in color with a mild white head and served with a slice of lime on the rim of the glass ( more on this later ) . s : the pepper is noticeable right away . the nose is lightly fruity and earthy , sort of like an actual habanero pepper is . the spice comes through shortly after and singes the nostrils a bit . t : the pepper flavor is enormous in this beer . like the ginger ipa , the base beer is really lost and all you can taste is the flavoring . in this case , the pepper provides a lot of heat . i enjoy spicy food , but the heat along with the carbonation and beer medium altogether is just not all that enjoyable . m : the body is light to medium with a plentiful carbonation . d : this was not very good . i tried squeezing the lime into the beer and it did help to temper the chili a little bit , but it really just made the beer taste like lime and burn like a pepper . attempts at blending with the ginger ipa to make a spicy dish in beer form did not work very well either .'

S'oh yeah , drinking a great one for joeybeerbelly ! and this is da bomb ! of course , pours black as nite , with a mound of thick and rich tan marshmallow , lacing as thick as paint . for the first time , aroma like a vanilla cup cake , laced with rum . quaff is a very sweet vanilla rum ball with a chocolate coating including bits of coconut . a real desert beer , to be sure . just a hint of 10 % booze in the finish as a warm anise afterdrink . actually , this would be hard to quaff for the long haul ( over a couple hours ) , but a nice bomber on a cool fall evening .'

S"this 80 shilling scottish ale is based on the brewery 's very first beer stirling brig , 4.8 % abv . and is a weaker , organic , bottle-conditioned version . my bottle 's bb date is 01/04/06 . a : served slightly-chilled in a goblet , it pours a dark-ruby to brownish hue , with a beige , foamy beer head with good retention , leaving fine lacing along the way . s : the nose is overwhelmingly malty ... lots of sweetish dark malts , oats , calcium-pill kind of flat grainy note plus a full , even meaty note . besides the rich malty body , a refreshing tinge of slightly sour weeds and some mild hop aroma hide at the back . the complex nose reminds me of old growler by nethergate ( bottled-version ) , albeit softer . t : remarkably stimulating mouthfeel at first , followed by a refreshingly dark-malty ( not sweet ) and simultaneously tart fruity texture of black prunes and berries ; settling to a slightly bitter and quite interestingly warm aftertaste , along with chewy roasted-maltiness and a touch of chocolate 's aftertaste . m : for a 4 % abv . beer the palate is incredibly rich and the aftertaste so full and warmish , while the mouthfeel is quite lively and fresh due to bottle-conditioning . d : overall a very satisfying and complex `` small '' beer to savour , not to quaff . another decent beer by bridge of allan ! ! ! !"

S"dark gold to dirty copper in color and murky . very faint lacing for a head with some hints of prickle that can barely be seen . the nose is sharp and heavy with grain sensations . a little bit sharp on the attack and flavor with some fruit sensations that try to bail it out of being in the awful category . it seems like there was oxygen introduced into the fermentation tanks during the brewing process or that the hops were just `` dead . '' perhaps both . i am utterly disappointed at this point as this is the third of the four beers from hub city that i bought and all three have been clunkers thus far . the sweetness of the malt in this one is just not enough to compensate for the sharp and sour grain tones . disappointing ."

S'this beer smells absolutely amazing once the cap is off . it pours a nice dark stout body , with a nice tan head . the aroma on this is that of butterscotch . also in the nose are some notes of booze and even some roasted notes . the first sip of this beer is really overtaken by the aroma . very good smooth stout , however it becomes more harsh as it heats up . definitely serving it at 42 like described is a good idea . the overall taste on this beer is classic stout , some hops , loads of malt and some cream . however , the real thing here is the aroma . not a beer to drink quickly , or often . but a nice winter warmer when the snow is falling and you need some heat .'

S"a truly interesting and engaging beer . pours a ruddy amber color with a minimal off white head . some lacing in the glass . the smell is ... bourbon with a tingle of malty sweetness . the bourbon character of this beer levels you with the first sniff and does n't let go . it 's a sipper , no doubt . mouthfeel is appropriately thick and chewy . taste has some vanilla , oaky characteristics , and a nice malt backbone to go with ... gigantic bourbon characteristics . a nice combination , by all means , but i almost wish i was splitting the bottle with someone . i 'm going to have mark this beer down for drinkability , but other than that it 's a wonderfully flavorful concoction ."

S"in a quick liqour store run today i decided to give this beer a shot . the unfamiliar name and japanese characters enticed me into what was ultimately an average drink . i feel i have chosen a completely average beer with no strong characteristics in either direction . it is mild and very easy to drink , but offers no true reward to the palette . from the bottle the beer pours easily without any signs of what i consider to be excessive carbonation . the foam is attractive and substantial , being fed by many quick ant-like lines of bubbles . color is light amber with nice clean looking transparency - a very light looking beer . the smell is sweet and mild - not overpowered by carbonation - but inspires no real confidence leading into the first taste . the taste is mild and weak - like a warm citrus bitter . left over is a nutty , oily aftertaste that lingers on persistently , as if calling for another swig to exchange fresh taste with old . i ca n't definitively say that i do n't like the taste , but if offered a different beer i would not hesitate to move on . asahi super dry is a completely average beer with no truly offending characteristic . it is mild and extremely easy to drink . i prefer a low level of carbonation and in that repsect this beer gets an a . in all other respects asahi super dry earns a solid c+ . if it were cheap , i would reccomend it for beer pong because it is mild easy to drink , but at about $ 3 a pint , any real possibility of habitual purchase is absurd ."

S'not what i would call your everyday type of drinking beer . this one has way too much going on with the taste . this was actually my first beer in this style . this beer proved to be quite a brewery experiment . open air fermentation is constantly a changing environment . it poured a hazy yellowish golden hue . nice carbonation with a rather creamy white head that sticks around . smell was of sour fruit and a hint of some pale malt making for quite the tart little mixture . the story of how these beers are concocted is quite interesting . mixing and aging two beers together is a new concept for me . very interesting and i would like to try to expand my pallet . the light tone of yeast and other sweet and sour fruit linger in the nose . taste was rather sour at first but after a bit it calmed down and was actually quite drinkable . many flavors in the taste . sour apple and some tones of apricot come to mind . reminds me of a souring wine but with a dryer finish . subtle pale malt tones hidden among the sour notes . not a really noticeable hop flavor but it had some thing lingering in the background . decent mouth feel but you have to adjust to this one . my taste buds were on over time after the first sip . if you like this type of beer more power to you but my pallet may not be developed enough for this one yet . i will have to work on that . drinkable but it took some getting used too . overall this is a decent beer offering that is quite unique and very flavorful . this one is certainly not for everyone out there , but if you are looking to expand your pallet certainly give this one a try .'

S"only feeling like 1 beer tonight ... . sooo ... let 's make it a doozie.. 22 picked up today at the coop ... . it 's not retired anymore ! ! that 's good news for all of us ... poured it into a big red wine glass ... the label says 10 squared anniversary reel ale 2008 . beautiful 1 '' head leaves a ton of lace.. the brew is a rusty amber.. nose had a bunch of diacetyl when first poured.. but it gets under control as it airs out leaving quite a bit of piney hops with a more than enough caramel .. nose resembles much more an american bw than any dipa i 've come across ... so that 's the way the winds will blow on this review . great bitterness with quite a bit of caramel sweetness ... american hops are hammered home by fruity/citric notes throughout.. reminds me of what i remember baby aspirin tasting like.. or maybe flinstone vitamins.. maybe even flowery.. tough for me to describe.. still some diacetyl is there , but it does n't honestly detract.. the body is thick and coating.. and the hoppiness has a definite oily feeling.. sorta lite carbonation.. really a great brew.. i still say this should be in the american bw category.. not a dipa imho at all.. still a great brew that should be sought out . edit : i should add.. we had a couple of year old bottle at the bw tasting back in may of '08 ... i remember at least 1-2 people saying how much they liked it and how well it had aged.. that said , i wish i remember . : - )"

S"a - dark , nutty brown . small head which pretty quickly recedes to a ring of bubbles . lots of lacing , however . s - a big , bready , slightly sweetened hoppy smell . carmally and burnt-sugary with mild bitterness . t - hops kick in right off the bat , with more bitterness than i 'd expected from the smell . caramel-like malty sweetness is present too , but somewhat overpowered . a touch of chocolate , or coffee perhaps ? the aftertaste is clean hops as well , which i did n't really like . m - mouthfeel is average to pretty good ; certainly not watery . d - not my style ( and i thought this was supposed to be an esb ? ? ) . i 'm glad i tried it but i 'll probably pass on this one in the future ."

S"a- pours a hazy , deep chestnut with an ample but quickly dissipating off-white head . s- as one would expect , a burnt coffee aroma dominates . while i 'm not so sure the coffee aroma works as well with the bready sweet aroma of a doppelbock as it does with a roasty stout or porter , it 's not bad . t- a hint of coffee tinges the malty sweetness of the doppelbock that immediately hits your tongue . the malt profile of the doppelbock is excellent . not very roasty or chocolatey ( perhaps so it does n't compete with the coffee ) but nice molasses and honey notes . finishes sweet with more coffee bitterness providing the counterpoint . the hops are virtually non-existent . m- the body is exactly where you want it to be for a doppelbock ... full but not thick . d- while fans of most american doppelbocks might find this perfectly drinkable , i subscribe to the german philosophy that you should be able to drink your doppelbock a half-liter at a time , and that 's not the case with this beer . overall : this is a noble experiment and for the most part executed well . however , it seems to rely too much on the coffee to provide bitterness and the end result is a slightly unbalanced brew . coffee fans should definitely try this but overall i 'd rather have a four-pack of dark horse 's non-caffeinated doppelbock offering ."

S'light gold with a light white head . sweet corn like maltiness . thin and a bit watery , but nicely sweet corn flavor in a good way . very mild bitterness , easy drinking and a great alternative to macro stuff . no skunkiness at all was also a big plus . i could definitely drink this again when looking for cheap-ish beer to drink in quantity . nice stuff for a lager .'

S'decided to pick this one up and give it a go after a review popped up on my youtube homepage . poured from a bottle into a maudite tulip/snifter-ish glass . a very vigorous pour yields a nice fluffy beige head . head retention is decent and leaves substantial lacing . beer is dark chestnut/cola in colour , showing some faint ruby highlights when held to the light . mackintosh toffee is detected right away from the nose , as well as faint hints of dark fruits and a bit of roasted malt . nose is overall pretty subtle but very pleasant . taste is very sweet , dark fruits start come to forefront now , detecting some raisin and fig . a slightly cloying brown sugar/molasses-type flavour is apparent as well . the toffee notes are much less predominant in the taste than expect , but still present . pretty low carbonation , and a medium to thick body . not exactly my cup of tea , but it seems to be a decent example of the style given my ( very ) limited experience . rather sweet but shows some interesting complexity , would be quite enjoyable sipping inside on a blistery , cold winter evening .'

S"poured it into a pint glass . a- very true brown with a nice smooth looking tinted brown head s- smells like a good cup of coffee that has already been sweetened and had cream added . t- like a very good cup of coffee , again , but in beer form . very sweet as it goes down . m-feels like an iced latte ' in your mouth . carbonation is light and almost goes away as you swallow . d- obviously there is too much coffee here . taste is good , but is complexity too much to ask for ? wont be drinking again unless i mistake it for my morning coffee in a tired haze ."

S"appearance : very , very cloudy pear gold with yeasty chunks of god-knows-what floating around . thick , rocky , pure white head , with extremely active carbonation . collar and thick lace . good , appropriate , but a bit messy . smell : tripel 101 . stern belgian yeast funk . honey sweetness . citrus sharpness . apricot richness . taste/mouthfeel : zing ! this will wake your ass up . mouthfeel is super crisp , with a fairly light body and sharp carbonation . the flavor is slightly sweet and spicy up front , with the usual honeyed clove and corriander notes , but that 's bypassed quickly in favor of a strong lemony citrus bite . it finishes yeasty , peppery , dry and crisp , with no hint of the 8 % abv . drinkabilty : this is like lemonade on a hot summer day , so light and refreshing for a big beer ; almost like a tripel-weisse . it 's missing a lot of the mid-pallete body you might find in a top-tier trip like , say , westmalle . but unlike westmalle , which goes for almost $ 4.50 for an 11.2 , this guy cost me a whopping 99 cents . i can live with that . good beer ; great beer for the price ."

S"the dainty little cobalt blue bottle from 1997 has surfaced in san antonio at the local central market grocery store . there are cases of the stuff still available as of this date . needless to say , i had to grab a few . pours pitch black . watery ink with no head . thin , but it leaves a dark film on the sides of the glass , not unlike the dark lord does , as it 's swished in the glass . the nose catches your attention well before you make it to the rim of the glass . strong ( and i mean strong ) coffee , molasses , some chocolate , cigarette smoke , cork , and dark spirits ( think port ) . crazy flavors abound for sure . some dark , dark fruit . heavy maple syrup . really boozy . the mouthfeel is dense and thick . at first , i could n't wrap my head around this beer . i really was n't inspired by it very much . but several sips into it , i 'm singing its praises . this is really a strange and complex beast , but i 'm convinced it has a place in the pantheon of brews . not sure where , exactly , but somewhere . i rate the drinkability of this one a bit low , though , as it 's not exactly what i would call an accessible beer . it definitely wo n't appeal to many . still , this bottle is 11 years old this year , and i think it 's held up quite well over the years . i will definitely go back and grab a couple more of these and reserve them for special occasions ."

S"a friend of mine brought this back from minnesota . apparently it 's a popular macro up there . this certainly is n't bad for what it is . pours yellow with a small white head . smell is some sweet malts , maybe some corn , and surprisingly some earthy floral hops as well . taste mimics the smell pretty well . there is a nice refreshing bitterness . the mouthfeel is watery , as expected , but it has a small amount of body . nothing here inhibits drinkability in any way . i would take this over the big three any day ."

S'first of the leviathan series i have been able to get my hands on.poured into a imperial nonic a deep but not opaque black , there is some ruby tint thru out , a thinner off white head atop that never really sticks around for long.aromas were doppelbockish in my mind , deep fruit and bread-like malt along with some brown sugar and alcohol , more like a hybrid or melding of styles in the nose.great malty flavors , sweet with big raisin notes mixed with bitter chocolate and some sweetish alcohol but it doesnt burn.full and lush in the mouth its sublime but the alcohol does creep as it warms , a kick ass brew meant to be drank one at a time .'

S"11.2 oz custom brown bottle . bottled on 9/04 and best by 9/09 . $ 5.39 for the single ( pricey little bugger ) . huge puffy white head towers over my chalice , gorgeous . slowly receeds to a marshmallow-like thick meringue cap . body is a murky ruddy brown . retention and lacing are out of this world . the wonders of bottle conditioning ! smell is full of funk - straw , oak , farmhouse , vinegar , and bark . taste does n't quite live up to what i expected . all in all subdued taste - light in taste . chalky , leathery , lightly bitter . slight sour aspects but not much . really underwhelming . mouthfeel , on the other hand , is superb . medium thickness , outstanding creaminess and richness . it 's not that i have trouble finishing this one - it 's simple enough to drink quickly - but i 've no desire to get another bottle ( especially considering the price ) . it 's good , but not the be-all , end-all brew i was hoping for . glad i tried it once , but that 's going to be all for me ."

S"big beer series ? i 'll say . poured into a tall , more 'flute-shaped ' snifter with a deep solid dark honey brown body and a nice tan one finger head to cap it . this beer smells incredibly sweet . i ca n't exactly put my finger on . it 's very fruity and sugary , even . any hops presence is muted by the incredibly wheaty profile of the wheat wine . the bar i had this beer at listed it at 12 % abv and you certainly notice it . great beer to have if your in the mood for something big ."

S"08 vintage , review from notes on 1/1/10 . poured into my trusty snifter . pour is jet black with a nice brown head . medium full body , with a smooth and surprisingly thin mouth feel at first . rich dark chocolate notes upfront balanced with a mellow espresso bitterness . rich dark cherry notes and a sweet malt presence throughout . despite a mild bitterness , it is quite balanced and finishes with a rich and creamy mouthful with a warming bourbon presence . towards the very end , the thick motor oil sediment comes out and ups the richness factor and thickens the body . alcohol is present but very enjoyable , certainly does n't taste as strong as it is . almost like two beers in one . overall a perfect beer for new years day , glad it had some age on it , because the flavors were still punching me in the face ."

S'this is the very best imperial stout i personally have ever tasted . now.. the first bottle i had was fresh , and had not ferminted in the bottle.. this last one i had i kept in the basement for about one year ( thats some self control people ) ... . i chilled it to about 45 degrees , it was black no see through.. no ruby no color , a beautiful tan cream of a head on top ... smells like cinnamon rolls to me . starts out chocolate , coffee . then the bourbon bite . abv is a bit over powering thats why i gave it 4.0 on drinkabilaty , but over all , this must be what imperial stout was meant to be like . ( besides being aged in old bourbon barrels )'

S'thanks to fartingdog for this bottle a - this ale pours a hazy amber golden brown with a bog fizzy pure white head that dissipates to a rim quickly , tons of side-streaming carbonation s - oak is the first element of the aroma that hits my nose , followed by vanilla , the alcohol , and some dried fruits , but this last element is only the faintest of hints t - a great woody/vanilla/toffee taste again hits first , this beer definitely benefited from those oak barrels , also in the flavor is alcohol and lots of it , the inherent abv , plus the bourbon rears its head . as you taste it , the alcohol fades and mellows to a sweet flavor as the other flavors step forward . as the beer sits for a while , it seems to get woodier , which is definitely welcome m & d - a bit harsh of an alcohol kick , so it need to be drank carefully , but the flavors are darn good , once it sits for a while it gets even better and smoother , a nice brew , thanks again fartingdog , never could pull the trigger on this one in the store , im too cheap barrel-aged=good'

S"the thing that really jumped out at me about this beer is the color . when held up to the light , it has the most amazing deep red . i 'm sure that can be attributed to the raspberry . but can almost be achieved without , like with sammy irish red . the taste is more strawberry than raspberry , and to me it tasted like strawberry soda . i 'm sure it will be a hit with the ladies who think they are beer drinkers . that being said , i did n't think the strawberry flavor was overpowering . it was very pronounced and i could n't taste the ale , but no , not overpowering ."

S"enjoyed at a tasting on 06/18 w/ fellow baer proteus93 . poured into an ommegang chalice . appearance : thick , black motor oil . i 've described beer as looking like motor oil before , but i had no idea what i was talking about . this beer is motor oil . the head is a deep , deep khaki-colored that fades fast . this is one fierce-looking beer . aroma : very intense . powdered , sweet carob bean melds with pungent , spicy alcohol to lend a strong chocolate liqueur aroma , and other highly-toasted malts - italian roast coffee , something that smells like cat food to me - easily oppress some mild earthy hops . crazy good . taste : my notes on this one say `` i 'm scared . '' the smell is very intimidating . some good dark fruits that did n't come through in the aroma are present here - a friend notes that , in conjunction with the chocolate , it tastes like liquid raisinets . agreed . hop bitterness is more prominent here , or perhaps it 's bitter chocolate . earthy indonesian coffee is still prominent , as are other various malts - deep toffee , burnt sugars , bready barley . there 's also some solvent-like alcohol throughout , particularly in the finish . very extreme - over the top , even - but it 's very well balanced and very tasty . mouthfeel : thick , syrupy , sticky , viscous . coats the inside of your mouth in greasy , oily goodness . like drinking molasses . intense . drinkability : it goes down easy , but watch yourself on this one - this beer will knock you on your ass . as i 've mentioned several times , this beer is thoroughly intense , so take it slow , take it easy , and pair it with something . a beer you 'll probably only get to enjoy once , if at all , given its limited release and that its retired and all . once is n't enough in the long one , but once at a time is . a very well-crafted but over-the-top beer . if you can find it , try it ."

S"i was delighted to see this at a grocery in champlain , ny along with several other goodies . pours a mild copper with a one-finger head into my glass . i have no qualms about the color . mildly hoppy ( for something with 113ibus ) with just a hint of citrus , grassiness and biscuit-y malt . lingering grassiness and biscuit malt dominate the mouthfeel . it 's not the best ipa i 've ever had in a can but it 's certainly a good thing to have on a hot day ! i want to see more examples of this style in a can ! for this reason , i have to give the appropriate props ."

S'aroma : lemon zest , grass , some grapefruit , orange peel . looks : almost clear . nice copper/amber colour . needed a vigorous pour to produce an average sized head . good head retention . foam was a creamy , off-white colour . good amount of lace left behind . taste : bitter , but balanced by the malts . grassy flavours . flavours of citrus rind , endives , grass . upon first entering my mouth i could taste some malty flavour , but that was quickly overcome by the hop bitterness & flavours . long bitter finish . mouthfeel : slightly lower than average co2 . on the heavier side of medium bodied . overall , a good beer . however i would not pay $ 8.00 for another bottle , as i could find many similar tasting beers for a more modest price ... that said i would still reccommend trying it at least once .'

S'blackish ruby under a chocolate cream with a roasty , charred aroma . begins with a quick twang of black malts , before giving way to a bitter chocolate . roastedness grows until it reaches a full espresso expression . oily smokiness appears as it warms . not much besides dryness in terms of hops . light bodied , detrimentally so while cold ( and it is consistently served much too cold ) . gains weight as it heats , much to its benefit . inexplicably easy to consume . beyond sessionable . a light-hearted yet interesting-enough stout that is about perfect considering the climate and location .'

S"got on tao at mack 's golden pheasant in elmhurst , il . appearance- given to me with a sturdy tan head that started at two and a half fingers , and eventually receded to a one and a half finger head that stayed the whole enjoyment of beer . color is a deep brown when held to the light , but other than that its a translucent black . looks a lot like guiness . smell- pretty subdued in every way . what stabds out the most is a tart , deep roasted malt aroma . with hints of heavy cream , coffee , and chocolate . taste- a dry mlat start that slowly got creamier . this creaminess went from heavy cream to a chocolate finish mixed with some dry hops . mouthfel- a rich stout flavor , but helped wash down my burger . a good dry , creamy presence remained on the palate after the last sip of beer was done for the evening ."

S'slightly hazed red ochre with a two finger thick head of rocky foam that lingers long . aroma of bright citrusy hops . flavor initially of big hops , lots of orange peel and grapefruit , morphing to pine . malt slowly emerges , inserts some notes of caramel and dark bread , and then gets pushed back down again by assertive hops and aggressive bitterness . distinct abv warmth . mouthfeel is even , but has moderate carbonation , lots of tingles and warmth from hops and alcohol . average drinkability . tasty beer , but perhaps a bit out of balance for the style ? thanks to barleywinefiend for sending this one my way .'

S'just a massive tan head greeted me upon the pour . a hazy , lazy amber orange brown by the end of the bottle , after swirling , became almost ruddy brown . nice . sweet wheaty malts with subtle hints of clove and banana in both the aroma and quaff . a tad disappointed in the weakness of the spices i thought they would be more pronounced . the weakness carried over to the mouth , weak , and thin , with low carbonation . however , this did not distract from the overall drink ability this one is smooth and enjoyable . it works for a cross-over and a steady session brew !'

S'ive been drinking a lot of heavier beers lately , and with the weather turning much warmer and spring-like this weekend , i just really craved watered-down crap beer . i knew i didnt want much of it , and luckily the six pack shop had the 25.3 oz oil cans . perfect . enough to satisfy my craving . and satisfy it did . appearance : light yellow beer with a very large , white , frothy head that clings to the glass as it dissipates , leaving nice lacing early . smell : eh ... not as bad as a lot of the other macro adjuncts , but still pretty bad . kind of smells like piss , but under that it smell faintly of hay and citrus ( i could actually detect hops in an adjunct ? nah i must be dreaming ) . not much else there . taste : pretty typical at first . fizzy water with a slight breadiness . a tiny bit of hops over a very weak malt backdrop . the finish is dry and clean with this small piney tinge well after it goes down . while i was finishing the beer off , i read the alstrm brothers reviews . todd said that the beer goes tea-like in flavour , and i just had to say that i never thought or comparing a beer to tea , but hes dead-on right there . mouthfeel : again , fizzy water . very light body . lively carbonation . drinkability : for what it is , i think its really refreshing . ill take this over most a-b , coors , or miller products any day . i know i didnt give this high ratings at all , but its one of my highest ranked adjuncts ( the bastardization of beer ) .'

S"reviewed from my notes ; poured at the great lost bear . i was at the bar reading through andy crouch 's good beer guide to new england and was impressed with what he had to say about andrew 's . i was inspired to order myself a pint , as this is a another readily available local beer that i often pass over for something more exotic . i 'm really glad i gave it the consideration it deserves . the beer has a good-sized tan head that recedes with great lacing . the liquid is a beautiful shade of orange . very little carbonation is visible within the glass . except that is has been presented to me in a 12 ounce glass instead of an imperial pint , this is a perfect british style pale . the aroma has a very subtle hop presence with a bit of whole grain maltiness . the pale malts up front make up most of this beer 's flavor , but the amarillo hops bring in a slight fruit juice flavor ( without any distracting corn syrup flavors ) . t ends with a subtle hop bite that grows in intensity after i swallow . this is a fine english pale . the beer has a medium body and low carbonation levels . there is a small coat that is ever so slightly sticky . there is nothing off-putting here . this is a great session beer . i should really drink this more often . the subtleties of this beer are easily overshadowed by maine 's more adventurous ( allagash , marshall wharf ) and better funded ( shipyard , gritty 's ) brewers , but this is an exceptional brew . if british session beers were as popular as the average russian imperial stout , people would be lining up at andy 's door for this beer . highly recommended ."

S"courtesy of jwiss22 in an excellent trade ... poured in my sam adams perfect pint glass . a nice golden copper color with a luscious 3 finger white head . not getting the big lacing i expected , but it still looks great . the sweet bready malt is light and fresh -- like a small bakery from 30 feet away . nice citrus hops smell clean and full of potential ... the beer tasted good . well , better than good , but not quite incredible ... perhaps a shade under `` great. '' . the malt sweetness starts off , only to be cut short by the hoppy goodness ... . then the malts interrupt again and take us home on the finish . there is a decent bitterness that briefly lingers , but is n't overpowering . the finish is actually pretty nice . the beer ends up being a little hop-forward while maintaining a balance worthy of mass appeal . the body and mouthfeel are spot on . just right . this thing has great drinkability . just right for having more than a couple ! !"

S"pours dark as unsweetened chocolate , gives off ruby highlights like an lbv port wine when held to the light . creamy beige colored foam adorned the top of the beer but disappeared too quickly leaving behind only a thin film . an elegant bead emerged from the glass for the duration of the assessment . 1st smell yielded aromas of malt , demererra sugar , alcohol and faint aniseseed . quite pleasant ! in the follow-up semi-sweet chololate and hints of toffee could be detected along with distant odors of smoke and black cherries . this is a beautifully complex beer . medium to full bodied beer , fully textured and creamy as it dispersed in my mouth . the tastes were as varied as the aromas . toasted cereal , malt , alcohol and fruit ( cherries , raspberries , and bananas ) all were followed by bitter chocolate in the back . the aftertaste was a long , powerful and sustained bitterness , reminescent of a good barleywine , accompanied by mild tartness . huge finish ! very enjoyable beer as a desert or nightcap . complex , big and flavourful , easy to pin down its different smell and flavour components . gains a great deal of complexity as it warms from cellar temp . to room temp . i have two left ... will miss them when they 're gone ( not available in montral ! that 's a crime )"

S"yuck ! ! ! i had this beer on tap an thought it was da ' bomb , but then i bought some cans and ... blech ! basically i bought a six pack of diacetyl -- a big glass full a ' butta ' , that 's what i bought . disgusting . not sure what to do with the rest of the cans ( i will try to get a refund ) . hey oskar , ever hear of a diacetyl rest ? ? ? ugh ! i really feel nauseated . no joke . this might have been the worst beer experience of my life ( and the only reason i drank half a can of this swill is because i was hoping that it would begin to taste like i knew that it was supposed to taste ... like when i had it on tap ) . no dice . this six is for sh*t ."

S"12oz into chouffe tulip . 2010 bottling . a- an amazing pour.. deep ruby red highlights in a dark brown beer . a salmon-colored head that laces nicely . 2 fingers but fizzes out . s- cherries ! t- cough syrup cherry tidal wave . capri sun cherry flavor . i have reason to believe this was brewed with real cherries , so it 's a shame they are coming across like this . it 's not terrible , it 's not robitussin ... but it 's no cherry pie either . stale flavors are peeking through the cherry avalanche . m- thick , heavy , pancake syrupy . no sign of abv , but this elixer does n't resemble a beer either . d- low ... there 's a few flavors that draw me out of what has the potential to be a stellar beer . needs some serious tweaking . each sip i would tell myself it 's not that bad , and then the stale flavors would hit me for a second , and then they 'd be gone . a befuddling beer ."

S'pours an amber red with moderate bubbles and a quickly fleeting head . leaves some lacing . smell is of sugary malt and fruity esters that get punished by cascades . good deal of citrus rind , grass , and pine . fruity malts mix well with the cascade punch in the flavor , and there is a moderate bitterness in the finish . not over the top , but good . mouthfeel is smooth and soft with its carbonation and has a medium body . like most saint arnold beers , there is a stickiness in the mouth . decent enough ipa , but for some reason , this just make me want to drink a ton of it .'

S'this beer pours a clear light golden yellow color , with a thin white head . the head fades slowly , leaving a pretty decent lacing . this beer has a mildly hoppy aroma . it isnt as strong as i expected . it smells floral , with a touch of pine . it has a slightly sweet aroma also . this beer tastes exactly like it smells . it is more of a pale ale than an ipa . not hoppy at all . this beer is carbonated well . it leaves a sweet malty aftertaste . this beer may make a decent session beer . lowish alcohol , and a decent flavor make it ok . overall : i dont think this beer was much of an ipa . it is a decent beer , however rating on style , this beer is not that great . i am sorry .'

'' not your father 's wheat beer '' well of course not i doubt he ever tatsed one ! anyway on to the beer . poured into the glass its an attractive cloudy light orange..tiny head that goes fast . for an american `` hefe '' this aroma is terrific..all the banana , spice and fruitiness..with a nice sour wheat smell..very nice . mm also a nice tasting hefe..all the above with a hint of cloves..slightly bitter finish . very good on the palate an exceptionally drinkable american style hefe..excellent in the sun . this has to be the best american shot at the style..the brewer at mactarnahan 's is askilled craftsman ."

S"i have very mixed feelings approaching this brew again . for one , when i first came of legal drinking age , this was the first brown ale that i enjoyed . and for me , that really means something when it comes to this underappreciated style . 'brown ' . certainly does n't sound appealing as a descriptive adjective . sounds more like an adjective appropriate for describing feces ! oh how its name has doomed it to neglect ! oh how its glorious balance of flavors has determined itself to be forgotten in place of the dominant american ipa ! somehow i find the best of these ales unbelievably delicious and drinkable . and with a bit of trepidation i cautiously proceed onwards to my review ... appearance : compared to good ole newkie , this beer really shines . it has nearly the exact same hue ( light brown/amber , wholly transparent ) , but it generated and maintained head much better than its paradigm . there was also some moderate lacing on the glass . took quite a while to dissipate . smell : caramel/toffee sweetness , and buttery aroma ( diacetyl no doubt ) . the light diacetyl is not unwelcome to me : i invite it with open arms to the care of my olfactory senses . taste : the key to this beer is balance . where newkie brown fails , this beer succeeds . the flavor opens up with some very mild bitterness , balanced between the hops and the light roastiness of the chocolate malt . also some mild fruitiness from the esters . here , the bitterness of both elements lingers more and balances the light toffee and nutty flavors . mouthfeel : the beer is medium bodied with some fairly mild carbonation appropriate to the style . this is what i think of when i think of 'brown ' ! if the mouthfeel is not perfection then it 's damn near close to it ! drinkability : as i 've written before , the key to browns is balance . here the sum is greater than all the parts . the result is a very drinkable northern brown ale : not too hoppy , not to sweet . not too nutty , not too thick . just right . yeah ."

S'a - a fairly dark inviting amber hue with a thick foamy head s - upon initial nosing one can easily be confused by what can only be described as what would be the result of smoking fish wrapped in bacon in a fireplace.. and then attempting to eat the bacon-fat soaked embers t - every year in memphis there is an international barbeque festival in which hundreds of lucky pigs are bless to be a party to , which for a pig would be tantamount to nirvana . the oversized smokers employed by the pitmasters accrue a healthy amount of grease in the traps underneath which are not much more than residue of charred wood and rendered flesh of some of the luckiest pigs in the world . if you were to empty the collective contents of every smoker at the festival into a single vat , and then decant a single portion into a pint glass , the result would be indistinguishable from schlenkerla fastenbier . m - medium feel , well-carbonated . i find that this works rather well with the taste and profile of this beverage . d - though this is a highly interesting style and expression of a rauchbier , it is not something that i would want to partake in more than once or so in a given month , and only in the winter months at that .'

S'2008 , batch 6 , 16.31 % abv an interesting beer , so strong i tasted the bottle in two sittings first tasting was so , so overwhelming . all i could taste was massive alcohol and insane amount of malt richness . on second tasting , a day or two later , the rest of the bottle ( which was recapped and colder this time ) was much better . very smooth . it reminds me of port wine , so incredibly intense . i can pick up raisins , dark roasted grain , and a nice bit of hops in the aftertaste . i recommend gently sloshing the beer around in your mouth to let your palette pick up all of the nuances . to me , there was much more complexity when tasted it like this . overall , i would say it was too much . a great experiment in excess but for strong dark beers i prefer something around 8-9 % alcohol . above that , and the alcohol dominate too much for my taste .'

S'the pour displays a highly carbonated body producing three fingers of foamy , white head . head retention is very good . the body is a very clear amber color . the nose starts off with a fresh , pear aroma along with sour apples . wheat malt smells are minimal . a clove spice adds some tingling feelings in the nose . light fruit flavors start this weizen with fresh apples and pears . fruit flavors are long and last throughout an entire sip . hints of spice hit at the midpoint and are quickly backed by a sweet , wheat malt flavor . yeast flavors are noticeable but minimal . the mouthfeel is highly carbonated and paired with a very dry finish after each sip . drinkability is very good . there are much better wheat beers but this is quite refreshing . an excellent hot weather beer .'

S"2004 vintage pours a red copper color with no head and no lacing at all . very light carbonation forms a tiny ring around the rin of my samichlaus tulip . aroma is woody and vinous , with alcohol bringing up the rear . dark cherries and plums fill the nose , as well as a hint of vanilla . very complex and enjoyable . flavor tastes of tobacco and leather . solidly bitter finish , with flavors of caramel developing in the midpalate . large sherry flavors , and very reminiscent of dry marsala wine . again , very complex , and could use some time to mellow out even more . mouhfeel is slightly astringent and light drinkability is somewhat low , due to the alcohol warming and harsh bitterness . even being two years old , i think this beer needs at least another 2 to mellow out fully . i 'd like to see some more sweetness in an old ale , and more body as well . this beer was obviously designed to age , and i feel that it needs to . the other three bottles from this 2004 six pack will be sitting in my cellar for a while i think ."

S"very interesting about how this beer is brewed in the review below . some techniques i 've never heard of . any way . this is a 2005 vintage . i 've been sitting on this bottle for about a year and a half not wanting to open it because it is one of the most expensive bottles i have bought . read below about the vintage . pours a completely flat dark caramel color . more like a light brown maple syrup . the bottle is awesome though and it makes you feel like your opening something revolutionary . aroma is tons of dark fruits . i have never had a beer with more dark fruit aroma . mostly rasin . tons of toasted sugars and caramel . very complex . wow . taste . i do n't know what to say . it 's like sucking on a part maple part simple syrup solution . sooo sweet . it 's amazing that there is no alcohol burn . absolutly zero . and my bottle is 13 % . abv . it 's way too sweet though . but the flavors are nice . mouthfeel is actually not as thick as i was expecting . the non existent carbonation actually probably helps out the mouthfeel because it would probably taste too thick if there was some carb . overall it is way too sweet and is gunna be hard to finish . i should have brought this to a tasting and not split it with a buddy . would have felt better to split a $ 50 bottle of beer with more people and we probably would have enjoyed it more since a couple sips and you have had enough ."

S"labelled as bass premium ale in the uk , this beer comes in a 500ml brown bottle . pours a mid amber colour with a big bubbly off-white head , that quickly disperses to a thing film , leaving little to no lacing . aroma was malts , slightly spicy and smoky , hint of hops and cucumber . taste was malts , more malts , and a sort of pimms-esque watery fruit follow on . small bitter finish . bubbly mouthfeel , luckily this beer drinks well . overall i was somewhat disappointed by this beer , i 'd expect a better body to the beer and a flavour packing more of a punch ."

S"holy hops . holy well balanced hops . first off let me say this is the most amazing apa/ipa i 've ever laid my tastebuds on . if you 're a hophead you must seek this out . a note on the hops - as you might expect by the name , all 3 hop varietals came from the southern hemisphere ... specifically new zealand . more interesting info from sn 's pressrelease : http : //www.sierranevada.com/about/news.html # southern my sample was from a 16oz bottle at cellar temp . the appearance is bold . colossal , chunky , sticky , billowy head . not a gusher but a incredibly strong head that 's built 3 fingers high - and sits around for the duration . lacing - ha ! the lacing is big beautiful globs of head sticking to the sides of the glass allll the way down . the beer 's color is a rich gold and just slightly opaque - could massive hop oil contribute or is that simply colloidal activity ? the smell very pleasantly grassy at first , green grass and cut grass , secondary floral notes , and some spicy aroma as well . very big on the nose . not surprisingly , the taste is big hops very very well balanced with a creamy malty backbone . lots of delicate floral and citrus hop flavors . the mouthfeel was big but not overly full with some slight hop slickness . fantastic brew - i wish i 'd picked up a couple more ."

( hears the move theater yell , `` run you idiot , run !

S"poured out of a pounder can . 6 bucks for a sixer of pounders apperance : pale gold with a suprisingly nice one finger head . this head thinned down , but actually stuck around for the entire beer . beer seems to be exceptionally carbonated , which adds to it 's appeal . beer also has some cling-age as it goes down , which is another suprise . actually looks decent ... wow smell : not much . metal is the strongest scent , probably cause of the can ... some hops and malts ... but barely there at all . taste : crisp , carbonated , and void of any strong flavors . like carbonated spring water with fresh cereal grain , thin malt , and oily hop flavors . refreshing and smooth . just enough flavor . mouthfeel : thin and airy , but doesnt leave a bad aftertaste so ... i guess it 's decent . drinkability : this shit goes down the hatch . if i wanted to drink alot of beers , this would be a great choice . alright , this is what a macro-lager should be . there are no amazing flavors , but that 's to be expected . most importantly , what little flavor it does have , is pleasant . it also smooth and refreshing . nice work coors"

S"yep , that 's right . could n't pass up this 8.5 % beauty . hard to get a higher abv in my neck of the woods . how bad can it be ? well , the counter wench dropped it as she was putting it into my bag because she was real busy with a phone call . i think that 's what caused this huge head i 'm looking at . big white and fluffy . if not for the 'someone did n't flush in the middle of the night ' color , i might think i had a decent brew . smell is of faint metallic grain . thankfully not strong enough to be disgusting , but not pleasing at all . y'know , this does n't taste half bad . actually the aftertaste is a little on the nasty side , but the initial flavor is decent . hard to put my finger on it ; corny malty , slightly boozy , grainy . not delicious , but i wo n't need to pour any out . says very smooth lager right on the can and it definitely approaches smooth . i 'm not a big fan of the style but this has to be one of the smoothest there is . good bang for the buck too . i would get this again if the proper alignment of low funds , poor selection , and time crunch presents itself . overall : i do n't hate it"

S'there was a temple just down the street ... bro . arrives a crystal clear lemony yellow color . a soft white head with limited retention that quickly hid to the edge of the glass . not much lacing really to speak of . the nose was mostly malt notes . more on par as a premium lager or helles ( versus macro lagers ) . a grainy aroma with noticeable 2 row smells . some toasty and light caramel notes but light . a light hop note with a more earthy and spicy aroma with a more german twang to it . some yeast notes but for the most part clean , but a light butter note . the taste drops off compared to the nose . the grainy notes come out nicely but there is a bit of a wispy note . would have like to see more malt notes coming out . some minor toasty and biscuit notes . the bitterness comes out a bit more than finishing hops and lingers into the finish . some minor hop spicy hop notes but would like to see more . the butter notes come out a bit more versus the nose and really is a deterrent . the body is light and really lacking . a bit watery , i would like a bit more depth . some astringency bite from bitterness which is enhanced by a bit of carbonic bite . overall a decent beer but just lacking a bit more sole . and would like to see less butter . not a bad summer beer though .'

S"pours opaque brown-black , with purplish highlights . virtually no head . aroma of port wine and grapes . i was disappointed in this beer at first , because it certainly did n't fit my expectations of a porter , and i was expecting something `` bigger . '' but it grew on me a little bit . it has a mildly sharp sweetness up front , with that nice ale mustiness hitting the back of the palate . it tasted almost like a tart tripel , though it drinks something like a wine . it 's not traditionally malty , and not very hoppy . not great , but enjoyable in its own way ."

S"a - a beautifully thick , rich , fig brown , hemmed by an orangey hue . s- offers an array of berries - cassis , cranberry , blueberry - that hang distractingly from a subtle malt background , manifested through soft wafts of caramel . the hops hides somewhere between the two - barely distinguishable . t - let it be noted that the following is a revised draft of my original review , in which i bashed the taste pretty severely at first - accusing it of being unbalanced , and ultimately ruined by an ambush of hops on the finish . however , although an aspect of this asymmetry still exists , allowing the beer to reach almost room temperature massively improved the experience , and so i 'll conclude the following : the fore and mid palates present the berry complexity displayed by the nose , although relatively short-lived . malt and spice lead forth , exhibiting sticky toffee pudding , and spices - particularly nutmeg - with some resinous pine wandering along the edge . hops finally take center stage for the finale , which , although welcoming , seems to fail in its attempt to fully integrate , and eventually results in a disappointingly detached and unbalanced final quality . m - the viscosity reflects the visual density , while the higher-end medium carbonation breaks-up some of the malty stickiness . d - pretty good , but lacks the abv to really tackle the stickiness of the malt . one an evening is definitely enough ."

S'the color and life of cloudy flat dr. pepper . i obviously drew the short straw on this bottle and got something with no carbonation . no head , no lace , no carbonation . lifeless . aroma and taste make up some for the poor appearance . lots of cherries , some oak , some acetone from the alcohol . the taste is phenomenally complex . tart , a bit of alcohol in the middle , cherries and oak , finishing a bit buttery with a mild bitterness . due to the absence of carbonation , mouthfeel was flat . the only thing keeping the rating above 1 was the medium body . i am saddened that i was cursed with a sub-par example of this beer , made all the more painful due to the hefty price tag ( $ 16 for 375ml ) . i am sure that with a bit of carbonation this is a world class brew ( or with a bit more alcohol a great port like fermented beverage ) . perhaps one day , i will venture back to the north county to try cuvee de tomme again . until then , i am left with the memory of what may be the poorest value beer i have ever purchased .'

S"update 3/4/11 : what the hell happened to my weizen eisbock ? poured into an eisenbhan wiezenbock glass , the color is the same , but there 's better head retention . the aroma is more boozy and grapey , but i can still make out those weizenbock charactersitcs . the taste is where it goes downhill ; lots of uber-sweet raisin flavored alcohol dominate with the clove and banana bread tastes pushed way aside . mouthfeel remains very likeable , big , syrupy , and smooth , not too boozy in this respect , and sticky around the mouth . damn , this is too sweet ; i 'm going to struggle to finish the 330 ml serving . this bottle was a 2010 vintage ( costing $ 5.49 ) , so perhaps it needs a little more time to be outstanding . or perhaps my tastes have changed so much since my last sampling nearly 4 years ago . i 've had my helping of aventinus classic in between that time , and i 'll be more than happy to drink that in the future . ( 4/23/07 ) this better be good . i spent $ 5.19 for an 11.2 oz . bottle at town and country liquor , and it has a printed number on the back of the label . it says 2005/11325 on the back of the label . well , the moment has come to try it out : dark red to brown in color , it 's an eye catcher , but where 's my head ? i barely got one when it was poured , and it quickly went down . but that 's okay , i enjoyed everything else this brew had to offer . have you ever tried to mix a doppelbock with a hefeweizen and an eisbock ? that 's the best way to describe this beer . it has that delicate yeasty , phenolic , fruity flavor of hefe 's , the chocolate maltiness and raisins flavors of a doppelbock , and that body warming kick of a eisbock . all of this creates an extremely well-balanced brew , an incredibly smooth texture , and the defying drinkablilty which begs me to have another of these . at 12 % abv , you better watch how much you drink of this , but it 's so damn good . if this review could n't get any better , i now know i can find this at quite a few establishments , and cheaper too . hooray ! original rating : 3.5/5/5/5/5"

S'date : 05/25/2010 type : 750ml . bottle vintage : 2009 glassware : usual portsmouth tulip poured a nice charcoal black w/ a 1/2 finger light brown creamy head w/ minimal lacing . nose was fantastic , w/ aromas of chocolate malts , light coffee , black licorice , slight smokiness , and a touch of earthy peat . taste was excellent as well , w/ notes of dark chocolate , vanilla bean/marshmallow , and a finish of substantial hop bitterness . this brew contained a flavor in the middle that took me awhile to pinpoint , eventually i realized it was burnt toffee mixed w/ star anise . mouthfeel was pretty viscous and oddly pillowy at the same time . the only negative on this brew for me was the sweetness , that got to me after only a 12oz . glass . to be honest , it kind of sadened me because it overshadowed the amazing complexity of this fine brew . overall , i thoroughly enjoyed this brew , but could only handle drinking a 4-8oz . pour . the next time i crack one of these bad boys open , it will be w/ other ba friends .'

S'caged and corked 750 ml brown bottle with a production date listed as 05-05-2004 aroma : the nose is a cornucopia of wonderful fruits . grapes , pineapple , lemon , apple , and grapefruit ; the beers has a definite floral edge with an overall clean bright fresh smell . has a small herb/spice note as well , maybe coriander and/or sage . i can refrain from downing the whole chalice only with extreme effort . appearance : hazy , almost murky orange glass with a short lived , large bubbled whitish head . flavor : spices really pop in the mouth . pepper and coriander wrap the classic unibroue yeast taste . some of the fruits come in as well , mainly the lemon/orange and the grape . once warm , the alcohol makes a minor appearance , but only to accent the fruit and yeast . ambrosial mouthfeel : medium body with strong carbonation at first pour , moderate at third pour . very numbing and leaves a good oily coat . overall impression : stuff of the gods ! a truly enjoyable brew . fruity , vinous like a fine white wine , classic unibroue yeast with a blend of spices and fruit that really makes for an enjoyable mini-session . snatch and stash i say ! most highly recommended !'

S"750ml bottle from the original 2004 release with michael jackson 's rare beer tour . served in a tasting tulip at just over fridge temperature and paired with chaumes veritable from france . appearance- pours an attractive fiery deep amber , loud and hissing ... the head fights to climb a few inches , but does n't even remain paper thin after a minute . a few dots of lacing , without any retention . smell- mature , full hop nose that carries a backbone of vanilla and wood from the oak aging . taste- this beer incorporates a boozy , almost whiskey cask flavor that intensifies the citrus finish . a woodsy tartness is evident throughout the time spent inside the mouth , coating the teeth and drying the palate . mouthfeel/drinkability- with the most subtle carbonation , the texture expands marginally to add some body to the deep , oaky flavors here . this is not an easy beer to savor , sip , or swig ... but it 's an adventure nonetheless . i would have loved to have tried this pre-storage just to compare ."

S"pours out a woody orange-brown with a creamy , sturdy , off-white head that clings to the sides of the glass . smell is very `` worty '' with big emphasis on dark bread , raisins , and brown sugar . some mild belgian-esque esters poke around in the back . taste is big on brown sugar and dried fruits with a faint fresh fruitiness in there somewhere . hops are mild but pleasantly herbal . there 's a slight acidity on the sides of the tongue . kind of too sweet for me . mouthfeel is lightish with a definite sticky characteristic . carbonation is mellow . this is a tasty beer but the sweetness gets to be too much . i think i 'd like this a whole lot more if it was better attenuated ."

S"bottled 1/2/4 , batch 2 , bottle 93 . dated and signed by the brewer on the beautiful bottles with the damn near impossible to uncork corks . instead of screwing around like i did the last time i opened a humdinger i went straight to the corkscrew and this time it came out well , no cork pieces flotting around . appearance : copper reddish , a lot more translucent than i expected , with light grey tan head that died down fast . a little bit of brownish yeast deposits were found in the bottom of my glass . smell : earthy , woodsy , caramel and alcohol . terms i would use more often to describe a scotch , but in a beer ! i did detect some hops in there as well . taste : first of all , the alcohol rises from your mouth and through your nose as you take a sip . it 's very oaky and dry , with a nice alcohol aftertaste . they ai n't joking when they say this stuff was aged in bourbon casks . drinkability took somewhat of a hit not because i did n't like it , but the price tag ( 20+ us $ ) is a little prohibitive . if you like sherry cask whiskeys , go for it , because this stuff looks , smells and tastes like it , but with a little carbonation . if bourbon is n't your thing , pass ."

S'750 ml . bottle . interesting beer . poured a nice color red . slight pink head . flavor was a classic witbier with just a touch of pinot , not overbearing , but you notice it there in the background . the alcohol is almost impossible to detect . easy to drink and a nice twist / change for a wit . putting one in the cellar for a future tasting .'

S'the hazy orange / amber hued brew is topped by a fairly dense ivory - white head that leaves a decent lace down the glass . cherry absolutely overwhelms the aroma and is quite overbearing ... any other malt notes or hop nose is completely masked . the taste is also dominated by a cloying cherry extract flavor , and as the beer warms an odd marzipan flavor becomes noticeable . this beer is an epitomy of inbalance -- the fruit extract prevents the malt profile to surface . finishes sweet , w/ a lingering offputting sugary cherry candy sweetness . there are fruit beers that are drinkable ... this is not one of them .'

S'enjoyed on tap at miller park from a compostable corn polymer cup . poured a bright , golden-copper body with a fluffy white head that fell slightly and remained all the way to the last sip . aroma is balanced between sweet malts and floral hops . medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation to be refreshing , this beer tasted sweet with a slight nuttiness and faint hop finish . excellent drinkability , it was the perfect full-flavored beer to have while watching a baseball game .'

S"a- this pours a somewhat foggy gold color with an impressive head that dissapeared almost instantly and with a loud fizzy sound , just like a can of pop ... and really no lacing to speak of . s- there is n't much of an aroma , but what i can pick up is clean , malty aromas and a little bit of grain , but nothing much else . rather unanounced i 'd say ! t- i was actually quite impressed in this category ! lots of flavor that included sweet malts , wheaty notes , and a bit of citrus and moderate hops in the finish . much more rounded than i was anticipating ! m- richer than a lot of other lagers and a great smoothness best describe this one . low carbonation make this more enjoyable as well . d- while this is very flavorful and tastes much better than it smells , i could n't drink probably more than 2 bottles before moving onto something else , but definately this is a beer that i would recommend for somebody to try out if they want something a little different !"

S"this red-copper ale was from one of the less interesting casks that i sampled at nerax . it had a mild hop aroma and a mild , but hop dominated flavor . i did n't taste much peat or caramel . the beer tasted more like a pale ale than a scotch . a generic hop flavor was omnipresent . this light bodied ale had a smooth finish . it was drinkable , but not really on style ."

S"a - very light color . if you pour it fast into the glass ( if you bother ) you might get a finger of head . s - not a lot of aroma-a little bit of crispness . t - primary flavor is seltzer water . second flavor is a crisp , subtle hops , and last a little bit of sweet-but not from malt-maybe corn ? m - seltzer water . d - it 's all about timing . if you are looking for something with intense , complex flavor , or to go with spicy food , forget it . if you are looking for a beer after mowing the lawn on hot summer 's day , there 's nothing better . why ? bubbles . clean , no aftertaste . just enough alcohol to get in your pores and cool them down . $ 9 a 12/pk . drink it and enjoy ."

S"sold in a four-pack for $ 8.99 . pours and looks like a white beer ( hoeggarden ) with a orange hue . smells like a freshly peeled tangerine . taste is fantastic . it actually does taste like `` wet hops '' . light citrusy flavor is simple with hop bitterness . i could drink 12 of these . the taste does not give away its 7 % abv tastes like it would be 5 % at most . a great refreshing pale ale for those that do not want a bitter hop bomb ."

S"a : clear poor into a snifter , generates ample , white , head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing . the beer is a dark red/amber color s : i love the smell of this . dark fruits , raisons , cherries . the alcohol is faint , but you can smell it . i can also smell something else , it reminds me of like ... sprite , citrisy . t : i got a real big punch of citrus-sweetness right up front . the first drink finish with a nice hoppy bitterness mixed in with the dark fruits that i smelled . this beer is malty and well balanced . also , sequence tastes of the beer did n't produce that puch of citrus that i got with my first sip . finally , i should mention that the alcohol is noticeable if you are looking for it , but i blend in well with the other flavors . it does however give a nice warming sensation as you drink the beer , which probably good since it is a winter ale . m : not as much carbination as some belgian styles i have had . the beer is pretty thin , but is able to coat the mouth well and stick around until you next drink . d : i am trying something new here and not checking the abv on the beer before i determine this . so , given that i have no knowledge of the abv i thnk i will say that this is a pretty drinkable beer . not as good as the tremens , but still pretty good . give me 2 pints of this stuff and it will certainly turn into a happy hour . this beer is a favorite of mine and i was happy to be able to obtain a bottle of it to drink this year . i like the darker malt and fruit tastes that i get with the beer and also the characteristic acidity that most belgians have . good buy , go try ."

S"i found this beer at boise co-op down in the northend on eighth street sitting on the endcap of the beer sectioin with the other individual larger bottles . it came 750ml champagne style bottle , corked & caged wrapped in gold foil label inside a large box . i thought it was just an extra large bottle of beer which sold for about $ 13 . i was intrigued with the box and the write up on the beer bud yet never heard of it before . i snagged the bottle and brought it home when . i open the box i was quite surprised to find a glass inside as well . the glass is classic gobbler shape from the belgian style glass that you would expect to come from a belgium brewery . i thought at first it would have a large head but it had almost no header . i 'll would say maybe one & 1/2 cm head . it is white head . the beer looked brown-color rolling into a copper color at the bottom of the glass . i poured it directly from the bottle into the petrue glass which came in the box . smells orangey and pruney . my first impression was very sweet and smelled very nice . i enjoyed the smell . my first taste i thought was crazy , i 've have never taste anything quite like this before . very sweet . lots of carbon . really citrus labor on the back of your throught . i enjoyed the first taste but i 'm not sure of it . i can taste the raisin or prune flavor in there . it 's actually burns my nostril on the after taste . in the end i could n't handle to much of this beer . i gave it a low drinkablity with a high flavor . something about it twisted up my stomach within seconds of my first drink . i would really enjoy using this beer to cook with along with pairing it with some different meats . all in all i would n't buy this beer again ."

S"i 've been wanting to try this brew for quite some time now and as luck would have it , there was some at my doorstep today when i came home . this beer really is quite sexy . pours just like it 's name , like oil , thick and black like it was bubbling up outa the ground . a half inch dark tan head peaked and then subsided to a thin film that laced down my snifter in pockets . smells of chocolate , heavy roasted malts , oak , whiskey , and sweet candy came trough in droves , just smells great . taste is just full of sweet and doughy malts and bittersweet chocolate that transitions to a lingering oaky sweet finish that warms the tongue all the way down to the gut and everything in between . some alky burning is present but mellows as the beer warms . after only five or so sips feel this one coming on but it goes down so silky smooth that there 's no point in rushing it . like i said , i 've been waiting on this one and i was n't disappointed , truely one of the best in the style that i 've had to date ."

S"chilled bottle , 2009 vintage , into a glass . shared at a tasting . received in a generous trade from keefd . thanks , keith ! i was a little concerned about this beer being awful , since largadeer compared it to dark lord , which i ca n't stand . i expected a drainpour . a : pours a perfectly pitch black in the glass , letting no light through , even at the edges . the bottle is well-chilled , and a vigorous pour yields no head , but as it warms , swirling and agitation produce a nice , frothy mocha-colored head that rises to a finger in thickness . sadly , it falls quickly into a light collar and a swirl of bubbles on the brew . no lacing . s : barry ( bring ) made a comment that this smells like stir-fry and sesame oil , and as the beer warmed , i saw great hints of that . it also had a strong burnt ( not roasted , but burnt ) malt flavor that imparted elements of smoke and a light ashiness . chocolate was also quite strong . there were no hops in the nose . t : the beer goes through oscillations as it warms . when cold , it is mostly charred and smoky . at a little higher temperature , it is burnt and acrid , with a little citrus in the finish . slightly higher , and it develops a soy sauce / stir fry profile . as it approaches room temperature , the flavors meld into a nicer combination . yes , there 's a soy sauce / sesame oil flavor to it . yes , there 's still an acrid / burnt ash flavor in there . it 's also strongly sweet , with chocolate , molasses , and a dark fruit variety ( currants ? maybe figs ) . there is an underlying hop bitterness throughout , and it 's more apparent in the finish where it manifests as a citrus burst and some earth . at room temperature , these seemingly clashing flavors merge into a pretty enjoyable profile . it 's not the best imperial stout i 've had , but it 's quite well crafted . i have to say , though : no one in the room understood why people kept saying this beer is very hoppy ; this bottle was not . m : full body with a velvety feel from its low carbonation . it 's slightly warming , but there is no real booze to it . d : as i said above , it 's not the best imperial stout i 've had , but i think it 's solid . i expected it to be awful , and it turned out to exceed my expectations . i seemed to be the only one at the tasting who enjoyed it even this much , which surprised"

S"big thanks to sirdrinknp for yet another nw stunner . pours a cloudy dark amber , beautiful three finger beige head , leaves some spatula-worthy froth as it slowly subsides to a lasting half inch cap . nice . smell is strong , full of strange hop vegetal dankness , grapefruit pith , lemon , neutral sweet , a bit of tart yeast , and some nice floral notes keeping it together . i realize this aroma ai n't everyone 's cuppa tea , but as a confirmed hophead this is heaven , man . taste is a full flavored blast of vegetal , light bready sweet , floral , and then it steamrolls into some heavy citrus bitter , sweet lemon , and joins some resiny pine to mug the palate with a dry finish . this is fuller flavored than many beers purporting to be iipa , label says ipa , who am i to argue ? while the dry finish is n't on the order of the liberator , or hopsickle , or gubna for that matter , it is exceptionally clean and dry for the style . mouthfeel is good , low carb. , very resinous , nice finish , stays clean in mouth between sips . maybe a bit too viscous for style . drinkability , rated for style , is not so good . i 'd love a couple of these , but i often crave four or five of others in this style . impression : yet another beer requiring cross-country travel to re-visit . complex and interesting offering . recommended ."

S"does n't take much of an aggressive pour to get the head over three fingers , kind of eggshell white color of mainly foam with some slghtly larger bubbles , simmers down with ease , leaves nice big sheets of lacing stuck to the glass sides . very light haze to the orange rust color , red clay tint , minor hue loss around the rims . has a kind of `` first fruit pie of the harvest '' feel , peaches , pears and apples , brown sugar , taffy sort of sweetness , croissant or other flaky dough matter , no real hoppy scents , any sweet baking spices play a minor role . full-bodied , close to heavy , particularly when factoring for the beer style . density might actually hamper the sweetness some , caramel , rum raisin ice cream , butterscotch , banana compote yet not `` sugary '' in a meaningful way . apricot , yellow apple , peach , pear fruit again take on a fruit salad character but not canned fruit cocktail . the cocoa , mocha has a drying influence . yeasty and doughy in a heavy , dense manner . floral water , clingy without any refreshing aspect at the end . if you just close your eyes and drink it as `` beer '' than it can be interesting but , that said , all you need is half a pint to get it as much as is possible ."

S'a - cloudy using a the swirl and pour technique . straw yellow tints of orange . minimal head but solid lacing . a little pale and dull . s- slightly grainy aroma at first gives way to some very interesting esters fruity and floral . t- very tart and almost bitter at first . fades to banana and clove flavors . not too interesting . m/d- a little light and thin in the mouth . the first bottle i had was totally hammered by a spicy thai meal so i had to try another a few days later . the lightness does make it very refreshing and drinkable .'

S"pours a pretty black with a frothy espresso-crema head with a little bit of lacing . on the nose there is a big coffee note with an undertone of boozy goodness . there is some roast bitterness coming in from the periphery , too . on the tongue the coffee mingles with some sweeter notes , with the bitterness developing later with the warming booze which provides for a huge finish . in the mouth it 's a somewhat thinner body than i 'm used to for the style , perhaps medium rather than medium full , but satisfying enough . the booze note holds back the drinkability but i 'm willing to sacrifice that for flavor in a big stout . a very good beer ."

S"maybe i just do n't like milk stouts ... i was excited to try this while down in st. lucia as i was sick to death of piton but was disappointed . sweetness utterly dominates this beer . looks great , dark brown to black and clear with a dark tan/almost brown head . nose was of chocolate , coffee , and sweet raisiny fruit . taste was all cloying sweetness along with the above flavors . i expected there to be some roastiness to balance but it was minimal and not enough . of course , and unfortunately , absolutely zero hop bitterness . carbonation was nice but overall slick , milky , and sticky all at once in mouthfeel . this may be better used as a reduction in cooking desserts ."

S"i can hardly wait to try this beer as part of the canquest ( tm ) , thanks to its causing me to get smarter about an old beer term that was new to me . can you dig it ? from the can : `` in your neighborhood since 1902 . `` ; `` old style is returning to the time-honored german tradition of kraeusening first used by g. heilman in 1902 when he created old style beer . `` ; `` think local , drink local . `` ; `` authentically kraeusened . '' greg koch can pooh-pooh `` fizzy yellow beers '' all he wants , but there is something aesthetically pleasing about them to my vision . following the crack & glug , i had two finger 's worth of foamy bone-white head to keep me company . the beer itself was a light golden-yellow with ne-quality clarity . the nose was faintly lager-sweet underlain with a mild amount of cereal . pretty typical , if you ask me . mouthfeel was medium with a light bitterness on the tongue along with some cereal flavors . finish was slightly dry , mostly unobtrusive , sort of bland overall . i am not a proponent of the style , old or not . it just does not have enough ooomph for me and leaves me wanting the regular version of the beer . i am really glad to have been able to get some in a trade because a 30-cube would have left me with buyers ' remorse . a definite once-and-done ."

S"from 22oz bomber . another smuttynose big beer for the record books . a- very nice , creamed coffee head , a healthy pour gives me a frothy , 3-fingered head that settles nicely . black-as-midnight body . s- slightly peppery , boozy , and very caramel-riffic . a unique porter profile , not something i 've smelled before . t- the caramel was borderline overpowering in the nose , but nowhere to be found in the taste ( a good thing ! ! ) . this beer is fruity , moreso than most baltic porters . i taste dates , raisins , plums , and perhaps some berry fruit as well . there 's a rich , tannin-centric malt that draws slowly across the tongue . hints of tobacco , leather , and an earthy quality help round out the robust flavor profile . sweet , but in check , this is a tasty porter . has some similar flavors to a few old ales i 've had ... the 2007 old stock i recently had is ringing in my head as i drink this . m- thick , chewy , and very well-constructed . enough elements to keep you interested , a healthy carbonation , and a complexity not usually found in porters help this one score highly . very fruity for a porter , something different , and something welcome as well . d- moderate . the bomber went down with no problem . another tasty treat from smuttynose ... which is quickly surpassing dfh as my favorite east coast brewery . seriously , as a nh native at heart , i am thrilled to be within the distro . of smuttynose . truly a spectacular beer and another notch on the well-worn belt of smuttynose !"

S'january 2009 bottle poured from a bomber into my snifter . been sitting on this one since early last year . beer pours a yellowish orange with a pure white head . the head lingers the carbonation on this beer is perfect . great lacing all over the glass . faint aromas of brett , horse hair . though green grapes ? or sour apples is more prominent . there is also a faint hop aroma coming through and some leather as well . very nice aroma , a favorite of mine . the flavor follows from the aroma , sour apple , crisp and slightly bitter up front . there are some brett flavors in there but they are not predominant . this beer has an incredibly clean finish . wonderful mouth feel that enhances the drinkability of this beer . again i really think allagash nailed the carbonation on this one . this beer truly fills your mouth , if that make sense . edit : had another of 2009 january batch . wow , after 1.5 years insane brett development changes the whole beer . horse hair , hey , brett funk and pinapples . cheers'

S"an attractive dark chocolaty red hue fills my lucky dog st. patrick 's day pint glass as i decant this `` scottish style ale '' . i 'm looking at one to two fingers of bubbly eggshell tinted head . the bouquet is very malty with alcohol undertones . a medium to light mouthfeel delivers full malty flavors along with delicate chocolate syrup and notes of oak . the 9 % abv is moderately noticeable in the finish with a nice warming quality as the beer is swallowed . this beer is very smooth and easy to drink . it sits quite lightly compared to other scotch ales that i have enjoyed . this would make a very nice session beer but for the high alcohol content . i ca n't pick out much in the way of hops in this beer ; the flavor is much more on the malt side . but it 's not too heavy or sweet . overall a very satisfying experience . or in my two-year-old daughter 's words : `` i wike dis one !

S"appearance : samuel adams honey porter pours a dark maroon-to-ruby colour along with a high ( ca 2,5 inches ) , light brown-to-orange crown and which diminishes rather slowly and eventually leaves plenty of decrepit letters-looking lacing . smell : at first there is a sweetness reminiscent to that of plums and raisins and then there is some dark bread in the background . taste : the first thing that strikes me is that for a so-called `` honey porter '' is that it is n't all that sweet ... nonetheless , samuel adams honey porter is not a bad beer , far from it ! sure , it has some mild , honey-like characteristics in the beginning but they are almost directly dominated by a acrid sensation which is clearly evident in throughout the entirety of the taste . mouthfeel : medium in carbonation . body : full . round . smooth . great ! drinkability : surely interesting , however it 's ultimately not all that convincing as a `` honey porter '' ... but as a porter ? sure ! give it a go ya ho !"

S"had this on tap at bodega . review from notes . hop bomb extraordinaire ! great label , probably my favorite sn label art to date . the beer arrived a darker shade of brass , not very brilliant , though it was late enough in the evening that the bar lighting was fairly dim . clear , with a short off-white head , ok lace tendrils were creeping down the glass . the smell was mostly citrus - lots and lots of very bitter grapefruit and orange rind . the alcohol is definitely in the nose - it was biting but also very sweet . the taste begins very malty and very boozy . the alcohol is entirely unwelcome for me in this beer . there was no need for it to clock in at over 10 % abv . the hop character is as in your face as any dipa ought to ever be . 100 ibu 's ? yeah , i believe it . the hop character is essentially all pine in the flavor - super resinous to the point of being enamel-peeling . way too much if you ask me . i want a little balance in my beer . i want a lot of balance if i am to drink more than one in a sitting . frankly i did n't want to finish this one glass . the mouthfeel is slick and bitter , long into the finish . much too boozy - this is not something i would want to drink again ."

S'appearance : pours a hazy pale golden color with a decent though not spectacular cap ; leaves a smattering of lace , however smell : cracked wheat , banana bread and a hint of lemon taste : opens with a cracked wheat and banana flavor , with just a hint of lemony sourness that arrives by mid-palate ; past is prologue and the finish is much the same as the opening mouthfeel : medium body with moderate carbonation drinkability : not knowing enough about the austrian style , i would describe this as an entry hefe - not as rich in flavor or carbonation as its german cousins , and rather devoid of any clove aspect ; still , this is easy to drink and very enjoyable'

S"looked great in the snifter with lots of carbonation clinging to the sides and a thick tan head , though this faded fast , as expected . aroma was of sweet caramel , chocolate and molasses , with the characteristic roast and coffee smells as well . at first taste , earthy flavors in the front of the mouth gave way quickly to malty chocolate , followed by strong alcoholic warmth and a bit of herbal hop finish . i found that the malt intensity could be slightly overwhelming and out of balance ( how else did they get a 10.8 ? ) if i were stone i would knock down the gravity just a bit to even things out . my drinkability rating was particularly low as i 'm not inspired to knock this one back due to the combined alcoholic slap in the face and the overwhelming maltiness . still , this is a very respectable and tasty beer in the style ."

S"i tried this beer for the first time last week . during a slow period in the kitchen , i picked up michael jackson 's beer companion . i did n't know too much about lambics aside from their usually fruity flavorings . we opened a bottle that had been aging in the basement for awhile . when we first opened the bottle i did n't know what to expect . i 'm a big fan of pungent and cellar aged cheeses . the smell of the beer was a very earthy , barnyardy type smell . i might say i liked smelling the beer almost as much as drinking it . the mouthfeel of the beer was just a little tingly , with a very sour taste . as odd as it may sound the taste reminded me of the warheads candy . it was intensley sour , that almost made it too sour to drink . all in all i loved it , although it is a bit pricey ."

S'2008 version 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter . pours a deep caramel color with garnet highlights and a sizable light tan head that remains for a few minutes . moderate lacings . aroma is hoppy , with an alcoholic presence and an underlying fruity base . not too much on the malt side , except some caramel that is overpowered by the aromatic hops . taste is sweet up front , with craramel malts and fruit notes of grape and a hint of apple , alongside a coniferous character from the hops which commands the back of the palate and contributes to a dry and bitter finish . mouthfeel is medium to full bodied , with an alcoholic bite and a dry finish . drinkability is decent . in short , this brew has a lot of everything , and lacks a key focus to derive a specific character from the brew . all over the place with no where to call home . that being said , there is a complexity and a boldness here that is seldom achieved in an american barleywine .'

S"a- pours a thick , ominous motor oil black . nothing passes through when held up to the light . the only problem is that there is no head . none . it is a headless , dark , ominous , and very scary looking beer . s- the astringency from the alcohol strong enough to burn nose hairs . once you get past this , deep black chocolate malt can be detected . t- upfront , at first this tastes a lot like old heathen . dark chocolate roasted malt upfront ris like characteristics all over the place . upon further examination there is a big , smooth yeasty backbone and hints of cherries pop up too . the yeast is more noticeable for the finish where it becomes a bit sour ( interesting really ) ... but the highlight of this finish is a big alcohol astringency and bitterness . this booziness overpowers everything else and lingers for quite awhile and the alcohol warmth is high . great initial flavor but way too boozy at the end . m- body is thick and smooth and with low carbonation . syrupy like a stout , but smooth and yeasty like a belgian , and do n't forget the alcohol . d- maybe i 'm too much of a girl for this one but it was way too boozy to be drinkable . i was able to finish my 12 oz . bottle but i felt like i was downing shots with every sip . everything else about this brew is great though . maybe aging will tame it ."

S"a - pours a very light copper . a little cloudy which is to expected with a hop monster like this . there was a bit of a white head but it quickly went down to lace ring . s - huge hop smell . spicy lemons and other citrus fruits . some flower like notes also . t - christ almighty its hop candy . the sweetness slaps you in the face . there is still plenty of hop character there . piney hop presence but mostly the sweetness overwhelms . not horrible but if i did not know better i would think its some super sweet malt liqour or something . with everything else going on i do n't really get much bitterness out of it . strange . m - the mouthfeel is pretty silky . leaves mouth puckering piney resin on your tongue after every sip . d - like i said not horrible but it will be a chore to even get through this 12 oz bottle . if you do buy one leave it in a closet for like years . it might mature into something else . then again maybe not . a unique brew for sure but do n't know if i will ever get another one . 90 minute and 60 minutes are pretty good drinkable ipas . this is something else entirely . enter at your own risk ."

S"appearance : poured well with a nice full head . lacings plentiful and long lasting . color is a medium caramel color . impressive . smell : light hops with citrus overtures . very pleasant . not overbearing . the aroma is delicate . taste : malt creaminess is the first impression on the tongue . hopping is light with probable aromatic hops . faint sweetness is appealing and not overdone . the taste curve is well defined and smooth . enjoyable . this does n't strike me as a pilsner . mouthfeel : malty sweetness is first impression . a little strong at first but rapidly disipates into a smooth glow . pleasant and acceptable for new drinkers . drinkibility : i found the creamy sweetness as very drinkable and not heavy like a wheat beer . this is not a pilsner ... lager maybe , but not a pilsner . due to this corporate misnaming , if one expects a pilsner , one will be disappointed . prosit ! nikki"

S'this is a pleasant and drinkable english session beer . pours a light amber color with a thin white head . the aroma has a nice hop and malt balance , leaning a little toward the malt . the taste is a good balance of sweet maltiness and bitter hops but nothing outstanding . mouthfeel is quite thin , almost watery . definitely a drinkable session beer but nothing special .'

S"the bottle reviewed was bottled in 1999 . the head is not particularly attractive for this kind of beer , with an orange colour . the smell is horse sweat , aged leather ( ! ) . it 's a flat lambic , quite quiet , with maybe a little lack of aggressiveness and naughtiness ... it is advisable as an introduction to lambic ."

S"source/serving : 12oz . bottle smell : artificial brown sugar , strong medicinal/herbal note which does n't really match with the assertive coriander spiciness . this is a bit of a train wreck with strong roastiness and a dark dankness - like an old cellar . taste : thin and artificial . nondescript maltiness up front that quite bland and flavorless but not super sweet . in the middle the carbonation becomes more prevalent and there is a lifeless ripe fruit flavor with a banana edge and faint spices . finish is short , semisweet , and spicy ."

S"poured from 22oz bomber into a pint glass . appearance : rich , hazy medium orange hue with lots of apparent effervescence . head poured three thick fingers of pillowy ivory foam . pretty good in my book . smell : sweet malt aroma with a nicely complex hop profile . i get floral notes , some funk , and a strong , bitey citrus and pine aroma that is almost over the top . it 's a bit extreme , but i can appreciate its merits . actually , as i slowly drink through this beer , the aroma is really starting to grate on me in a bad way . not good . taste : whoa . the floral notes and strong , bitey , piney citrus that were so nice in the aroma turn into a tart , haranguing sour citrus flavor with some soapy notes . man , i was going to say `` it 's not that bad '' , but after a few more sips i do n't think i can . i feel like the brewer was trying to go into a new and exciting direction but ended up pointed the wrong way . this is just a craft beer gone pretty badly wrong . mouthfeel : medium , medium-light body with an ok level of carbonation . feel is good , despite the crazy flavor . drinkability : this flavor is just an absolute mess . hoppy , certainly , but it 's much crazier than any other ipa i 've ever had . bizarre flavors and extreme imbalance make this beer less-than-drinkable . not bad enough for a drainpour , but uff da . get it together , hood canal ! the more of this i drink , the nastier it gets . i 'm not certain i 've ever poured most of a bomber down the drain , but i think dabob bay ipa will get this distinction . just plain too nasty to finish . sorry , guys ."

S'single - best by july of 2011 - poured into a dfh snifter this beer poured yellow amber , like the color of honey . not the color i usually look for in an ipa but i guess that is a result of lack of crystal malts.. ? great head with good lacing . smells amazingly good , not so much the grapefruit or pine , but this beer is all lemon zest for me . it was a pleasure to stick my nose in . tasted great as well , very light in body while still smooth . this beer was incredibly drinkable yet i found the mouthfeel to suffer slightly with a grassy after bite . overall - great ipa - i would buy it again'

S"thick opaque brown with very nice dark tan head ( tiny bubbles ) . had does n't linger long , and no appearent lacing . smells of deep caramel malts with strong alcohol esters . very sweet , roasted malts taste with deep warming alcohol character . too much alcohol if you ask me , but upon reflection the the intensity of the maltiness may warrent the alcohol . not sure of the freshness of the bottle . i may have to trek to the brewery to find out . extremely full bodied with creamy mouthfeels . the intensity does not make it very drinkable . notes : i enjoy this one about 8 oz at a time . by the end of the 12 oz bottle i 'm disliking it . i 'm thinking it 's the alcohol , perhaps the combo of strong sweet and smokiness along with alcohol that turns me off after a while . this is intense as i 've had of any beer ."

S"jet black , very little head and i poured vigorously . this is probably the strangest smelling impy stout i 've ever had . i get cinnamon , coffee , roasted malt , maybe some potpourri , gingerbread , nutmeg , who the hell knows what . its spice all up in the nose with roasted malt . i got to be honest , that scares me as i like 2 `` spices '' in my beer , malt and hops . diving in , i get a big punch of lightly carbed impy stout roasted malt , then a light finish of these gingerbread holiday spices . as it warms , its evolving into a much better beer , i 'm going to let the next one sit out a while longer . 11 % abv . not sessionable , but i 'm having another , its really growing on me . its certainly not something i want everyday but i have 3 feet of snow on the ground outside and if my xmas tree was still up this would be so welcomed . again , i ca n't stand spiced beers but this one is pretty damn good . a spiced impy stout , i can dig it . very warming , like a bourbon warming . not hot on the taste but a little alcohol heat on the finish . i think thats fine for a big holiday sort of stout ."

S"american brown ales , oh how you can be so different from your brothers , the english ! poured into a tulip . bod unknown/did n't look . whoops . smells include espresso and a general malty-ness . not overpowering but definitely there . decent head for the style , beige colored . not too bad , some concentric lacing as it settles . body itself is dark brown with some cloudy red hue as light passes through . not opaque but not as light as most brown ales . cloudy . taste includes the initial mocha/espresso from the malt and a tad bit of bitterness from the hops . a very feint sourness in the finish accompanied by some metallic notes though not nearly noticeable enough to detract from the beers excellent overall taste . very reminiscent of a single estate dark chocolate bar - bold in its flavors and confident in what it is . mouthfeel is medium to full . silky and lowish in carbonation . it suits the flavor profile very well . drinkability is decent for such a beer though i 'm not sure i 'd be able to throwback more than a few ( even if i wanted , which i would ) . it is n't that the taste becomes unwelcome but rather it is much too filling to make it a long session beer . overall , a fine first taste from a local microbrewery . i can be both a hops head and otherwise . this beer definitely has a noticable bitter hops taste to it that would appeal to a hops head but not nearly so much as to offend a seasoned craft beer drinker that is n't ."

S"possibly the palest ale i have ever seen . exceptionally clear . pale straw colour . pure white head dissapears rather quickly . looks like a pale lager . smells of grassy hops and a little bit of cooked veggies , dms i guess . smell is very weak . tastes of sweet malts and a rather pleasant ( imo ) strain of hops . leaves the mouth with a sharpness upon the tongue . mouthfeel is nice ; carbonation is n't too extreme . not too watery . very drinkable . i have before , and may wella gain slug these back ad infinitum . however , i must admit , i do n't know why . i obviously do n't have much to say about this beer ; there 's nothing special about it . it does n't even look like an ale , or smell much like one , and lacks the major hoppiness that i normally associate with ipas . not a bad beer . not a really good one either . pretty respectable for a macrobrew though ."

'' it definitely gives the beer a unique personality . there is also a creamy caramel quality that builds as the beer warms . it falters a bit on the palate , which is not as full as the nose promises . the finish is long and lingers on the roasty/chocolate qualities , and some sour cherries come out at the very end . it is more a quaffer than a sipper , but it has its merits and is a nice beer overall ."

S"appears a bright golden copper slight hazed hue with a light white head forming thick atop the glowing orange body . lacing is fine and even down the sides of my chalice . aroma has a solid vegetable affair going on with green onion and fresh resinous citric hops , a semi sweet lightly toasted cracker malt profile not much sweetness going on . flavor is more of the same with the green onion flavor hitting pretty hard on the palate . a resinous semi sugary sweetness wrapped with green onion and a mild garlic flavor hit hard . i ca n't see drinking this one in number , that vegetable hop freshness found here is much different than other fresh hopped ales out on the market . mouthfeel is oily with hop resins a bit hot with a mild alcohol burn , this beer really is n't really my idea of fresh hopped ale . a sweet sugar malt base with that green onion tone throws the party off carbonation was mild and smooth , but overall the finish from the onion stays on your breathe . drinkability overall is pretty weak , not worth the 5.99 i paid for at fathead 's this past weekend but i 've been wanting to try it . i do n't think i could drink a four pack of this stuff . update for 2011 exponentially better than the last batch ... this beer was drank at the sharp edge for around 7 bucks a bottle and suprisingly totally worth every penny . pours a super pale golden hazed color with a bright white head forming thick , i was shocked at how light this beer poured . the nose was full of pungent fresh wet hops esepcially citrus/herbal/grassy tones , of course there is a light pale biscuit malt feature addeded in the nose as well . pretty damn good bitterness balanced with enough pale biscuit malts just to take the edge of it , but as a whole it 's a dank super hoppy harvest ale from our friends at founders ... damn i 'm going to get some 12.99 4 packs at giant eagle this coming week a damn tasty fine beer that should be drank in number meant to be enjoyed with friends . i was buying this for a friend not familiar with the hops and he kept calling it the `` weed '' beer , by the way he was loving it . mouthfeel was bitter dry clean finish , with ample carbonation and the drinkability factor was inasane for something so hoppy . i could have drank this one all night as my only harvest ale at the sharp edge where two different founders beers were flowing on tap . i had two pints of founders centennial but i really liked the harvest ale ."

S"poured into a laughing dog beer glass , when i held this brew up to the light it was a dark blood red . in regular lighting- a rich dark brown that you ca n't see through- what 's in there ? something dangerous perhaps ... the smell sums this beer up for me- it 's got things going on ( chocolate , barley , a little bitter ) , but it dies off a little short . same with the taste- ends up slightly on the watery side despite keeping it real most of the way . this also brings down the points for mouthfeel , it 's a little on the thin side for me . however , you ca n't forget that it 's an ale , so despite the fact that it leans towards stout ( oh yeah ) , it 's up front about the ale factor , which explains the wateryness . all in all , a super solid brew , especially for the price , and one that i could see myself drinking quite a few of in one night . will buy again ."

S'this beer comes in a bright clear blue profile bottle . have i seen a blue beer bottle before ? dont think so the colour is pale yellow , the liquid is very cloudy . the two finger white firm head sinks very slowly leaving some massive lacing . the smell is very fruity with sweet notes of bananas , apricot jam , gooseberries , lemonade , fruit drops . there are some sour notes too . the taste is sweet-sourish with lots of lemonade-like flavours . citric flavours are mixed with herbs , sour wheat , some yeast , and fruit candy . the aftertaste is refreshingly sour with notes of sweets , lime coordinal , green apples and passion fruits . the carbonation is very strong ; the small bubbles creates a foamy mouthfeel . a very lemonade-like beer with lots of artificial flavours . probably a perfect thirst drencher on a hot summer afternoon .'

S"exciting new beer - an interesting adaptation on black ipas . pours brown/red not black like many dark ipa s currently being brewed . smell is delicious ... just what the style should smell like , huge cascade grapefruit , and strawberry piney notes from centenial/simcoes maybe ? this mixes with a pleasant woody , malty body ... smells really delicious . taste is very nice as well ... sweet , but not overly so , nice , caramelly , roasty tasting malts , with a very strong hop backbone ... finishes smooth and warm . this gets a 5 for drinkability without a doubt . considering the fact that this is basically a 9 % ipa , i 'm not sure i 've had anything more drinkable ... its smooth , totally balanced , warm but not boozy ... just really nice to drink ! somehow the strong malt character totally mellows the hops and vice versa - as borat would say ... great success !"

S"a sexy , sexy beer . an exotic and impenetrably opaque obsidian . aggresive pour rewards a fading finger of firm foam with only moderate lacing . what aroma there is smells mostly of very toasted malt . a hint of something sweet , hiding in there as well . no hops to speak of . it is quite bitter , almost solely from the dark malt . i do detect some minor hopping , a touch more would n't go astray . a pleasant sweetness is evident in the middle , quickly followed by more coffee bean espresso . as my girlfiend pointed out , some miso soup in the mix as well . the alcohol is a touch prickly . there 's not a lot really going on . a dark chocolate coated arabica bean . body is robust enough with good carbonation encouraged by a good sloosh between the teeth . one was fun ."

S"the drinkability on this baby is exceptional indeed , i enjoyed two without remorse before putting up this review ( last night ... not this morning , but now that i think about it what a perfect breakfast beer when coffee stouts aint your thang ) poured into a run of the mill pint glass with an overall crisp , clearp , light amber coloring and not too impressive of a head . the aroma of this is top notch , it is bursting with fresh from the orchard apples and i almost think i could be about to drink some mott 's . the taste ... i expected it to be as apple juice sweet as its nose implicated but this is not entirely the case . yes , it is on the sweet side , but there is a smooth malty backbone to it that wo n't let you forget too long that it is indeed a beer you are enjoying . it is mildly spiced with hints of cinnamon , but overall just tastes like an apple malt beverage . regardless , for a fruit beer , top notch . i would love to have easy access to this for hot summer mornings : - )"

S"my first 420 experience on-tap , along with sw ipa on-tap a : pours a transparent pale copper color with a big fluffy/soapy head . retention is surprisingly excellent . s : the nose is really subtle and light , but if you dig a little bit it 's there , and pretty nice . floral hops greet you at first , then transitions into a malty/bready/biscuity dominant aspect . light citrus from the hops , as well as some underlying sweetness and honey . alcohol is faintly noticeable . t : wow , much better than the nose , and different from the bottled version as i remember . the hops give some delicate floral notes , a sturdy bitterness , and slight pineapple , grapefruit , peach , and orange . lots of honey in the end palate , and the way that it adds to the sweetness , and at the same time , balances the bitterness is awesome . mf/d : carbonation is pretty much what one would expect it to be ; a little bit fizzly , but smooth enough . lingering honey finish on it , and the alcohol is slightly noticeable . this is a dry finish . very drinkable , especially at $ 6 a pitcher ... notes : i slightly prefer this on-tap , but otherwise pretty even . i personally think that this beer deserves better numbers ."

S'now this is one odd duck . presented in the pint + 6 650ml bottle with no freshness date . pours into the pint glass a clear reddish-orange with numerous bubbles beneath a solid 1-finger creamy tan head that fades at a moderate pace , leaving a small amount of lacing . head and lacing are gone by the bottom of the glass . nose is quite odd , sort of a mildly hoppy mesquite bbq potato chip . not bad ; just odd . taste follows logically from the nose ; theres a tart bbq flavor up front , very smoky and sharp , with a definite burn at the end like chili peppers . good taste , just , uh hot . mouth is somewhat on the thin side , semi-syrupy , smooth , with mild carbonation . drinkability is average to low ; i struggled through the bottle . probably would be more palatable paired with some mild mexican fare . overall : for my first chili beer , its not bad , but still not the thing id seek out on a regular . a good niche beer ; worth a try .'

S"had on tap at the local taphouse . seems it may have been randalled - presumably through some peppers - although i was n't told this when it was served . that 's another matter . pours a dark mahogany colour with murky brown around the edge . head is a nice ochre colour , nice and frothy but does n't retain very well . some lace , but not a lot . looks decent . smells rather sweet . good toasty underlying but largely cocoa producing chocolatey notes that take on a milky edge , with a touch of vanilla . brown sugar as well and maybe a slight capsicaian note at the back , but not a whole lot . more of an organic tickle than any real pepper notes . pleasant , but neither really cock-sockin ' nor ball-knockin ' . taste is not bad , plenty of nice stout notes on assault with mild cocoa and some espresso roast . midway gives way to that chipotle pepper character , which is quite hot , with a bitter capsicum flavour but more of a mild sizzling sensation . finish is chocolatey and has a chilli choc overall hit . quite a nice brew , does n't wow me as much as hunter brewing 's choc-chilli porter they did for gabs though . with that in mind , this beer is probably more drinkable , still impressive , but they could have upped the cock-sockin ' capabilities . thin , with chilli burn . could use more body to pad it up and restore the balance in the mouth . this is my first offering from moon dog , a brewery with as much hype behind it as brewdog and as many beers available to the mainstream as westvleteren . i 'm not unimpressed , but at the same time the brewery 's hype has preceeded the product . punk marketing like this can really backfire . in this case they delivered enough , but if they keep promising more i 'm going to keep expecting more ."

S"500ml bottle into duvel tulip . appearance : free pour yields a three inch , rocky offwhite head that dissipates slowly leaving thick lacing . pours a dark brown and leaves a few lines of short-lasting lacing . smell : some smoke and toast . subtle , mild smell . some bland maltiness underneath the smoke . taste : follows the nose . smooth bland lager then tons of campfire / wood burning stove smoke that 's savory and complex , lasting into a long , surprisingly dry finish . the smoke is bold but not palate wrecking or mouthcoating or anything ; for such a strong flavor , it 's quite delicate . while the non-smoke flavors unfortunately do n't get past bland , white-bread maltiness , the smoke develops quite a bit ; there 's charcoal , ash , burnt bacon , and more . the other aspects of the beer do n't `` fail to stand up to the smoke , '' but rather are just 1-dimensional to begin with . white bread and a hint of lager-y tartness . some bitterness would really set this beer off . mouthfeel : light side of medium bodied , but with some creaminess . unexpectedly ( and unwelcomely ) dry finish . too low carbonation . overall : nice flavor . while on its own there 's a lot of things that leave me a bit unsatisfied , the beer earns an extra point in `` overall '' for how well it pairs with food . if this were `` pairing-food-with-beer-advocate , '' this one would get an easy 5 . i generally do n't like to drink beer while i eat , but i had a hunch that this would pair well with a veggie burger ( w/ onions , mustard , ketchup , salt , pepper , tomatoes , garlic powder ) and vegetable soup ( lots of salt , herbs , freshly cracked black pepper ) . my hunch was right . if you 're looking for a beer to drink with burgers and/or aggressively seasoned soups , look no further . the delicate flavors in this beer do n't just stand up to salt and spices , they beautifully compliment them while themselves getting more intense . i ca n't think of a better beer for a barbecue . pairs amazingly ."

S"chaz sent this to me as part of an ongoing massive trade between the two of us and i am both grateful ( for a new can ) and hesitant ( it is a minhas beer ) . the canquest ( tm ) marches on ! from the can : `` 'welcome to the backyard with the sun high in the sky , the grass freshly cut , and the aroma of hot coals and steak as you relax in your lawn chair . this is your safeguard , the backyard . ' '' ; `` a midwest tradition of craft brewing '' . the crack & glug produced two fingers of rocky eggshell-white head with low retention . color was a murky , hazy orangish-yellow . i think that chaz hit it by characterizing it as an `` apwa '' , vice an `` apa '' because the nose held a remarkable absence of hops . it had more of a bubble gum sweetness on the nose and did i catch an underlying scent of plastics factory and dry cleaning solution , or was it just my imagination ? mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unpleasant in all new and different ways . it tasted like the summer that i contracted trenchmouth and had to gargle with diluted hydrogen peroxide and have my gums treated with gentian violet . i had nearly forgotten that long-dormant memory until this rubbish hit my palate . finish had a metallic twang that really made my hackles rise because the uninitiated might attribute it to the medium ( a can ) as opposed to the source ( minhas , makers of the world 's finest swill and worst beer ) . jeez-o , man , but if the canquest ( tm ) did not require full cansumption in order to count , this would be a drain pour . not my sink , but out front , in the gutter where it belongs and may have actually come from . if i am in the backyard , i do not want this beer anywhere near me , my lawn chair , my sizzling steak ( s ) and definitely not in my cooler . gag ."

S"while there 's always something wonderful to be said about monk 's cafe , i have to say that this beer was a little bit of a bummer . the beer looks beautiful . it pours a wonderfully bright reddish brown with a nice fluffy , pale khaki head . it smells sweet and wild and yeasty . a bit of fruityness can be detected here i 'd say , but nothing out of the ordinary . the taste starts out really sweet and tart . almost gummi bear-ish , obviously not as sweet as that , but a little too sweet in my mind for a flemmish sour . there 's a decent bit of sourness and a hint of wood that appears after that first blast of sweet and tart changes into a wild and funky aftertaste if you do n't go for another sip too soon . the mouthfeel is very refreshing with its scrubby , spritzy carbonation . i must say though , this is n't highly drinkable due to its level of sweetness . again , i was a little bummed ."

S"served from a 22 oz . bomber into a bruery tulip glass and enjoyed with the very lovely amy marie . a : poured a dark brown hue and thinner than what i had originally anticipated . after letting the beer settle for a few moments , i noticed the lack of head and lacing ... which was bit disappointing as well . s : a strong roasted coffee smell along with dark chocolate , caramel , and perhaps a touch of vanilla bean . t : a very nice combination of coffee and dark chocolate , neither one overtaking the basic flavor profile . the tail end of the beer has a hint of caramel , which is another positive touch . the only criticism i have is the apparent alcohol taste the java leaves me . m : barely reaches the full-body description i find in imperial stouts and a bit too fizzy at times . d : the thing i enjoyed the most about this beer was the subtle , but obvious coffee flavor . most of the coffee stouts i 've tried tend to be over-the-top and take away from the complexity of the beer . in java 's case , the balance of all the tastes and smell is represented remarkably . again , the only knock is the evident alcohol presence . overall : a good beer , not great . cheers !"

S"22oz bomber poured into a tulip . pours a very attractive hazy gold color with a foamy , white , one finger head . head retention is good ; calms slowly to a thin film with chunky lacing . smell is spicy with notes of clove and banana . pale malts come through with a grassy character . taste follows nose but gives you much more . apple and banana notes hit first followed by hop bitterness and finish off with a honey like malt sweetness that lingers . alcohol content is noticeable in the finish but does n't overpower other flavors . mouthfeel is pretty good . carbonation makes this one feel light and creamy and also gives the flavors a little kick . drinkability is really the only part that suffers here . black tulip is delicious no doubt , but it 's definitely a sipping beer . i think you 'd be hard pressed to have more than one or two of these , especially so if you have a bomber ."

S"poured from a 22oz bottle into my dogfish head shaped pint glass . beer was bottled on 5/11/09 ( just over 3 weeks ago ) . liquid is somewhere between auburn and bole , and glows a ruby-tinged burnt umber against the light . a substantive but short lived beige head leaves a very thin ring of foam just barely sustained by carbonation . clarity is excellent . the aroma is lightly roasted coffee , a slight sourness ( perhaps from yeast ) , and a strong savory whiff of dimethyl sulfide . it tastes of weak or stale coffee , unripe apples , light malt , and chocolate . fairly sweet overall . faintly nutty . maybe a slight touch of diacetyl ( butter/cream ) . a bit like a poorly mixed black & tan made with a decent porter rather than a stout . unfortunately , the vegetal flavors become overwhelming ... the `` creamed corn '' aspect interfers with everything else . crisp , fairly light-bodied but very smooth , almost slick really . carbonation is decent but disguised . a dark american lager that does well with appearance and ok with mouthfeel , and has some good flavors , but is pretty much ruined by dms . i 'm having difficulty finishing my glass ..."

S"a - poured out a clear , straw yellow color with a thin , fizzy , white head . it did not last long nor leave any lace . s - it smelled of corn and grains . not much else . t - taste was not bitter . like the aroma , it tasted mostly of corn , grains and adjuncts . no hop flavor present . m - it was crisp and fizzy . light bodied and a little watery . d - this is what it is , a light lager . not something i 'd take to a friends house , but it was great to drink while doing yard work on a hot spring day ."

S"ahhh , southern tier , no one does it quite like you ; you are the very definition of a double-edged sword . the 'trouble brewing ' comic entitled 'choklat ' basically says it all . i digress , on to the beer at hand ... creme brulee pours a deep brown hue , and is obviously borderline syrupy , although it does sport a persistent cappuccino-like head . the smell and taste of this beer is fantastically decadent , in-league with the richest deserts conceivable . basically , its flavor is similar to its namesake , or to , say , a werther 's caramel-flavored monin syrup , except a stout version of the aforementioned , and it is about as syrupy-viscous as conceivable . this is , however , beer we are talking about here , and so the hugely confectionery element that this brew brings to the plate requires an adjustment of parameters to enjoy . i could not drink very much of this , but i can not deny that it tastes good ."

S'this has been labeled as a new england favorite . i cant believe ive waited this long to try this beer . i poured a cloudy copper color ( i like my ipas with a little cloud ) . nice off-white , thick head with a delicate lace on the pour . wonderful , flowery hop aroma with just a touch of citrus backbone . nice hop punch in the front with the flowery taste and a mild malt middle on the drink . juast a hint of alcohol on the backend of the taste . not as hop-forward as some ipas , but this beer still satisfies . it has medium/light mouth feel , and a nice drinkability .'

S"i 've been comparing pumpkin ales this year , and since sh has a good reputation , this one was a must-try . pours a nice burnt orange color with a frothy head . smells like a pumpkin pie . nothing unusual as far as spices go , but no negatives either . think of this as the quintessential `` spice forward pumpkin ale . '' the spices are n't overwhelming or numbing , and the base beer is n't too bland either . it just does a nice job of having cinnamon , clove , allspice , vanilla , and nutmeg lead the way . not too sweet , and none of the spices seems to overpower the others . as it warms , different ones seem to come forward . there 's even a hint of hops in the finish to keep thinks drinkable . this is a great one-off beer . like most pumpkin brews , you 're not going to want a session ... however drinking two of these would n't be impossible . compared to the others , it 's one of the more drinkable versions . it 's right up there with the dfh and bj 's examples ... both of which are totally different takes on the style . if you like pumpkin beers , add this one to your yearly list of bottled versions to buy ."

S"perhaps i was expecting too much out of this beer as i have been doing a `` chocolate beer '' tasting series , and there are others that are better . however , here 's my take on it . a- it looks sort of.. not boring but , not particularly amazing . very dark brown , not at all transparent . poured with a big bubbly head which diminished fairly quickly and left just a lacing on top . s- the smell reminds me of tootsie rolls , sugar , and surprisingly cherry candy ( not real cherry ) , and i happen to really dislike cherry candy but if you like it , you 'll love the smell of this . however it has a strong aroma which is nice . note : drinking this beer while writing this , the cherry smell has given way to just chocolate/tootsie rolls as the beer sits . t- the taste is similar to the smell but more complex , it 's sweet and quite chocolaty but it 's not missing the malt and hops , they just take the backseat and a molasses sweetness finishes off the sip . you can also taste the alcohol in there , but considering this has 11 % alcohol , it 's masked somewhat . m- fairly viscous and a bit oily . somewhat syrupy but not the most sticky i 've drank . d - i 'd rather have a samuel smiths but for something that seems to be almost overpowering it 's not bad ."

S'pours a deep dark brown , almost black color that is completely opaque without even the slightest bit of lighter color when held to a light source . one finger fizzy mocha colored head that very quickly fades into a thin ring . nothing in the way of lacing . slightly roasted malt aroma with lots of silky milk and dark chocolate notes as well as hints of lactic cream , burnt toast , oatmeal , coffee bean and oatmeal . medium bodied and very roasty with a bit of overly acrid bitterness up front that lingers throughout into a long , dry finish . although this is very bitter and roasty with severe notes of burnt toast/malt , overly roasted coffee/espresso bean , toffee and oatmeal and ash , there is some slightly silky chocolate flavor along with hints of lactic cream . a bit one dimensional for my taste with nowhere near the chocolate milk presence described on the label . a bit disappointing .'

S"it 's almost too cloudy and not the best looker , but remains my favourite beer in the coopers range . like the sparkling ale , it 's malt-heavy and intentionally lacks complexity . while being slightly overcarbonated , it 's a drink perfect for sessions and as far as reputation is concerned has become an australian icon . due to its well-priced nature , it 's extremely popular and something i 'll continue to buy despite far superior imports ."

S'cask at the old market tavern in altrincham . light black with ruby highlights and a tan head that laced well . aroma of smoked chocolate ( if such a thing exists ) , and coffee . intense and lush chocolate flavours dominate the palate , initially similar to a block of dark chocolate , before tailing into a dusty cocoa powder . dark roast and toffee back this up to add a touch more complexity . certainly a pleasant and well-constructed range of flavours . smooth , medium body with restrained carbonation as a result of the cask pour . this was a damn drinkable porter , and easily sessioned at 4 % . recommended .'

S"this attractive brew splits the difference between the familiar nw hefe and the beloved bavarian original . it 's a ripe , fruity orange and a sturdy white head that does n't blossom as much as a bavarian but is still a good size . the aroma is waxy , yeasty , slightly off but not at all unpleasant . there 's also some bright citric hop flavors that let you know this was made in the us . the taste has wonderful composition , and is totally united without any flailing off-flavors or struggling elements that come short . everything is here and it 's rounded and refreshing . grapefruit hops lead off , followed by a cookie-sweet malt base , with the yeast and wheat providing a supple , almost oaky-chardonnay quality . it 's very drinkable . a very good hefe ; it does not manage to become the oft-attempted-but-nearly-never-succeeded craft american copy of a german , but it 's got a bit more going on than most of the pac nw hefes . it 's a fine and likable beer ."

S"a- poured from the tap with a thick creamy tan head . the head actually looks like fresh cream from a cow , and slowly recedes to a hazy layer with some nice lacing left behind . the body is a beautiful deep garnet color with no visible carbonation from the sides of the glass . s- smells strongly of almonds/marzipan . perhaps these aromas are from high alcohols being misperceived at colder temperatures ? there 's a nice background of caramel malt and candy sugar on the nose as well . do n't know if i 'm going to love or hate it . t- a perfect replicate of the nose for the first few sips . tastes delicious . but then , as the beer warmed , my fears came true and the distinct presence of fusel alcohols emerged . the aroma and taste of these high alcohols were so prominent that they began to elipse all other flavors ... and ultimately became flat-out unpleasant . i do n't want to drink anymore for fear of a raging headache tomorrow ... what a letdown . m- fusel alcohol issues aside , the mouthfeel was nicely firm and somewhat oily . the carbonation was super-soft and added a `` creaminess '' to the body . quite nice in the mouthfeel department . d- the high alcohols killed this beer , and absolutely ruined the drinkability . i think this beer has great potential . given the opportunity to sample an untainted batch , i could thoroughly enjoy it . note : this review only lasted for about 3 ounces before it became a drain-pour ... and sure enough i had a headache for the rest of the night ."

S"pours darker than amber , let 's call it acorn . nice and hazy . foamy cap brings to mind santa 's ( slightly dirty ) fluffy beard . lacing is decent but not quite what i would expect from the style . aroma absolutely crushes it . grapefruit for sure , but lively with other fruits ( not all of them identifiable ) and floral notes . taste is great , but somehow falls a little short of matching the nose . the hops are obviously up front , and while the malt is not completely invisible , this stays true to the style . the bitter finish lasts a bit longer than i 'd like . this is a fantastic beer . i 'm just a little confused by the label , which describes it as a hybrid between an american ipa and a winter warmer . i get none of the spices you 'd expect in a warmer , but that should n't take away from the beer . given the price ( less than $ 5 per bomber ) i will definitely buy this again , and i 'm glad it 's made its way to the east coast ."

S"this ipa delivers in presence . the beer is amber leaning toward dark . excellent head falling into a more than i 've seen in a while lacing . this beer smells like the damp wooded country where i camp . it's neutral in the malt/hops department . i get some of each , without one overpowering the other . dammit , i 'm ready to go camping now ! i can describe the smell as wooded , mossy , and fresh rain . the taste almost follows the aroma . the malt is more present in the flavor of this beer . the hops follow up offering to buffer the malt to bring a very nice semi-sweet crisp finish . all of this is happening in a fairly light bodied beer . i'ts on the skinny side of full . i need some more of these , hunting and camping season is here and a few of these at camp would make me want to stay a while . mccall , you nailed that one . thank you . you 're my hero for the rest of the day . i appreciate you sharing this beer with me ."

S'pours an amber color with a light beige/white head that is foamy . some grassy and piney elements to the aroma with a hint of citrus . slight malt taste initially , then the hops kick in hard , giving it a strong , piney , hoppy taste with citrus elements . light carbonation , good body . excellent ipa , but the taste and punch are so strong i can only have one before feeling overwhelmed by the flavors .'

S"thanks to steve for sending me this beer . a : the pour is very dark brown , almost black . very small to no off-white head . s : super boozy with a lot of roasted malt aroma . somewhat solventy with an ashy aroma to it as well . more than anything , though , the nose is booze . t : the flavor is overly harsh and boozy as well . i guess some booze is expected at such a high abv , but this is just too much . lots of roasted malt and charred flavor . not really enjoyable . maybe some tannic oak-type notes . m : medium to full in body with a moderate carbonation . o : could n't even finish more than a few ounces of this ."

S"a- pours with about a one inch head that slowly dissipates into a somewhat thick layer over the brew . the color reminds me more of a kristalweisen , in the fact that it is a perfectly light golden ... however it is n't perfectly clear imo . there appears to be moderate carbonation rising to the top and there is very little sticky lacing . fairly typical of a lager . s- overall a very clean smelling beer ... .primary aromas of faint malt and some graininess . no real hops on the finish to report . mainly just a mild adjunct laden aroma . t- again , an overall clean tasting beer ( i guess from the use of rice ) , with some grains and malt dominating the palate . i can taste a very muted hop bitterness on the finish that actually magnifies itself during the swallow . also to note , as it warms up , the malts are much more noticeable too . a bit adjunct-ish in general but still a step above the average macro . m- this is a fairly thin bodied brew , although i find it has more depth than a standard macro . the carbonation is surprisingly mild , making this a smoother than expected beer to down . d- full marks here ! this is very easy to drink , as it is flavorfull enough to want more , does n't scrub the palate with bubbles , and is a clean , crisp beer to enjoy on the deck , as i did for this review . anyone who like bmc should try this and i 'll bet will find it much more enjoyable ."

S"another out of date beer in my real ale sampler damn : ( a : golden with a slight copper hue , 1 finger head dissipates quickly . s : not much going on . smells like fireman 's # 4 with a bit more piney hop aroma . t : not bad , i prefer this to the brown ale i think . not nearly as hoppy as other apa 's i 've had , and not nearly as deep of a flavor profile , but nice . kind of minimilastic but in a way that makes it ok. m : nice mouthfeel not overly carbonated . a little on the thin side though . d : out of any offering i 've had from real ale , this is probably the best characteristic . all of their beers are extremely drinkable , i could slam several of these in rapid sucession with ease . once again , decent brew , just wish it was n't out of date"

S"i was pretty excited to find a new beer on-tap from paper city , but i was a bit skeptical having it at big city in allston , ma . what the hell , i 'll try it and support something new . the beer was presented as a very light pale offering in a american tumbler , absolutely flat and chill-hazed . aroma was extremely fruity , sweet and a stale oxygen taint that immediately put me off . i then tasted the beer . remember those little libby fruit cups with the tin pull-tops ? inside was a cornucopia of irradiated fruits , like peaches , pears , grapes and that illusive single cherry treasure . remember the juice ? the sweet fruity concoction formed from the marriage of these fine fruits . that 's exactly what this beer tasted like . the juice from a libby 's fruit cup . now i 'm not sure if this was how the beer was supposed to taste like this or if this was yet again another beer tainted by the sunset bar & grill beer curse ( bad lines / old beer ) or a combination of both ... but this was absolutely foul . a beer like this , or in this condition , should simply not exist . and the beer is called one eared monkey not one eyed money like the sunset bar & grill chain is advertising . its also a pale ale with peach flavoring , not a belgian ale like i was told by big city staff ."

S"i agree with todd whole heartedly with regard to being a good `` crossover '' for the taste challenged . in fact five years ago this beer ( & the whole tommyknocker family ) helped me discover new horizons with regard to quality brews . everything they make seems to be geared toward teaching the bud drinker ( with baby steps ) what good beer is supposed to try to be . that said , pick axe is nothing special . just a decent , fairly sweet , pale ale lacking traditional hoppiness that can help the novice discover what good beer can taste like ."

S"the avery website lists this as a strong ale ( english-stlye ) rather than a barleywine , but this may be splitting hairs ... i had a bottle from the july 2005 vintage that i drank at the end of november . it pours a transparent orange with good carbonation and little head or frothiness . good lacing . this is surprisingly light in color for a beer this strong and heavvy : a cool trait . the bouquet has a unique sour tinge to it , with hints of cotton candy . the taste is syrupy sweet with a heavy body and a long aftertaste of carmel and sugar . there 's a delicate hoppiness at the end of each sip that perfectly compliments the beer 's sweetness . at 14.5 % abv , the fact that there 's no alcoholic taste is a testament to the brew 's complexity and body . in fact , the body is remniscent of a nice cognac or desert wine . pricing a single 12 oz bottle at between 6.99 and 7.99 , the folks at avery know that they have a fine big beer here- one that is meant to be savored rather than sessioned . given the high abv and hole in my wallet , i 'm happy to oblige . a very special treat ."

S"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass . a : not the best looking dipa i 've seen . looked like a weaker , thicker version of some of the better dipa 's . an amber look to this beer with just a little bit of head and decent lacing . s : intense . i smell the alcohol right up front followed by a ton of hops . the alcohol definitely overwhelms the hops , but do n't doubt that you 'll smell the hops . probably more hoppy than any beer i 've ever smelled . t : honeslty , i tasted something that tasted like a shot of vodka in a barrel of hops . very full bodied beer that also had a bit of a fruity pineapple taste . by the time i got to the end of it and it was a bit warmer , the tastes of grapefruit or some sort of dry fruit came out big time . m : syrupy ! left nice oils in your mouth . i could n't get the hops taste out of my mouth for hours after i drank this beer . the oils and my love for hops gave this one a higher rating than most would give it . d : beer took me 3 hours to drink.. maybe a bit longer . i had to sip it like i was sipping a glass of scotch . could n't ever drink more than one of these at a time.. ever . highly recommend it , and i have one put away to try again in a year or two to try and see the difference . recommend that everyone try this one at least once ."

S"picked up a bottle at bauer on newbury street for this past friday night . after popping the cap , i got some overflow , not quite an explosion , but enough to spill down the sides . after letting it settle down a bit , i poured myself some into a belgian chalice . wow , there were a lot of chunks of yeast . too many , almost to the point of distraction . i let the glass sit for a bit , and upon first taste , i liked it . the taste was of caramel and fruit , with a smoothness that hid the alcohol level . but those chunks , they are hard to ignore . for the second glass , i poured extremely slow , and most of the yeast stayed in the bottle . this was an enjoyable beer now . but the third and final glass was 1/3 yeast chunks , so not so great . this is a great tasting beer , but i think i 'd only get it on draft , and never in a bottle again ."

S"this has been a brutal summer for me , moving from the west coast to the east coast , remembering the violent heat and humidity that i had once left behind . the city here traps the heat all day , bakes itself , leaves you warm and toasty down to your soul . at the end of a long day , you need something immensely quaffable . i 've been a fan of this beer for a while , but this summer my love for it bloomed . unfortunately , it is one of those beers that must be consumed cold . cold , the watermelon is in harmony with the wheat . it is obvious but not over the top , extremely complementary . once the beer warms a bit , the wheat comes out and you realize that maybe this beer is n't that good after all . i ca n't tell you what it looks like , because this approachable and very drinkable beer is best administered directly from the can . i , for one , ambitiously declare this one of my 5 beers of the summer . and as the last shipment has arrived at the store , i realize that i have survived my first summer in ny , and the leaves are about to change ."

S'ive had various vintages of this beer and if the others bottle of this years vintage are like this bottle then this must be the weakest of all . i was troubled when no lacing appeared after i poured the scarlet and caramel bodied brew into my pint glass . no head and no lacing . as the 7337 kiddies say these days wtf ? the ball gets rolling a bit with the nose . the hops leap out first with pine leading the charge . bitter grapefruit brings up the rear with buttery not-too-sweet caramel hand in hand . the finish reminds for some reason of rose petals and rich honey . its very nice . though this tastes great i find the thin mouthfeel distracting . no lie , this beer has the consistency of water . now im a water drinker myself . i dont drink any fruity or sugary drinks to quench my thirst , im a water guy . when i opt for a beer , i want a mouthfeel that reflects that . not only does this fail but it flunks with flying colors . id consider buying this again just to see if this bottle was a fluke . it tastes very good but the thin mouthfeel just kills it . a shame . i rated the drinkability low because of the mouthfeel . i considered making this a drain pour with every sip .'

S"nice caramel/amber color witht thick sea-foam head , good head retention and outstanding lacing . smell is alluring : cedary and woody , some lime zest perhaps and burnt sugar . initially a pleasing prickly hop bite on the tongue . the middle is juicy and fruity but rich -- a bit too rich for my tastes . a mixture of cedary hops and nutty almost smoky malt . hops dominate in floral bouquet and bitterness but the malty richness underneath is cloying . perhaps some of this cloyingness is due to the 9.10 % abv . naturally the above complaint takes points away from drinkability . finish is medium-length , hoppy ( cedar ) , and fruity . a potentially outstanding double ipa marred by a cloying richness . for my money , see stone ipa for a lesson is how to avoid this -- i.e . huge hops , high alcohol , without being cloying . having said that , this being a somewhat new/ '' experimental '' style , perhaps a double ipa should exhibit this kind of richness compared to something a like a stone ipa . in the end , still an exciting and great beer ."

S'thanks to calinalu for this bottle i split with a friend . a corked and caged 12.7 oz . bottle poured into a wine glass . served slightly chilled . 2009 vintage . appearance : deep dark brown in color . the lack of any head whatsoever really is disheartening . some sediment floats toward the bottom of my glass . aroma : nice bourbon , oak , vanilla , and some milk chocolate . a bit of heat here too but nicely balanced overall . taste : the rich bourbon and vanilla really stand out here , as does the heat from the alcohol . much less balanced and more boozy in the taste . there is also some oak and chocolate in teh background of the bourbon , but nowhere near as pronounced . mouthfeel : this literally fell flat here for me . this bottle was clearly carbonated badly and the entire beer suffered for it . more like a spirit than a beer unfortunately . drinkability : the heat from the booze and the completely falt mouthfeel kill it for me here . i was barely able to finish my half of the bottle . overall , a really nice beer but the carbonation on mine really killed it . the aroma was amazing and the taste was really complex . the booze heat and flat mouthfeel took hold though and made it less enjoyable .'

S"nice copper color with a medium tone to its body . nice capping of light tan foam sits atop in a firmly set smoothness . dwindles down to a good skim and solid collar as the lacing is mid-light with some spotting and strings . aroma is well rounded and favoring a mostly fruity , apples , pear , those sugary malt juices thing with a caramel glimp and a light floral hop and leafy dryness . taste is not quite as broad as what the aroma gives way to , but still is n't all that bad . rounded in more of a malty fruityness bringing an apple , pear , slight cherryish thing with a fair caramel lean along its front and middle . finish has a floral hoppyness that closes in on some woody/cardboard dryness into the finish . feel is clean , and medium/light with a calm yet active carbonation thats smooth and favors the malt base well . for some reason this stuff just glides right down with some amazing ease . really nice to drink . smooth and just the right amount of flavor and body to get its 'point ' across . but an apa ? i do n't think so . i totally thought i was drinking an amber . styles aside , this one favored well with me ."

S"appearance - hazy golden yellow , a thin layer of white bubbles . good lacing on the sides , seems a little light on content though . aroma - strong pine aroma . no fruit , all pine , got that ? one dimensional , but i hail from pine tree country so it 's all good to me . taste - some biscuity malt in the fore , quite brief , and then brash hoppy and metallic flavors . plenty of hops , just not much else there besides that core unsupported bitterness . not much development on the swallow & aftertaste , just some general dryness and raw hoppiness . no mistaking the style , that 's for sure . mouthfeel - thin for an ipa . well-carbonated and has some creaminess/smoothness but it could use more . drinkability - the sixer will drink and at first glance comes across as one i 'd probably not bother with . however , in retrospect , for a pleasant enough , available ipa that does n't ask $ 7 to $ 10 of me for a sixer 's worth , this one has its levels set more for enjoyment rather than review . this is one to sneak into a blind taste test to see if removal of megabrewer bias effects score ..."

S'pours deep amber with an off-white two finger head . decent head retention followed by mild lacing . aroma is of floral hops and sweet malt esters . rich malt taste upfront , followed by pronounced hops and residual sweetness . fairly well balanced for an american pale ale . light to medium bodied , the low carbonation and strong aftertaste make this less smooth but more robust .'

S"the beer arrived as pale as pale can be without being white . the head was slight by the time it hit the table ( and i do mean hit the table , the waitress spilled an ounce of so of it ) . the head did lace the glass . the aroma has a slight odd lemon characteristic to it . there is also a slight yeast aroma . the flavor contains slight bitterness , but no real malt or bitterness character stands out . the beer is very crisp , but as it warms that same lemony aroma comes out in the flavor . the finish is dry but not overly bitter . it is quite refreshing . the body is very thin , light and almost watery . on tap at bailey 's smokehouse in richmond ."

S"just got a shipment in from the k & l boys ... much love to bryan brick , the beer buyer there ! ! three fro gdbc and three from haandbryggeriet ! ! ! pours an inky , opaque black like the soul of glen benton . an upside down cross-crown of pure evil , dark tan head rises up a couple fingers and then recedes into the pit again . the lacing is sticky like the lake of fire ... my mouth waters ... very roasty chocolate malt spews forth from the glass to your nose . right now this strikes me as less an imperial and more a rich oatmeal stout . i like the hint of hops in the aroma profile - like someone sitting in purgatory and not yet released to the bowels of hell ... oh my - it 's an imperial stout alright ! the flavor is amazing . super rich and malty , but with a creamy texture and flavor that keeps the malt tang , that is usually more like satan 's trident , from piercing your taste buds . this is so robust it 's like a sipping whiskey . the alcohol at 9.5abv is hardly masked , and it shows it 's demonic head right around the middle , crushing your tattered soul and then hanging out while it watches your demise . i ca n't get over the huge malt character . it 's very close to rasputin in `` oomph ! `` , but smoother in every facet . the finish lines you up for satan 's call , and lets out an enormous hop burst , belching it into your face . very nice and refreshing , for a huge imperial . super-expensive at $ 7.99/bomber , so drinkability suffers a little . not a sessionable beer , either . this is for your last supper ... what i like most : the huge malt profile in the flavor . what i like least : the price and astringent , yet short , hit of alcohol . verdict : delicious , enormous and like satan - only right for some ."

S"thanks to assurbanipaul for this one . poured a 12oz bottle into my trusty chimay goblet . this beer pours a light straw golden with a little white head that melted away into a what reminds me a slight film on the top of the beer . the aroma is a mild sweetness , with just a kiss of hops and a little biscuit . the taste is odd . sweet but there is a touch of what reminds me of wheat malt . not much discernable flavors . the mouthfeel is light and mildly carbonated . it reminds me of every other shiner beer i 've had . they are all all right , nothing great , but easily drinkable ."

S"i had this pils in a 12oz . bottle poured into a tall pilsener glass . it pours a slightly hazy golden color with the largest head i 've ever seen . no matter how slowly you pour this one , the foam is unstoppable . it took me about 10 minutes to pour it . seriously , this is harder to pour than a duvel . there is lots and lots of thick lacing left on the glass . the smell is hoppy and grassy , reminds me of springtime lawn mowing . the taste has the same grassy effect , with a little clove or ginger spice . there is a little bit of hops on the back of the tongue . the mouthfeel is just a tad bit oily . the drinkability is awesome , and i could drink many more of these ."

S"had the opportunity to try this stout which was aged for 1 year in bourbon barrels . it was on tap at sunset on sat 8/09/08 . came served in a 8 oz snifter , which turned out to be more than enough . color was darker than night . no head to speak of . smelled like bourbon and oak . the first sip was a knock out . it was like drinking straight bourbon . wow , was it strong . my wife and i were both simultaneously amazed at how strong the flavor was and how good it tasted . the bourbon flavors outshined the stout flavors a bit , but we did n't mind . hands down the best beer that i have ever had from cbc . a small glass is all you need as it 's a whopper and sipping is called for . world class in my book ."

S"had this on tap and cowboy ciaos in scottsdale , az . it was the only tap beer i saw in the establishment , as this is a wine bar . a very attractive beer . nice amber color with a dense , pale 2 finger head and cascading carbonation . i could n't distinguish this beer from a sam adam 's boston lager on sight . smells of biscuity malt . very slight floral hops aroma . tastes of light malts with weak hops aftertaste that does n't really linger . nice moderate carbonation . light , effervescent , balanced , but kind of watery . definitely a sessionable beer . as this is among the first microbrews/craft beer , i have to think sam adam 's was modeled after this beer , which the character of this beer reminds me of . a good sessionable beer that would n't be too offensive to a bmc drinker . just a solid beer . nothing that really extreme , to impress me , but you really have to give this beer credit for starting the craftbeer/microbrew movement ."

S"pours in thick . its black in color like a porter/stout . has a healthy brown head and there is a lot of lacing going on evenly around the glass . smell is sweet and alcoholic . there is a lot of vanilla in the nose . the smell of vanilla extract and alcohol come together to create a bourbon scent that is very pleasing . smells exactly like jack daniels oak bbq chips . there is toasted malts , berries and alcohol present in the taste . the sweet malts are right up front hinting to you flavors of berries . then the alcohol comes in and dominates , then ends with a nice toasted coffee finish . has a smooth mouthfeel . its a little thiner than i anticipated but not bad . carbonation is just right , not too much not too little . i do n't think i could drink more than two of these . its a delicious beer but at 12 % wow . this is a big beer . its a sipper for sure . but a very enjoyable one . that being said i would definitely buy this beer again ."

S"a pretty tough beer to get just right . this beer starts off promising with good copper-rust color , great clarity , and withstanding head retention . smells moderately malty with a light underlying caramel hint . slightly hopped for interest . bready , lightly toasty , and lightly yeasty . the flavor are less successful than aroma . the toasty , bready flavors do n't come through the same . hopped a little higher than the malt can support causes the delicate bread and yeast flavors to subside a little too much . the body falls a bit watery , but the alcohols make a bold presence without becomming too hot . a little dry in the finish , but clean despite a lingering graininess . decent beer . i appreciate the attempt ."

S'founders imperial stout : pours a jet black , that no light can penetrate . very nice , deep brown head , with some lasting power , and that leaves thick coating on the glass . the aroma is very strong , with more than a little coffee/espresso aromas . as is typical for any imperial stout , this is a heavy , creamy mouthful . the tastes are absolutely dominated by the strong dark malts , with thick tastes of espresso , and hints of toffee and dark chocolate to boot . there are some hops towards the finish that leave a oily mouthfeel . definitely not a session brew , but one to linger over . a good us example , but not up to the level of say the rogue .'

S"12 oz bottle , brewed on 9/25/03 and bottled on 6/9/06 . pours a dark brown with a small fizzy tan head that quickly disappears . the aroma is very rich - chocolate , sweet dark fruit , cherries , honey , and a touch of alcohol that increases as it sits . the flavor is heavily sugary sweet and fruity ( plums and raisins and cherries ) with a little chocolate . there is a fairly harsh alcohol finish that is slightly bitter . the mouthfeel is is full and syrupy with low carbonation and an alcohol burn . overall , an interesting and complex beer , but too over the top for me - i could n't finish the bottle . it 's too sweet and alcoholic for me - too much like a liquor which i dislike . and at $ 11 for a 12 oz bottle , it 's pretty pricey ."

S'appearance : rich , clear , copper color with a large , coarse , off-white head that colapses into a foamy surface layer , leaving copious lacing . aroma : powerful floral hops and lightly modified grains taste : a smooth malt hit on the front of the tongue is followed quickly by an overpowering rush of floral hops flavor and brutal bitterness . this brew has mellowed dramatically after almost 2 months of aging . when i first brought it home , the hops were so overpowering that the beer was almost undrinkable . with age , a pleasant balance is emerging . aftertaste : unpleasant bitter flavor lingers on the middle and back of the tongue . mouthfeel : medium-to-full body with mild carbonation sediment : thin , somewhat loose layer on bottom of bottle'

S"nothing really makes this beer stand out looks wise . a melted caramel brownish color with a small white head that does carry good retention . not much imagination otherwise . sweet black cherry , with a toffeed malt hint and hints of oak . sweet fig , raisin , brown sugar , and berries also come forth as this beer mingles in the glass awhile . a tad of alcohol also is present . the problem is that all of the aromas are very subdued . hmmm . well i 'm thoroughly dissapointed in this beer . i 've been sitting on this for awhile now looking forward too the day of it 's demise . not sure if it 's a bad bottle or just old but not at all what i expected . lacking any complexity and not nearly the amount of oak to integrate i was imagining . well live and die by the bottle : ) . again lots of dried berries , hints of toffee , milk chocolate , cherry , and a lackluster attempt at oak aging . an obvious belgian yeast was used in this and i think allagash may have been better off using a traditional yeast with this one . thin and watery . as for drinkability ; considering it 's price i will never try this beer again . now i have all of these other allagash `` big beers '' in my cellar that i 've been looking forward too . hopefully the others will turn out better ."

S"draft service into a shaker pint glass at churchill 's in san marcos . a : clear , light amber color with less than one finger of very fine diminishing white foam head . heavy , step-wise , lacing remains on the glass . s : very mild , with faint multi-grain toast and floral and earthy -- tea-like -- hops . t : begins dry , with mild pale malt that shows a hint of caramel , delicate floral and herbaceous hop aromatics , and bright acidity of moderate intensity . malt becomes lighter , more crackery , in the middle where floral hops persist . hops turn more herbaceous , even coniferous , in the finish that is mildly bitter with faint mineral crispness . m : thin viscosity , wet and slightly acidic on the palate , with moderate carbonation . d/o : this session pale ale owns the distinction of being the forebearer ( and perhaps the inspiration for ) stone 's san diego session ale collaboration . as far as sessionable beers go , even keel goes one step beyond the beer it inspired , delivering its bounty in a package that is significantly under 4 % abv . it walks a fine line between being satisfying and underwhelming , as many in the sub-style slide toward . in this case it stays appealing and nuanced from start to finish , with layers of flavor emerging through sustained study . even keel is an accomplished session ale , but it is difficult to say that it is any better than the san diego session ale ."

S"poured from a green bottle into a pint glass . its not easy to get here in ri , but thankfully i 've got friends in pa who bring this down a couple times a year . beer pours a golden amber with a very light lacey head . smell is of a light malt , smells `` beery '' . the taste is of a light amber lager , nothing really special about it . i could put down quite a few in a night given the chance . at the price this sells at , you ca n't beat it ; around here though , there are better options ."

S'750ml bottle 2008 edition a- pours an amber color with a large off-white head that leaves a lot of lacing and possesses excellent retention as well . s- the aroma is filled with a lot of malt with caramel and honey . it is a very good malty aroma that is rather inviting . t- the taste like the aroma features a really nice malty base , with the hops coming out much more in the taste compared to the nose . the citric hops provide a nice bitterness in the finish . m- the mouthfeel is damn near perfect . the full body possesses a really nice texture with a perfect amount of carbonation . d- the hops can be a little harsh at times and it can get a little hot in the finish witch does hurt drinkability a little bit . not bad though . overall , double dead guy is a pretty solid brew that is definitely worth a try .'

S"pours a beautiful and clear straw color , topped by a white head of light foam two inches high . the head dissipates to a thin layer and leaves spots of lace on the glass . nose is an intoxicating and sweet perfume of banana , cloves , pear , apple and mild citrus , with a hint of grain and yeast . taste is the nose expressed as flavor , a bright flush of fruit and mild spice/citrus , sweet and refreshing with a finish that is moderately dry , but full of sweetness and just a ghost of bitter to balance . each sip intensifies as the brew warms and my taste sensors acclimate to the profile . this is a delicious brew , the best representative of this style i 've yet to try . mouthfeel is perfect for the style , light and drinkable for such a dextrinous body , eased into pleasing the palate by carbonation that borders upon being overly so . it is artistically prepared , and very satisfying . drinkability is the best thing about this beer . i could drink this beer till the raccoons sleep , and after ."

S"pours a glowing reddish sunset color , shades of burgundy/rust . head is thin and getting thinner as i type , yet it never fully disappears , remaining at a skim the whole time ( although i tend to shake/swirl my glass every few sips , so ... ) . absolutely great lace stickage , along with a ton of bubbles . i think it 's beautiful . very boozy nose . malt quantity seems generous , and the hops are definitely ready to rage , but the booze has the upper hand . it 's actually enjoyable enough , has a real intense cherry hard-candy/cherry syrup thing going on , but the flavor veers into cough medicine territory . yep , the flavor is rough . hops are prickly and bitter -- no problem there -- but the malt is wild and out of whack , resiny and even sour flavors work their way in , and the alcohol is intrusive . it 's not all bad , and in fact has some nice cherry cough drop flavor happening , but then the medicinal vibe starts elbowing in too much . lemonade-pucker starts appearing in the finish after half a bottle . not a drain-pour at all , but certainly a shadow of what could 've been . the texture is lovely -- round , gooey , full , thick , yet with enough carbonation to keep it lively ... pretty much how i prefer my big-ass ipas . with the out-of-whack flavor and overall booziness , this is not one i 'd revisit , although i 'm glad to have given it a shot . their grand illumination barleywine was much better . hopefully they 'll bring that back someday ."

S"i sampled this lambic at the cantillon brewery . for my first faro , i knew to expect sweetness , but not this much . the beer pours a distinctive glowing golden hue with absolutely no head whatsoever . carbonation is nowhere to be found , as this one is flat . candy sugar is present in the nose and certainly in the taste . to me , this one tasted like flat sprite as it was very syrupy . this is one of cantillon 's more limited offerings , however i do n't have much interest in trying it again ."

S"poured into a stange glass . pours with a murky dark yellow body and one finger of white that falls to a thin layer over the course of a minute or two . does n't look inspired . some muted noble hops , something rather chemical in nature and some pale malts make up the majority of the nose . i get what was supposed to be the lemon , but it does n't quite smell like lemon . sort of chemical hoppy . the taste starts off with an odd mr. clean sort of bitter flavor and `` cleans up '' into a nicer taste as it washes over the tongue . i sort of get lemon in this but it does n't taste very good . as this initial flavor goes down the malts make an appearance and show that this is indeed a beer despite what my initial impression might have indicated . mouthfeel is highly carbonated and average . feels nice just after a swallow . drinkability is below average . conclusion : i imagine that this is tasty if it is super fresh and served on tap . in the bottle and not fresh however , it does n't taste good . the first offering i have tasted from sam adams that did n't impress me in any way ."

S'been aging this bottle for a little over a year now pours a very hazy reddish brown with a frothy but short-lived red-tinged head . fairly sweet nose with a clean , fruity raisin aroma . more of that rich , fruity raisin character in the smooth , delicious palate along with sweet caramel , a touch of toffee , slightly syrupy malt and lightly toasted grain , especially towards the surprisingly dry finish . the standard of an american barley wine as far as im concerned . its especially smooth and refined and exceptionally delicious and drinkable . on a side note , in contrast with popular opinion , i really appreciate anchors approach here with regards to packaging ; where so many breweries carelessly put rich , intense and alcoholic brews into huge 22oz bombers ( stone brewing , im looking in your direction ) , anchor has gone in a completely different direction with their 7oz minis . not only should beers this strong or stronger be approached with moderation , but i personally dont always want to drink 22ozs of such robust , alcoholic brews . i highly recommend you by a six-pack of this and drink a bottle once every couple of months , it ages very well .'

S"from the quirkily-labelled bottle comes a dark red , light ruby , almost slightly purple coloured brew ; cloudy and robust . to call it `` dark brown '' would be a discredit . dark tangerine perhaps , but suffice it to say there are a great deal of different shades in the beer . the head was not overflowingingly massive , but just right . dark cream/coffee colour , intensely creamy with slow moving screen lacing . in the aroma i first detect must , dark mouldy yeast qualities , which is not unpleasant . next i smelt the dark malty sweetness , a warm alcohol note , and spicy fruit , nuts . there are strong grape juice aromas , and i definitely smell sharp aged cheese , which is singular . sweet candy , with some sour/acidic smells too . the sweetness is not cloying , but complements the dry musky yeast expertly . the taste is quite unique , with dark malt sweetness and fruity yeast . sugary sweet liquidy fruits , dry yeast finish , smooth syrupy on the middle . prunes , overripe peaches or tangerines , and some caramel , bready cereals , toasted flavours , and saltiness . the lees tasted separately give all the same flavours except the potency is doublefold , and it looks as thick as melted caramel . mouthfeel is full , lingering , syrupy , dry , with medium carbonation . high alcohol , extremely sweet mouthfeel followed by high dryness does not render this extremely drinkable . perfect for an occasional indulgence , though ."

S"mmmm ... stout . who does n't love a good stout or a porter on a cold winter night ? sure , certain beer folk will tell you that a porter is just as good on a sweaty summer day and well , i 'm not going to tell them to shove it but i 'll put it this way . i like to attempt to cook with beer . it 's fun . i splashed some allagash white on my asparagus one evening and have n't looked back since . but would you make a stew with a crisp summer ale ? nah , you 'd probably add some stout to that stew . and nothing says winter to me more than getting the dutch oven full of some lovin ' . what i 'm trying to say is 't is the season to find a good stout . and stone coast 's jamaican style stout is just the thing . i mean , this brewery is from maine -- they should know what to drink in the winter time , no ? pitch black ( or brown ) . ca n't see any light through the glass but there 's a bit of red around the edges . sticky light brown head that leaves the proper rings around your glass as you imbibe . a little bit of a heath bar aroma and taste . a bit more pronounced when you drink it than the smell would lead you to believe . very tasty with a kiss of the hops - more than your average stout . it 's a subtle beer , especially since its abv is 7.4 % and you ca n't tell at all . it 's not a creamy stout like a guinness -- it 's thinner , velvety , and a bit lighter than the kind of stout you might be used to . in fact this is the perfect kind of stout for the summer ."

S'crystal clear ruddy copper hue . frenetic carbonation supports a tall , steadfast , cream white head that yields frothy lace . understated toasty vienna malt with a medium caramel fringe dominates the aroma . subdued herbal hops and a trace metallic twang are secondary . lacks the intangible melanoidin presence of a prototypical vienna , but is clean and well rounded , albeit tame , aromawise . in flavor , prevalent in malt backbone is a stately toffee and caramel sweetened light toast impression . malt sweetness does not become cloying , due to both the functional hopping and ample attenuation . becomes slightly savory as it warms , with lightly buttery , slightly salty biscuit hints arising . moderate in body , with a suitably dextrinous , but brisk mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing . hop bitterness augments over time , thus drying the overall flavor profile agreeable . finishes immaculately clean , with a combination of herbal hallertauer and simple maltose sweetness fleeting quickly . a well crafted , albeit prosaic vienna . perhaps it was brewed with domestic malts ? regardless firebrick is well rounded and superbly drinkable . thanks to mr. fmonk for the delivery !'

S"alright - if you 're drinking this beer indoors , stop immediately and proceed to the nearest patio / deck / beach / etc . for this ale , indoors = blah ... outdoors = yes ! ( a la marv albert ) . the appearance of this ale is nice : it pours a bright , honey gold with a fluffy white head that dissipates yet maintains a presence throughout consumption ; lots of tiny carbo bubbles . the beer has a slightly earthy aroma , with some sweet malty notes and is a touch bready - aroma is kind of typical of a bottle conditioned ale . the taste starts off sweet , but has a nice , light bitter finish - hints of spice throughout ; definitely not something that 'll sweep you off your feet . mouthfeel is light-medium bodied , nice carbonation for a summer brew . this stuff is quite drinkable - kind of surprised that the abv is 5.8 % ( seems like it should be lower ) - very refreshing ! again , probably enjoyed best outdoors on a nice sunny day -"

S"figured that i would try this on tap before i went out and splurged on a case . poured into a snifter at tj 's . the color is a beautiful deep rich ruby with hues of copper infused with rust around the edges . the head is about a half-finger thick , and there is a slight amount of lacing , as well as some spotty gobs that stick to the edges of the glass upon a swirl . the most notable characteristics of the nose are the prominent citrus and grassy hops . there is no pine to be found . however , the bitterness that i expect is not there . the palate brings on an almost noble hop-like earthiness and grassy character . again the bitterness is muted . i get an almost vodka-like astringent grainy alcohol flavor that takes all of my focus away from the beer . i ca n't get past it . this 13.6 % tastes closer to 30 . i ca n't make out any malts aside from the grains that contribute to the boozy flavor . somewhat smooth , but relatively harsh on the palate , even for a dipa . i am used to having my palate thrashed , but that is by bitterness , not because of the overwhelming alcohol flavors . i could n't even finish the whole snifter 's pour . there are much better and well-balanced double ipas out there . seek them out and exhaust those options before you pursue this one , unless you just want a fast buzz ."

S'crystal clear ruby red notes with microscopic carbonation and spotty legs in the glass . sour tart apple and mouth watering citrous notes . ciderish lambic scents as well . cinnamon sprig scents . cider and cherries all the way . spices of desserts like apple pie with the crusts . tacky aftertaste . raw in a way like pure unprocessed cider . back of the tongue is an assault lingering sugar . thin super thin body and lightly carbonated leads to high drinkability . last swigs : first tried chilled and then 150 degrees . when hot more cinnamon and apple tea like with sweeter hot cider notes . beer is good . happy cold and hot beering .'

S"pint served at cheeseburger in paradise in woodbridge , va. a : rusty copper color , with absolutely no head and very little lacing . s : not really much of anything other that a very mild , sweet malt . t : mild , not exciting at all . slightly sweet malt and very miniscule amount of hops . not bad but not good . m : thin and watery , little carbonation . d : very drinkable , goes down very easy . everyone can drink it . it is not great but it is not that terrible . the choices were like bmc light and this . if i ca n't have real beer , this will do fine ."

S"vintage 2005 bottle poured into my trusty pint glass . this is a gorgeous beer . it is a deep orange color , almost red . there is an impressive three fingers of head , which sticks around for awhile . good lacing , great head retention . when i popped the top and began to pour , my entire kitchen started to smell like pumpkins . this is a very pungent beer . but more than anything , when you get your nose right down in the glass and takea good whiff , this beer smells like honey . maybe honey witha little pine resin in it , but mostly honey . at first it is intriguing , but the smell becomes borderline cloying ( if a smell can be coying ) . the taste is sort of like being kicked in the mouth three different times in three different ways . first , there 's the carbonated , alcoholic kick . then there 's a veritable depth charge of maltiness ( read : almost cloying ) , then there 's a massive hoppy dry finish . while all three of these categories seem overdone in their own stage , i like the interim periods . the malty backbone comes as a sweet relief after the initial onslought , and the hops come to the rescue once the maltiness becomes too much . more specifically : the maltiness is accompanied by the taste of pumpkins and acorn squash . there is a very nice mid-palate smokiness that transitions between the maltiness and the hoppy finish , and in many ways , the smokiness is the saving grace of this beer . the overall taste of this beer is really a shame , because it has some intense and interesting flavors in all aspects , but they just do n't seem to be balanced . the hops do n't balance the huge malt presence , they just pour salt in the wound that is your palate . in terms of mouthfeel , this beer is incredibly viscous . i 'd say `` chewy '' as well , but it really seems like it does n't want to be chewed . imagine chewing molasses . it just would n't work . drinkability ? let me put it to you this way : i 've been nursing this puppy for over an hour , and i 've got about 4 oz left . for the trecord , there is still a very nice layer of lace on top ."

S"thanks to a friend for sharing this from a st. bernardus variety 6-pack ( awesome ) . poured a mostly-clear dark amber with a tall white head and lacing . this beer strikes me as being two things : spicy and drinkable . at nearly 7 % , this baby drinks like a mild thanks to the dry and thin body . as for the spice , phenols are the dominate flavor-maker , with a red peppercorn bite next to the also spicy hops . the malt provides a subtle toffee back note for the spice and help create the delicate balance . this beer could have a little more flavor , but i 'll be damned if i could n't put down a number of these without thinking about it ."

S'picked up this and chilled it down for a rainy night . pours a deep copper color with an inch of white head . fades to a collar around the glass with lacing all over the glass . smells of malts , smoke , and light flowers . taste is of smoke and caramel with a herbal and flowery finish . very enjoyable mouthfeel is moderate and not sticky . nice amount of carbonation , not prickly but lets you know its there very good drinkability , the bottle goes down easily and very enjoyable .'

S"poured from a 24 oz can into nonic pint glass . a - clear , golden yellow . suprisingly , a full three fingers of head form . retention is fairly decent for the style and abv and a patchy film remains . a bit of lace sticks as well . s - dry grain husk and a fusel alcohol aroma . a sort of sickening candy sweetness pulls through also . t - overall this is probably an average tasting malt liquor , but the alcohol is entirely too noticable . typical malt liquor sweetness , very saccharin like . grain husk tries to dry things out but huge alcohol astringency pulls through and makes things unpleasant . finishes with a strange sweetness . m - almost medium bodied , almost cloying . carbonation starts out strong but fades quickly as the beer sits , adding to the cloying factor . d - a little less drinkable than some malt liquors because of the huge alcohol presence . sweetness grows as the beer warms . it is ok if you wan na get wasted , but i 'll either be choking the rest of this 24 oz down or pouring it down the drain ."

S"750ml poured into stella glass appearance : ruby/brown with a one inch white head . slightly translucent . smell : brown sugar right away , then bittersweet chocolate , dark fruits , and citrus . smells nice and complex . taste : plenty going on , sour cherry , grape and toffee start it off and it finishes with some chocolate , spice , and a small hop bite at the end . the taste is just as complex as the smell and that 's a very good thing . mouthfeel : very smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation . medium bodied so not too much to take . drinkability : so-so . i definitely am not cruising through this bottle but i would pick one up again to share with someone . overall : having had a belgian double earlier in the day it gave me a good basis for comparison and even though this is an american brewery 's take on a belgian double , i enjoyed this more . pick it up if you can , there 's only 1800 ."

S"appearance : poured from a growler into a standard pint glass . cloudy and opaque orange color with a very nice , somewhat creamy , thick head resting on top . excellent retention on the head , but only 10 % coverage or so on the lacing . smell : outstanding nose , one of the best i have smelled . floral and sweet . an absolutely delicious smell . taste : grapefruit and flowers with a nice bitter finish and aftertaste . not nearly as sweet as the nose , but enough to balance the hops out a bit , but not too much as to overshadow them . mouthfeel : light and pleasant . not overpowering or heavy . split of the growler with my girlfriend over dinner and it was the perfect amount . even with a couple glasses a piece it did not weigh us down or get us too tipsy . overall : between the two breweries and one other trip to a local bar during our trip , we must have sampled 20+ beers from columbus . this was easily my favorite of them all . columbus 's finest . whether the people of columbus appreciate it or not , this one deserves it 's a-rating from ba ."

S"brought it to a tasting today , this was one of the last beers we had . appearance is as you would expect . a night-black imperial stout with some goodly head retention . aromatics were top-shelf . you got the roastiness you 'd expect , plus the citrus hops of a dipa , or a `` black ipa '' like stone ssr . highly potent . huge beer . almost a confusion as to what 's going on , but it works . citric hops and roast jostle for position , and you never really know which is winning . in this young state , the 11 % abv is n't shy either , but it does n't become a distraction . still , a massive beer . and as much as we all enjoyed it , i do n't think any of us could have fathomed polishing off the bomber ourselves . pretty bitter , and alcoholic without being what i 'd consider `` hot . '' interesting hybrid feel . not as thick as you 'd expect an 11 % stout to be . this just continues the recent goose island trend of knocking basically everything they brew out of the park ."

S"pours a light copper color with a 1/2 inch white head . carbonation is visible . head recedes to a splotchy film across my glass and leaves stringy lacing . the smell blew me away , it is sweet , grassy and floral . i almost feel that it could be described as smelling like an oregon forest . the taste starts with a slight sweetness then i get a tangy citrus . body is a little on the thin side but it has nice carbonation . overall , this would be a great beer for a summer day when you do n't want a full bodied ipa , but do n't want to sacrifice the hops . my expectations were not high for this beer , but it really surprised me . this is really not meant to compete with inversion ipa , or laurelwood workhorse , but i think it fits a niche of hoppy lawnmower beer ."

S"primus ponies ! ! on a walking excursion through bruges , me and a pal happened upon a ten pack of primus pony bottles with a `` big-mouth '' top ( like mickies ) . it was a standard continental pils with the lightest flavor and aroma of malt , and no detectable hops but to dry it all out enough to be potable . what ensued was an obscure journey through the back alleys and neighborhood playgrounds of inner bruges , where we were surrounded at one point by unsupervised children and pestered with questions in flemish and english . it was refreshing to be in the comapny of children who take beer drinking for granted , and instead focused on other aspects of our unusual presence ."

S"another dogfish head brew is lost on me . i drank this beer after having it for at least one year ( survived two moves ) . i do not think this altered the taste negatively . apple-cider looking , a raw brown , deep-haze colour . very thin head that kept a full glaze and leaving rings throughout . apple cider nose with an alcohol punch . woody with faint vanilla notes entwined throuhgout . poingnance comes from alcohol , not the hops . different nose , but not neccessarily good to me . barleywin-like alcohol bite . burning-alchomalt conjures in my mind . woody ( mahogany , according to the label ) and mild vanilla flavours ( adds to alchol ? ) . i do not taste the 'maple . ' the sugar/alcohol tastes are blurred to me . very full and slick body . alcohol burn is interesting . oddly , no aftertaste and finishes dry . a glorified barleywine ? this brew misses me . overdone . i can understand the aspects of this brew , but it is not for me . maybe a deep-winter brew . cheers"

S"my girlfriend suprised me with a 6-pack of this after a long day of work and grad school . i had never seen this beer in the ohio area- not sure if its new to the area , or if i had just always glanced over it . i was also suprised to find that it is a brooklyn brewery beer . the beer pours a dark amber color . very faint smell of pumpkin and possibly cinnamon spice . i 'll tell you though- the smell is very faint and very difficult to pick up for a pumpkin ale . tastes like an ale that had just the faintest of pumpkin spice added to it . now i admit i am a fan of beers that often have overpowering flavor- so maybe i 'm being a bit harsh- but this is ridiculous- where is the pumpkin ? ? ? the beer is smooth and a bit thicker than your normal ale , but overall has a nice mouthfeel . like most ales for me this is very drinkable- by that i mean its easy to drink a lot of these . i just wish there was more flavor , more aroma . this is not what i think of when i think pumpkin ale and the fall . this is to easy to drink in the warm weather . i 'll pass next time ."

S"a : stark black with a sandy , creamy head . bottle is dated as best enjoyed by aug. 18 , '08 , so it 's a touch dated - but the style dictates that it will typically be just fine for a while afterwards . s : a toasted malt ( over being roasted or nearly burnt ) , coffee notes , some nuttiness . t : straight up coffee flavours - more a natural malt-flavouring hinting towards coffee rather than flavours brought out by infusing a beer with coffee . notes of unsweetened chocolate are in there , as well . hints of charcoal . a very light sweetness on the end that tops things off . very nice . m : a nice creaminess that is reminiscent of a milky drink . carbonation works together with that beautifully . if this is what the little age overdue causes , i 'll take more just like it . fantastic . d : a big beast . it goes great lengths to hide that , but in the end , the alcohol trumps . easy does it , or it might hurt in the morning ."

S"2002 it pours to a hazy orange color that sits nicely under a thick covering of white foam . the aroma first comes off as sweet and fruity , but there is a great mix of spices in there . the flavor is very welcoming and interesting . it is sweet with nice malts and fruits at the start . as is slides down , it starts to get bitter and spicy from the hops . i guess that the juniper berries have something to do with that also , but i am really not familiar with juniper berries , so i ca n't really say for sure . it is very crisp and refreshing . i would imagine it to be a great warm weather drinker , but i am enjoying it just as much after walking through knee deep snow . maybe i will go make some yellow to honor this fine brew from rogue ."

S"750ml corked & caged bottle into a weyerbacher tulip ; shared at a tasting . a : clear medium-gold body with a nice finger of frothy head . solid . s : a little spicy , a little cheesy , and quite fruity - moldy apples and tart cranberries . not that great . t : opens with some malt , then some fruity , then some spicy esters before a dull , nothing , slightly boozy finish . disappointing . m : lively , medium body . a highlight , but not enough to save the brew . d : i 'm already tired of this after half a glass . into the bucket it goes . notes : i had high hopes for this one , as it was highly recommended by others at the tasting who 'd had it before ( including chris , who brought it - thanks ! ) . we all quickly agreed that however good this beer might have been at one time , this bottle was a thin shadow of a saison . tank 7 and saison-brett are on deck , so let 's hope that boulevard gets their act together for the rest of the horizontal . cheers !"

S"procured a six pack at the grocery mart . poured into a standard pint glass . a : super clear golden yellow . fizzy white foam that dissipates quickly into a little lacy head . looks clean and good . s : corn , bread dough , some earthy , somewhat metallic undertones . t : initially sweet corn and bread followed by a slightly bitter finish . awesome mouthfeel ; light and bubbly . begs you to take another sip . drinkability : very drinkable . gives somewhat of a headachey buzz . value : at around $ 4.00 a six pack , this is my go-to cheap beer in a pinch . has a bad reputation that far exceeds the reality of this likable beer . the truth is , if you poured this into a blind taste testing , lots of people could n't tell the difference between miller high life and some way more pricey adjuncts . obviously , high life is not an excellent beer ; but in the style , it stands out as one of the best . note : i recommend the bottles over the cans ."

S'thanks to coldmeat23 , with the hookup on this beer in a recent trade . there is a healthy pop from the cork when opened . pours a ruddy brown with a tan cap that doesnt stick around long . the head recedes to a ring , with lace slowly climbing down the glass . looks nice ... the smell is faint . there is some oak , some funk , some vinegar , but it is very faint . it is not very indicitive of what is lurking in the taste ... the taste is freaking so puckering it is ridiculous . i feel like im being body slammed by the sour . there is some funky yeasty flavors up front , followed by straight vinegar , and cheek shattering sour ... it is too sour to enjoy this one on your own , i would suggest at least one other person to split with , possibly two . the drinkability suffered on this one due to the extreme nature of the sourness . i could never follow this one up with another of the same ...'

S"pours a slightly hazy orange-copper . not much visible co2 in the body . initially a solid cream-colored head , about two fingers thick . head leaves thick covering of lace atop the beer , and some rather thick trails of lace on the glass . malty aroma , sort of a biscuity caramel , with plenty of herbal/grassy hop notes . flavor is fairly light . malt flavor is initially rather subdued while a bigger-than-expected-hop-presence leaps forward on the palate and lingers in the aftertaste . malt begins to come out as the beer warms . bready initially , but more and more caramel became apparent during the beer 's short stay in my glass . light-bodied brew , but very smooth and oily . very drinkable session beer ."

S"( served in an american pint glass ) a- this beer has a light antique copper body that clear but to dense to read through . there is an off-white head that has a faint hint of yellow in it that last and last . a good carbonation of tiny bubbles . s- the smell of fresh good malt that is lightly toasted with a balance of spicy hops with a hint of earthiness to them . t- the taste of malt that a complexity like floor malted grain with a nice green , spicy hop flavor that is boosted by a slight alcohol taste . there is a dry ginger hop spice that hangs on the finish . m- this beer has a medium full mouthfeel with a faint alcohol heat that is just enough to enhance the hop taste . d- this beer has nice complexity and good flavors that blend nicely . this beer goes down really quickly so i 'm glad to know that it is a 7.2 % abv . the hops and malt are a bit to big and complex to drink it as a session beer but it is a great after work drink ."

S'bottle poured into english pint appearance : golden amber , slightly cloudy , very lively . half finger head dissipates quickly and leaves a thin off white film that last till the end ; little lacing . nose : earthy floral hops , little carmel malt , pleasant crisp smell . taste : heavy earthy hops with notes of pine and citrus , backed by slightly sweet almost carmel malt . mouth feel : crisp and lively , slightly dry . drinkability : balance between hops and malt is not as great as it should be with an apa and the earthy flavor is a bit too strong . this is defiantly not dogfish heads best beer , but you will be able to finish that six pack .'

S'another nice surprise from val-dieu , this dubbel pours out deep russett brown with an attractive crimson cast when held aloft . vigorous carbonation produces a frothy 2 fingers of near-white merangue that behaves well and leaves delicate patches of lace . aroma is somewhat subdued , with a caramelized toffee and powdery cocoa note leading to musty grape , cherry , and over-ripe orchard fruits . flavor is better than the nose would lead you to believe . semisweet roasted malts and fruit nuances of red grape and rotting cherry are balanced by musty concrete and mineral notes with a well hopped finish that is nearly dry . not as complex as i hoped for but supremely drinkable . body hovers just below medium , with a sticky mouthfeel and expansive , bubbly texture . no trace of the 8 % abv , rather high for this style . again , very easy to put down a 750 meself . would pair nicely with a burger or game .'

S"served in a pint glass thanks to tmoney2591 for providing what i 've been told is beer this beer pours a viscous deep golden color . due to the high abv it 's understandable that there is no head to this hard liquor of beers . the smell could strip the paint of a house , god damn is it strong . there 's no hops no malts , just pure ethanol in the aroma . it 's not horrendous , but i expected better from this beer i guess . the taste honestly is n't as bad as i had anticipated that it would be . that having been said there was some orange , and caramel notes before they got burned off of your tongue . i have the feeling that this beer would be much better like 10 or 20 years down the road , because it needs to mellow out big time . this is not really easy to drink . i only finished my allotment due to being challenged . it 's ok , but one hell of a novelty ."

S"best by jan 29th 06 , this bottle should be pretty fresh . pours nicely into the pint glass , perfect size head but the bubbles are a little lumpy . orange color is nice but hints of yellow detract . nice head retention , although at the end the head formed into chunks on the top ... i do n't think it 's mold , but that 's very weird . smells of cloves , spices ( in a somewhat belgian way ) and pumpkin , along with sweet malts . i wonder if they used the same yeast as in normal bm . this smells delicious , close to pumpkin pie . some good , some bad on the taste . cloves and some pumpkin flavor dominate , which is how the pumpkin ale should be . i 'm not sure this is a pumpkin `` ale , '' more like a pumpkin amber lager . too heavy on the spice and the sweetness but i 'm glad they are n't afraid to go all out . very little bit of hops on the finish ; this tastes almost like an all-malt lager . a little bit of artificial chemical taste brings it down . mouthfeel is watery and overcarbonated , yucky finish . i could n't drink many more of these . because it 's pretty over the top , the sweetness and spicing gets a little sickening by the end . nice as a single , though , to get you in the halloween mood ."

S"written on the bottle : red rocket ale is a bastardized scottish style red ale packed with distinctive flavors and an aggressive hop character rivaled by none . this unfiltered , bottle-conditioned , amber colored ale breaks all style modes . brew master notes : keep refrigerated , beer is perishable , real ale is alive , yeast is good , ferve a 45-50 degrees f. poured into duvel goblet appearance : deep , hazy brown with light tan head the dissipates into sticky lace . smell : hops with coffee aroma - roasted malt character . taste : nutty , the bitter with some lingering sweetness in the back of the throat . the finish is bitter . this brew is fun to drink - there 's quite a bit going on here . rich burnt aroma now . flavor is getting a little muted as it rests - its beginning to warm and evolve . the nose is fantastic - so complex . still roasted nuts on the palate . i would definitely serve this beer with cheese . mozarella di bufala and roomano ( the dutch cheese ) it 's heavy and rich and hard to get through the large bottle . at second glance , there 's about two inches of yeast in my glass - hard to drink that ! definitely bottle conditioned !"

S"got this in the cans because of price compared to bottles . first look showed little head with just a tiny bit of lace around the top of the glass . amber to light brown , it looks like an augustiner . smelled much the same too without the cheapness edge of auggie . just a note more richness in hops , but not enough to make it stand out . mouth was a little better than average as the foam picked up a bit and it had a more bottled aftertaste without noticeable can tastes . tasting for a defining flavor , there really is n't a stong winner . hops balance with a little bitter , almost a jwd hb sweetness to it , but not unwelcome . there was n't a adjunct flavor i could tell and no harsh flavors . i 'd say this is better than auggie , but perhaps it was how fresh this tasted in a can . drinkablity is high on price and freshness in cans . i have pretty much stopped buying cheap canned beer so this was an exception . got ta see if it is different from the bottle . at the bottle price , i 'd prefer the black and tan , but this still is the real reason why more casual beer drinkers are turning off bmc when they can get this ."

S"what can i say about this beer that has n't been said . $ 7.45 for a 6 pack is one of the cheaper beers in ontario and its a big step up above yankee jim but not as flavourful or tasty as lakeport honey or laker red . the pour creates a regular two finger head , the usual pale macro yellow familiar with molson canadian and labatt blue . taste is smooth , not very flavourful , goes down easy . tastes of corn adjuncts dominate the flavour . when you buy this beer you know what to expect however when your on a tight budget and you see $ 10.95 for molson canadian or labatt blue and then you see $ 7.45 for lucky , i can tell you from a lot of experience..you will not tell any taste difference between them . a `` ok '' beer for the cheap hearted but nothing to write home about ."

S"a - pours a light brown with an inch of off white head that quickly receded leaving little lacing . s - slight yeasty/fruity aroma with a slight citrus note t - a brief malty note fades quickly as the bitter hops , fruity esters , and alcohol hit all at once leaving an almost minty aftertaste along with lingering bitterness . not what i expected , i would consider this more of an abbey pale if it had more aroma hops . m - the mouthfeel was probably the most disappointing , quite watery . d - very drinkable , mostly because there was n't much there to savor , i could pound this stuff on a hot day , which would most likely end in disaster though some of the style characteristics were there i think this one lacks the richness that i enjoy from an abbey ."

S"12oz can poured into vintage grain belt mug . bottom-opened and poured carefully , this still did n't keep the head from settling rather quickly in my vintage glass , but the mere glimpse of eggshell-white froth was more than adequate . as it dissipates , the head leaves a kind of sticky froth on the sides of the glass , forming a ring atop the hazey , golden blonde liquid ( which is brilliant aside from the slight chill-haze ) . nose is fairly grainy malt , with a hint of a adjuncty-fusel character . i 'm also catching a mild hint of lemony hop , but very , very faint . i was kinda hoping for a bit more bite here . . . light , mildly-sweet on the first sip and with a very mild bitterness bringing a hint of dryness here toward the end . i want to say this strikes me as a `` boring '' beer , but i 'll go one better and say it 's `` comfortable '' or maybe comforting ; a meat-and potatoes beer , or maybe a beer and brat beer . this reminds me a hell of a lot of grain belt `` premo '' from minnesota , minus that beer 's light-stable hop extract : ) a fine beer overall , for what it is ."

S"22oz capped bottle . some scattered notes on this while consuming while listening to oxbow 's `` serenade in red '' ... appearance is solidly deep and dark and rich , with a gorgeous amber-gold rim and light red-brown tones leading in to the total darkness . nose is radicaly intense ultra-dark chocolate crossed with pure and fresh ground espresso . brilliantly strong and pungeant , while quite lovely and soothing . you can smell this one from a distace , and boy is it pleasant . awesome . taste is , yeah , i 'd say exceptional . layered and full-on , full-bodied flavor consisting of more of that radically rich and intense dark chocolate , the best damn cup of espresso you 've ever experienced , the best dish of chocolate ice cream you ever did have , and just intesity of chocolate and coffee flavors working in sync , in harmony , and in concentration . unreal . mouthfeel is luscious and smooth , velvety smooth . high end milkshakes without the cold headache , high end chocolate without the fat day feelings of bloatedness . long , long , long finish-just follow the chocolate brick road . god damn almighty ... notes : one hell of an intense brew , and perhaps one of the very best examples of a coffee stout on the market . the coffee is worked within the brew itself , rather than standing out within the brew , as in `` who the hell knocked their espresso into my beer ? '' definately not something you are going to drink daily , weekly , or maybe even bi-weekly . something you pull out of the cellar or take down off the shelf once in awhile and share with good friends after dinner or experience by yourself in the right moment . what inkwell has got over this one is the fact that inkwell can be drunk daily or even hourly . this is , however , in a word , dessert of the highest quality . stunning and a must try ."

S"first off big thanks to khiasmus for procuring this bottle . i 've wanted to try this for a while , but have been put off by the price . with something as bizarre as utopias , it 's tough to know where to begin . this is the strongest , strangest , most un-beer like `` beer '' i 've ever had . much like dogfish 's fort or 120 minute , utopias will grab your notion of what you thought a beer could be and give it a good thrashing . this being the case , the best way to approach super-strong brews like this is to treat them like they 're not beer , but rather a liqueur or a strong drink , say , port . anyways , other people have covered this exceptional brew fairly well in the reviews below . let 's hit on just a few highlights . utopias is completely flat . no carbonation of any kind . it 's a burnt-amber brown and quite clear . syrupy is a good start . this has the biggest alcohol legs of any beer i 've ever encountered . yes , more than dark lord . ( i 'll wait for the collective gasp . ) if you stick your nose too deep into the glass , the alcohol stings your eyes . the smell is wildly complex . everyone got different things out of it , but common notes were maple , vanilla , oak , raisins , and sherry . the finish is astonishing . more akin to a scotch than anything else , it 's long and embracing and warming . i tasted no less than three different nuances from the casks . sherry , toasted oak , and madeira . it took me about 45 minutes to drink two ounces of utopias , and i was hurrying . two ounces was plenty . was the experience ( and make no doubt , this was one ) worth it ? for sharing with friends , as we did , very much so . i would not recommend dropping the $ 150 - $ 200+ on a bottle for a single person alone . utopias is good , yes , but two hundred smacks still buys a *lot* of good beer . if you get a chance to sit 'round a fire and sip this beer with your favorite people in life , do n't pass it up . it 's a hard beer to get into ; if you enjoy scotch and fine after dinner drinks you 'll have a better time of it . utopias may not rock your world , but it 's certainly an unforgettable beer experience . and is n't that what us beer geeks live for ? jim koch , i tip my hat to you . or would , if i had one ."

S"big thanks to beerfmandy for this bottle recently . he knocked it off my wants . bottle poured into a standard conical pint glass . this is one of the darkest porters i 've ever poured . utter blackness like dirty motor oil . very viscous as well . a small mocha head tops it off . lots of lacy webbing on the glass . the nose starts sweet with notes of creamy milk chocolate , more dairy , and finishes roasted with hints of espresso and ground coffee beans . the heavy look carries over to the feel . moderate chew to this one . carbonation is in the background , just bubbly enough . hefty beer . i 'm not sure exactly if i have much experience picking out juniper flavor , but this beer says that it is brewed with juniper berries . there is an almost bittersweet twang on the back end of this one , that i can only guess is juniper berry ( ? ) . otherwise this beer is all roasted , almost to a fault . the heavy char and roasted qualities wear on me over the course , and i find the drinkability hindered . i thought there would be a bit more sweetness balancing this one out , but i find it lacking . it 's a good beer anyways . away from the norm a tad , and there 's nothing wrong with that ."

S"a : muddy brown with a lively , bubbly head . good retention . s : pumpernickel bread , spice , and dark roasted grain . not as strong as expected t : lots going on here . spice with a light sour note from the rye , very pleasant . brown ale flavors of toasted nuts and grain along with a bit of tootsie roll and light fruitiness . m : smooth , with a prickle of carbonation to balance but with nice small bubbles . d : had this with lightly spicy food and complimented well , though could n't see doing it on its own . small markdown as it loses complexity as you go ."

S"had on-cask at hamilton 's . brown like you would expect , with no head . smells faintly of malt , caramel , and nuts . taste is all about caramel and nuts . excellent flavors . mouthfeel is wonderful and creamy . this beer seems to really benefit from being served from a cask , as i 've also had it on-tap and it was n't quite as good . the other great aspect of this beer is the drinkability factor . it 's low in alcohol and goes down incredibly easy . definitely something you could drink all night ."

S'a : pours perfect grainy , cloudy , yet average amber . looks like burnt straw in the summer sky in late may , just before being harvested under the sun . s : citrus-like and spicy , the aroma of this one hits like a buffalo wing . the heat in the nose perfectly balances the spicy and hoppy tones . the hops smell like west coast varieties , contributing a fruitiness with a slight but weak resemblance to grapefruit . the sweet honey malts are hidden deep within the odor and are difficult to detect amidst the hops and peppers . t : this beer hits the tongue with strong honey flavor and then washes around the tongue , leaving behind fire as it swirls down towards the back of the tongue , exciting the saliva glands . some fruitiness is present , but it is completely dominated by the smoked pepper flavors . it somehow tastes like eating a can of green chilies that have been rolled in fireplace ashes . smoky , spicy character dominates the palette . m : the mouthfeel is very light , with the slightest bit of puckering astringency at the end . d : low to medium , although the amount of heat in the beer might be limiting . overall , the peppers hit a completely different region of the senses than the beer itself , which is unfortunate , as i wanted them to blend more amicably , the way coffee flavors sneak into a beer . this , and the overly cloying sweet taste of the beer are its only faults .'

S"i feel as though i like this beer a little bit more than a beer snob `` should . '' this is simply a very refreshing summer beer and it makes me want to sit out in the middle of a beautiful field and get sauced . i think i would mow my lawn twice over just to drink this beer after . the appearance is a beautiful honey brown that calls my name and says `` drink me . '' it did not have to twist my arm much . there are n't a lot of strong flavors for a pale ale , but i think that 's what they were going for . this stuff goes down like silk and has a very nice but subtle after taste . to me this beer rivals circus boy and becks as one of the best refreshing summer beers ."

S"review is based on serving type : nitro-bottle ( us ) an embarrassment to the true guinness draught experience . nitro-bottle should be discontinued . the nitro-can does a satisfactory job in replicating the keg-draught version of the beer found is bars . the nitro-bottle does not . resembles guinness extra stout much more than daught : appearance : looks identical to guinness extra stout when poured into a sam adams glass . head is brown with large standard beer co2 bubbles , nothing like nitrogen draught white frothy head smell : subtle taste : smooth ... but watery and unpronounced compared to bar version mouthfeel : worst part of experience . the nitrogen feel of the guinness draught ( creaminess ) is absent . resembles a flat `` light beer '' stout feel . again , i am a fan of guinness draught but the nitro-bottle does not work . gimick . buy in nitro-can or only allow it to be a special treat at the bar ."

S"appearance : beautiful deep golden/amber pour with moderately firm light-tan foam . foam seems reasonably durable and laces out , leaving some nice remnants on the glass . a gorgeous looking pour in all regards . aroma : malty , bready , and yeasty aroma . slight , and i do mean slight , hint of hops in the aroma . quite a nice aroma , although it is not super strong . taste : nice malty opening , although it is fairly subtle . bitterness follows , and the aftertaste to me creates a bitter bight on the back of the throat . slight alcohol warming also follows . not a bad octoberfest , but not my favorite . mouthfeel : apart from the aftertaste bite that i detected , this beer feels smooth and not at all watery . mild surviving carbonation . drinkability : while this is not a bad beer , i do n't find myself wanting another one like i have with some other 'fest beers . i find the aftertaste too bothersome for me to score this well . this is a tough review for me . i wish this beer tasted more like the aroma indicated it might ... the aftertaste from this beer is not something that i care for . i 'm not a big fan of an alcohol taste to my beer , either , and this beer has more than i 'd like - especially for the style ."

S'a : poured a caramel brown with yellow highlights that had a finger of head but had good retention and left great sticky lacing on the glass . s : it was big on the malts with various grain aromas but had hints of spice , citrus , and really no hop presence even after taking some deep whiffs to try to find hop characters . t : there was actually some mild hop bitterness on the taste but was overshadowed by the malts and grains . it had a slight banana , citrus , and spice flavors as well . m : light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a very slight sweet , grainy , crisp and very mild hop bitter finish . d : it drinks exceptional due to the lightness of the beer but overall kind of lacked in the flavor and hop punch department .'

S'pours a crystal clear golden copper with an extra pale cream colored two and a half finger head . good retention and patchy lacing . two-row and vegetal/squash aromas , with cinnamon , allspice and a hint of ginger in the background . plain pale malt and husky flavors upfront , followed by a distant pumpkin core taste . the aftertaste is drying , with cinnamon , allspice and ginger slowly emerging bringing a about a faint woody hop flavor and bitterness . i like a more residual sweet and toasty malt profile in my pumpkin beers ; but this leans heavily towards crisp and dry . the body is a thinnish-medium with a mid to high carbonation that further lightens the mouthfeel . finish shows mellow pumpkin pie spices and faintly perceivable pumpkin flesh and pale malt . this is a softer and more approachable pumpkin ale than average and may seem unbalanced to someone looking for a malty ale with lots of pumpkin character . but it may also appeal to someone that desire a beer with just a pumpkin & spice accent that holds a high drinkability .'

S"my first bottle of curieux was like a first date or something . too many great things going on all at once to really stop and take try to explain it . my second bottle was so bad that i swore off buying it again . i 'm hopeful that the third time is a charm . [ bottled in feb. 2005 ] poured into a xlarge tulip with deep murky golden color , also with some brown tones . the head was ridiculously huge . but after the fight i had with the cork , it does n't surprise me.. where 's that saber when you need it ? the nose has some soft bourbon aromas in it , somewhere between the previous two i tasted in strength . oakiness stands out in the smell.. a bit musky , but i love that in its proper dose . all the various ingredients come together in a doughy-bourbon medley that works well . first sip , whew ! starts with straight bourbon flavor , bold enough for a bourbon fan - interesting enough character to outshine the other bourbon aged ales . then a sweet , lightly toasted malt taste.. there 's also a light estery , cherryish sweetness helping to make it much more palatable . this is no wimpy ale ! it 's a very warming brew , with alot of alcohol at the end . the head just keeps going , with bubbly still feeding it . it adds a creamy mouthfeel to an already very smooth , easy drinking brew . what can i say , i 'm floored all over again ! my thanks to nick at bauer wine for mentioning that this ale still tastes great and kicks ass . i would be drinking alot less great beer without your suggestions bro ."

S"pours dense and thick , with a hint of purplish-brown around the edges . head is a lovely caramel brown , thick and aromatic . lots of scents ; earth , wood , butter , sourdough ; very complex but in a nice `` am i getting in over my head '' way . very addicting aroma . taste and mouth feel : this is what real porters should taste like . thick and rich , dense , incredibly dark and complex . it 'll warm you all the way down . overall a spectacular dark beer , and i have n't found anything quite like it . if you like porters give this a try - it seems to be distributed at least around the east cost of the states . i have n't felt the need to drink any other beers since i discovered this stuff - in fact i only buy other brands to distract guests from the zywiec . : ) it 's way too dense and dark for most normal bud-and-coors people , but the few friends who have tried it and liked it ca n't get enough . the high alcohol content is actually a mixed blessing - i could easily drink this stuff all night if i were n't plastered after two bottles . it 's absolutely worth a try ."

S"*1999 vintage drunk march 2007 this seriously old crustacean was lovingly decanted by our waiter from an old-school 7oz bottle into a brandy snifter at gramercy tavern in new york . the bottle was a twist-off , oddly enough . the pour generated absolutely no head . in truth , this beer was flat . but that 's ok , because in this case i 'm not sure carbonation would have added much to the experience . the trick is to think of this as more an after-dinner liqueur than a beer . once you get your head around that , you 'll do fine . the old crusty itself is a hazy , opaque , burnt-amber color . the smell is quite deep ; huge ancient malt aroma buries nearly everything in its path . rough caramel notes , some significant alcohol harshness , and brown sugar show up . possibly some licorice ; and there 's certainly more than a hint of oxidation going on here . a pity , but it does n't overwhelm the beer . the flavor is n't much of a surprise - loads of rich , mildly oxidized malt , sinister alcohol , singed caramel , and muted but still bitter grapefruit hops all come forth and coat my mouth . it 's all blended quite well after 8 years . rather reminiscent of an aged old foghorn , but maltier and without the harsh alcohol bite in the flavor . mouthfeel is again flat , but slick and syrupy and coating . a sipper to be sure , it took me over a half hour to finish my little glass . i was incredibly impressed at every aspect of gramercy tavern , but that 's another review entirely . this beer was a fine end to a superb dinner , and one that i savored - who knows where i 'll get another one of these ? huge thanks to kevin garry for acquiring this rarity . it was one of the better beer `` experiences '' i 've had . *1995 vintage drunk march 2008 lucky to try this from the puny bottle my buddy jim dug out of his cellar . looks the same and smells the same as my previous review . flat . very oxidized , think drinking sherry out of a cardboard box . sweet , ancient . more academic than anything else , i 'm afraid it 's past the prime of life . still a fine example of an aged beer ."

S"my first encounter with a bragot - appears there is n't much in the way of variety of this beer being brewed these days . heck , i 'd never even heard of it . neither my wife nor i can recall where or why this ended up in the fridge . looks like honey , smells like honey , very sweet , almost no head in either pour out of a 22 oz . bomber . taste is sweet but funky . no bite at all , & dead flat , practicaly zero carbonation . there 's a lingering aftertaste of licking a goat that does n't agree with my palate . strange since the up-front taste is almost sickly , mike hard-type sweet . mouthfeel is ok , drinkability drops as i go down the glass . the sweetness is too much to drink more than one , & the unpleasant aftertaste worsens with every sip . i may need a bell 's expedition stout to wash the heliocentric out of my mouth . this is my second taste of two brothers & i have to say i 'm distinctly unimpressed . no urge to try another ."

S"# 52 . my first stone brew review . poured from a bomber to a glass mug at room temp . ( appearance ) pours a fizzy two finger depth tannish head that retains nicely , leaving a big excess foam in the center for a while and some light foamy lacing streaks at the sides . color is a near black with some deep mahogany tones on the edges when held to light . ca n't see any carbonation going on in this brew . it looks like an inviting and bold porter . 4.5 ( smell ) i can certainly get the smoky aroma which lingers over the entire porter smell . some slight chocolate tones and a hint of caramel here and there , a bigger presence on the roasted nuts than the average porter . licorice stands out a lot also . floral hops do a nice job rounding out this nose . biggest fallback is on the potency , where these flavors do n't really get a chance to shine like they should . everything smells really good and i ca n't wait to try this beer . 4 ( taste ) super smoky caramel , this would pair nicely with most smoked foods . a coffee bean taste is more evident than ever , with the roasted bean tones dragging on to the finish paired with a dominant licorice stick twang and some herbal spice zest . plums and dark fruit may also be involved in here , more likely in the finish . a very bold and exciting taste . everything is well rounded and exciting . smokey tastes are most dominant , of course . 4.5 ( mouthfeel ) smooth and creamy . a very smokey mouthfeel that becomes very dominant over time and perhaps too much for some . there could be more carbonation , but i do n't feel it would be appropriate for the style . this does a pretty good job on the mouthfeel . 4 ( drinkability ) a slow drinker due to the complex arrangement of flavors and a smoky dominance but nothing too much for my preference . does well on most levels , but is largely filling and i could n't consider a second bomber after this one . one is all i 'd ever need ! 3 verdict : a worthy porter . smokey accents are well recognized and the taste is well rounded and robust with flavor . porter lover ? worth it ! a- ( 4.2 )"

S"just picked up 12 bombers from bella vista bev in phila . the resident beer geek ( very friendly and knowledgeable guy ... did n't get his name ) is a big fan of voodoo and had me sold on this . he warned about the extreme carbonation , saying it is intended to hold the flavors together . 220z bomber , purchased 2/18/08 , no bottling date , but i assume this is the 'winter ' season . a : i pop the cap , only half expecting the overflow which ocurs almost immediately after i hear the bold hiss . luckily i was near the sink . i too hastily pour into the pint glass , producing an entire glass of foam . realized then that i needed to heed expert 's advice and let this settle for at least a few minutes . after about 5 min i try again ... the head is a humongous white mess that resembles the ocean froth that deposits on the beach when a large buildup of fishey oils is skimmed . large and bountiful oily bubbles . i think this is a compliment , it 's quite a sight , but also is a little bit of a challenge ... s : warm and drawn out ... not bitter or pungent ... more of a focus on the floral tones , but enough piney hop to please . the caramel is an equal player . a well rounded nose . t : i admit , i have been distracted by this head.. pouring a smaller glass than average only to deal with a half glass of foam . but on the other hand , its doing its job . this beer tastes extremely fresh , and well put together . this is a complex beer . the burnt caramel is right up front , very nice . a soft balanced middle , piney earthy and bitter in the back . not a hop bomb , but instead a very well held together complex of tastes . very raw towards the back.. i 'm tasting the ore of the earth . a little warming alcohol and more pine in the aftertaste , both are sitting in my throat , just what i was looking for . mf : a little sticky and oily , this brew is in no hurry to get down my throat , even with all the carbonation . i feel like i 'm drinking a dipa in this sense . d : super enjoyable , except for that pesky head . after allowing the head to settle , i am very happy to have my hands on 12 of these . as i said , a dramatic experience overall ."

S"i was n't going to review this but i decided to anyways because i drink it a lot . this is my choice for cheap quick-fix macro beers . a- watery . if sparkling water was sold in piss hues this is what it would look like . typical cheap beer look , a little more color than most though . no head at all even when poured with drunken fervor - maybe a pinky finger that lingers for about 2 blinks . lacing ? forget about it . does n't exist . s- what smell ? contaminated water ? sewage ? forest runoff ? t- water . a tiny bit of beer flavoring added for effect . m- avian comes to mind . at least it is sparkling water . no lingering taste , no taste at the start either . virtually tasteless . unable to rate due to the lack thereof . d- extremely . because it is like water , since it does n't taste bad ... or good for that matter . i can easily put down a 12er in a few hours and not feel bloated , and i do n't get a headache from it . i reviewed it for this reason . after a few good beers this is the perfect filler before the night cap of an exceptional beer to leave my taste buds with a pleasant memory while carrying a healthy buzz and not spending 100 bucks for it . considering the market for this beer , i think that at least it is the best of the american macro light beers . if i want a light beer , this is what i buy . at $ 10.99 for a 20 pack ( bottles ) and $ 12.99 for a 30 ( cans ) it is a real bargain so i reviewed it . not a beer to impress your business contacts with but great for just getting shitty before bed ! i originally rated this lower but revised it due to the genre it is in . i would n't even place it at all if taking into account the best i have ever had as the benchmark . keeping that in mind , it rates about a 2.5-3.0 overall among macro lights . if i would ever rate anything below a 2 in any category i would n't waste my time ."

S'the colour is deep copper red , the foam is medium-sized and medium-compact . the smells got a distinctive tone of rye crisp bread ( ! ) . there is also a touch of some hops that i couldnt really identify . the carbonation is rather strong . the taste is loaded with lots of rye crisp bread : i could almost identify the ham and cheese , a friend told me at the testing . there is a fine bitterness and a good body , but the aftertaste is quite simple and short . this is a very strange ( but not ugly ) brew . i had to ask the bartender twice to be certain that it wasnt defect in some way .'

S"definitely a disappointment after their last sour i tasted . this one pours a hazy burnt rose with a nice couple fingers of head and solid lacing and nice retention . aroma is powerfully medicinal . hints of the fruit ( currants and cranberries ) sneak through , along with a beguiling smokiness . on the palate there 's a good beer somewhere in here ... it 's just buried too deep . it 's relatively blank up front , the carbonation is high , giving a prickly , metallic flavor and taste . fruit flavors are secondary and only sneak in around the fringe in the back palate . they 're nice , and i wish they were forward . this snaps off abruptly with an exceedingly dry touch . it 's too clean of fruit flavors , and too heavy with off flavors . it 's not horrendous , but it 's not good . and i could , perhaps , be being kind . maybe it is horrendous ."

S'poured into a barrel mug . pours a clear brown coming out but is a solid black in the mug . a nice finger of slightly off white head that disappears quickly and leaves spotty stringy lacing . smell is pretty subtle . but what is there is nice and roasty . no heat from the alchohol . some sweetness that reminds me of a caramel or a molasses . im liking the taste more than the smell . not too sweet , but malty and roasty nonetheless . a tad bit of the alchohol comes through in the aftertaste but it doesnt overwhelm . fairly typical of the bock style . mouthfeel : sticky . not as sticky as some doppelbocks but still just sticky . affordable . with a well masked high abv . decent tasting . fits almost all requirements for one of those nights where you just wan na feel alchohol but not punish yourself with a bad beer .'

S"appearance : pours just like the adverts . looks beautiful . fluffy white head compliments the golden body . lacing down the glass with effervescent wondertude . smell : i smell pilsner malt , slight alcohol . taste : delicate taste . slight fruit . good malt backbone . i just finished a glass of duvel prior to this ( not fair i know ) and this tastes a bit watery . i 'm sure this is to style , however . slightly spicy yeast flavor . mouthfeel : good carbonation level leaves a full feeling on the tongue . as jim carey once said , `` i like it a lot . '' drinkable : yes . i likes it . edit : as the beer warms it gets slightly syrupy . more of a sipping beer , really . a little too sweet unless the beer is colder ."

S'poured this 500 ml brown bottle into a pils glass . best before date notched 6 10 . there was a whispy pop when i opened the swingtop . a vigorous pour resulted in a moderate head of white foam . a cap remained throughout and left light lacing . golden body was typical . smell was sweet lemons . a tiny bit funky as it warmed , i assume this is the nobel hops aromas . taste was bright hops and gentle bitterness . moderately grainy and richer than expected . solid . mouthfeel was smooth with minimal carbonation . i would gladly drink this one again .'

S"the duchesse pours a transparent burnt copper with a firm head of light brown foam , it leaves some spotty lacing . the nose is sour and reminds me of spoiled tomatoes , not completely rotten , but close . this flanders starts off sweet and reminds me of apple cider or apple butter , with some sour tartness and subtle spice . midway i pickup some aged barrel flavorings and vinegar , still reminds me of salad dressing in a way . the end is tomato ketchup like and for me keeps the score down a half point . i enjoy this offering three fourths of the way through but the finish keeps me from wanting much more . medium bodied with quite a lot of carbonation , and a slick feel . i had the duchesse a while back and i 'm almost sure it was rotten , i could n't even finish it and scored it an f. the duchesse de bourgogne has proven to be a very complex woman that i 'm still trying to figure out completely ."

S"this was probably the most aesthetically pleasing beer i have ever seen . i poured the whole 12 oz . bottle into a mug ( i know , kind of ridiculous to drink a beer like this in a mug ) . i probably should have shared it with someone . it poured beautifully , deep dark crimson , with a thick off-white head that could n't possibly be stopped . as soon as i smelled it i went `` whoa ! '' this was my first abbey ale , and i 'm still kind of getting used to belgian-style ales . it smelled strong and fruitlike . the taste is something like i 've never quite imagined in a beer . it tastes like figs , plums , and caramel - and i guess it sort of tastes like beer . and i mean , even if you are n't a connoisseur and have n't learned to do formal tastings or anything , you will notice these flavors in this beer . the high abv is definitely apparent in the flavor . it 's a beer that i 'm glad i tried and think back going `` wow , that was some brew , '' but could never finish an entire 12 ounces of it . i did n't finish that mug , but was amazed to see that the thick creamy head lingered on the beer the entire time - and it was in the mug for well over an hour ! if you 're feeling bold and adventurous ( or just happen to like very sweet , fruity , dark belgian ales ) , give it a go !"

S"when i bought this on my latest trip to amsterdam , i thought it might be a wonderful surprise . then i read the ba reviews and the fear began to build . unfortunately , the reviewers were correct . this is not much of a beer . most notable feature is the hot alcohol burn . it reminds me of a steel reserve with some added sugar . color is a clear gold with a very thin white head . smells very sugary , almost like grape juice . not much in the way of hop bitterness or flavor . mostly heavy sugar and malt with a lot of alcohol taste . not a very pleasing drink . i ca n't tell what the grolsch brewers were trying to do but this beer did n't turn out so well ."

S"pours out to a clear dark-brown with rich ruby highlights , forming a modest dark beige head with poor retention and minimal lacing . the head settles down quickly , but leaves a thin layer of clumpy bubbles which linger . the carbonation is mild to moderate . aroma is predominatly malty , with some roasted malt , vanilla , esters akin to a common brown , tobacco , and caramelized sugar . mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body . taste begins with initial zing of carbonation , a brief wave of alcohol , a herbal hoppiness , nuts , amber malts , grain husk , brief metal , and finishes with more toast and a light roasted grain astringency , in that order . probably my least favorite of styles , this brew is simple , straighforward , and dull . this style has always seemed like a crossover between domestic swill and real craft beer ... kinda like the stuff your friends drank in college to be sophisticated . ( e.g-heiny dark , leiny , or st.pauli girl dark ) . not bad , but something i 'm thoroughly not interested in ever drinking again ."

S"thanks to hopflop for this one ! served from bottle into a duvel tulip . poured a nice hazy dark copper with a small amount of sediment settling at the bottom with an off-white two-finger head that subsides to a one-finger after a bit . the lacing was excellent throughout . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , subtle hops , and small amount of alcohol . the flavor was of loads of sweet malt , alcohol , and a hoppy followthrough . it had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation . overall this was a very flavorful brew . it had a nice balance of sweet of bitter to counteract the alcohol flavor so it was n't overpowering . however it is not that drinkable though and you can definitely tell it is a heavy hitter ."

S"this brew costs about $ 16.00 out the door for 30 cans . so , it is exceptionally inexpensive . the rumor is these guys found the old 1960 's old style recipe in an old file cabinet at the lacrosse brewery . this is therefore supposed to be the authentic `` old '' old style in all but name . this is an very good beer for the price . it is light but has flavor , and is an excellent thirst quenching beer when you drink it really cold . the flavors are of slightly bitter grain , with an `` almost sometimes '' cross between banana and citrus poking its way through . hops are light and not too noticeable . i can see where it might be a bit watery , but you do n't buy this stuff expecting something that 's not a bit light on ingredients . hey , what they do with whatever goes into this beer for & gt ; $ .50 a can is not to be scoffed at . this is way better than milwaukee 's best , stroh 's or any other lowest of the bottom shelf brands . buy this stuff and drink a lot of it - your wallet will thank you and you wo n't sacrifice much quality over big brand macro-brews . of the cheap beers , this and pbr are my top two of all time ."

S'a good , drinkable amber ale . it has a smooth , mellow mouthfeel with enough moderate carbonation to keep the beer from becoming heavy on the palate . it has the style named color and is a bit on the darker side of amber and has a decent head that disperses evenly . the aroma is very light with only a bit of toasty malt . i would say if there was a single weak point on this beer it is in the aroma . the beer is a straightforward but flavorful blend of nutty , just slightly hopped and bright , toasted and grain-sweet malts . the most upstanding component is a mild nuttiness kind of like toasted chestnut . it is a pleasant tasting beer that could easily be drunk on its own , or eaten with mild and earthy foods . a good solid drinking beer that exemplifies the style .'

S'so much about this beer is in the fashion it is served . never , ever , ever drink this beer out of a can or bottle . the only way to drink guinness as it is intended is on-top and poured in two parts . it might seem trivial to some , but is as factual a statement as i can make . i sat at a think wooden bar where jason pulled 2/3 of my pint glass and let the nitrogen go to work . after the 2/3 had settled he slowly pulled the last third and presented me with a beautiful libation . the dark stout is complemented perfectly with a smooth , buttery head . the head of the guinness is what sets it apart , for me , from any other beer . the head is creamy as opposed to airy and rests wonderfully on my top lip as i bring the pint to my mouth . i draw my head back and open up the back of my throat . this is where the real taste of a guinness comes in to play . smooth , slightly bitter and creamy . perfectly wonderful . for some the taste can be too mild , almost watery when compared to more hoppy beers . and i agree . but the freshness of a guinness is what appeals to me . the glass is laced to perfection and i ask jason to start me another . for me , when enjoyed properly , guinness is the master of beers .'

S"bottle from 2008 i poured this baby fairly aggressively into a pint glass in hopes of some substantial head . no dice ! i got a thin layer of dark molasses colored head atop a pitch blach fluid . almost no light gets through this bad boy . a teensy bit can be seen at the very edges . a thin ring of lacing persists most of the way down the glass as i drink . with a slight tilt of the glass , you can see , the beer definitely `` has legs '' . i poured the glass about a foot from my nose , however , i easily had a whiff of the powerful bourbon aroma . upon closer sniffing , i can ascertain the smell as a somewhat dry bourbon smell with hints of toasted malts , sweet molasses , and cinammon . a sip reveals a massive palette of bourbon chocolate candy ! holy cow ! ! it has been a while since i last had this . by nights end i may end up raiding my stash of yesteryear gibcs ... but i digress . man , that is a big flavor . the alcohol is very present but not overbearing . it has a nice warming quality for these cold nights . bourbon is definitely at the forefront , but i would n't say the beer is unbalanced , just boozy . drinkability ... .hmmmm ... .ask yourself , do you like fizzy yellow beer even in winter ? if yes , this may not be for you . this beer is n't messing around . for the `` full-flavor '' types out there , it is certainly drinkable !"

S"one day i had bought a cigar and i needed a place to smoke it before it went bad . i decided since it was a sumatra cigar i should drink sumatra coffee with it . i ended up having to go to starbucks to fulfill this . the clerk was outside and he told me about this saying it was 'the best beer . ' i decided to put this turtleneck-wearing yuppy 's opinion to the test . 10.59 at a discount tobacco outlet . poured black with a tinge of red hues . the bubbles were strange in the fact they were big and brown but disipated instantly . kinda a wierd head almost like malt liqour . smell is like chocolate syrup and a very faint scent of instant coffee ( still good though . ) taste was shocking . burnt malts or hops . i 'm not sure . i guess malts because it is a stout afterall . the burnt thing is really active here more than anything i 've ever tasted . i mean we 're talking smokey espresso . i had bought a irish cream stout before , and to my surprise it was n't too good . this had almost the same saddening effect . the burnt bitter taste is super lingery . you only taste the sweet milkiness when you sip it . there is a bit of instant coffee taste to it a bit . the mouthfeel is a bit sticky . it is also pretty drinkable . i mean for a stout it 's probably a bit thinner than most - it 's between a porter and a stout i think . i 'm puzzled with this beer . it 's neat cause it 's different . i 'll say that , but i mean this guy totally did n't know what he was talking about i think course we live in a minimal good brew area for the most part until recent two months . i must say though if you like coffee you would probably like this . i 'm not sure but my guess is that since it tastes like coffee quite a bit more than most coffee hinted brews and this guy who is a barista loved the hell outta it - i 'd say it would probably work . i 'm going to say i 'm not buying it again cause i 'm not paying 10 bucks for something this ok . i 'm sure it 's someone else 's thing though ."

S'this beer is brewed in friesland , which is the northern part of the netherlands and a province where things are being done a little different than in the rest of the country . and so is this beer ... appearance is a clear , brown beer with a small head with some bigger bubbles . only a small number of gas bubbles reach for the top . smell is super intreging , what is this ? definatelly vanilla and pipe tobacco , something woody and rich and sweet like a christmas pudding . taste is vanilla , christmas pudding , caramel , which really reminds me of pipe tobacco . there is also something oaky in here and a little marmelade . bitterness and maltbitterness comes out after some sips . mouthfeel is sticky and sweet , smooth . balance is very good , with the sweetness and bitter soaked in creamy vanilla .'

S"poured a thin translucent yellow , big white head , bubbly , already disappointed by the dillluted color and the false promise of `` best beer ever '' on the label . smelled of slightly sour hops , corked beer so it may have gone bad . taste was light and slightly sour . satisfying carbonation , evanescent and light on the palate . quaffable with a light nose , but ultimately unsatisfying for the price"

S"just reading the term `` belgian ipa '' provides a great feeling . a great history of brewing that has set the bar for the rest of the world is taking note of the ( primarily ) west coast usa brewing styles . on paper it should be a dream pairing . i had a hard time with belgian beers that advertise themselves as 'hoppy ' and that 's primarily due to what 's available in the local market . we have floral , resiny , grassy , bitter , turbo , you name it as far as hops go . add to this mix belgian yeast and brewing techniques and that criteria is sort of thrown out the window . my first taste of this beer was a mistake , i compared it too much to the west coast ipa under the assumption that anything we can do they can do better . that was a big mistake . my thinking was that too much hopping would diminish the complexities of the belgian yeast . this can be true in some beers . not in this one . this one nails it to produce an excellent beer . it took a few years , but i 'm hooked !"

S"had this brew served in a brandy snifter . the color was very dark brown and no light made it through . the initial aroma was one of maltiness and a sweet smell almost like molasses . there was no head evident but this could be in part due to the snifter being filled completely . more beer for me ! the first sip revealed similar flavors to the aromas . sweet maltiness , with very little hop charcter present . the brew finishes very cleanly and leaves little taste in my mouth . definitely no hint of alcohol flavors here . the beer was a little thin for a barleywine in my opinion and actually was a little bit mild for me as well . but the existing flavors were yummy and the beer was very drinkable . just wish it had a little more `` umph ! ''"

S"pours a very dark brown , almost black , with a finger of tan head . the head does n't last too long but leaves some pretty layers of lacing . when held to the light , you can see brown highlights and excellent clarity . when tilted , it leaves a nice brown stain on the glass . the aroma is firstly of strong wort , like dme and dark hopped lme mixed . there 's also some hints of orange peel , a good bit of roasted grains , some brown sugar , strong alcohol , a bit of dark earthy hopping , and also a good hint of vanilla extract in the back . the flavor tends to follow the aroma ... a ton of malt that 's almost molasses like , a good roasted grain character ( black patent ) , toffee , walnuts , and burnt pecan pie . the finish lingers a while with very sweet malt , dark roasted grain , earthy hops , and a good bit of alcohol . the beer has an almost barleywine-like sweetness and hopping , but has the roasted grain notes of a robust porter . the mouthfeel department is a syrupy affair with medium-low carbonation and some chewiness , along with an oily yet very dry and warming finish . this beer is simply overwhelming . it 's just too much to want to drink a lot of . the flavor is original and unique , complexc and interesting , but just a bit too strong . definitely a must try ."

S"i found bottles of this and grabbed two immediately not quite realizing what it was it was supposed to be . i only had heard vaguely that this was somewhat rare . i read on the bottle that it was made with maple syrup . sounded interesting . then i got home and read the ba reviews . i advise reading through them before you taste . i did n't realize the potency and the aging potential of this beer before then . my bottles are 1997 i think so i do n't know how they were handled before 2002 . i poured this into a shot glass after reading the reviews . no pint glass , no tulip glass . 2oz . to start with . looks very black and opaque . no head . smells like soy sauce . take in eye dropper size sips . first taste reminds me of smokey links with maple syrup . sweet tasting . sugary maple . i detect a smokey like taste too . i do n't think the ratings are very useful here . it is an extreme experience that could easily rate 2 or 5 . given an expectation of small doses i think an experience ba will look forward to the experience as an occasion . if i were smart i would have saved this for the 100th review like the previous reviewer ."

S"12 oz bottle poured into a dfh signature glass westmalle dubbel poured dark brown with lighter browns and reds when held to the light . massive cream colored 3f head that settled into craterous 2f cap . the head on this beer did n't want to go away and left massive lacing all around the glass . the nose sports sweet malts , pepper , hints of clove , and floral hops . the carbonation comes in full force at first sip then gives way to a fruity center ( prunes ? ) . the ending brings a hint of bitter floral hops with a dry finish . this brew comes off a bit light and watery , sports good carbonation and leaves a bit of metallic after taste . good if not simple flavors combined with lighter makes this beer quite drinkable for the style ."

S"appearance - poured a wonderful nut brown , with a *massive* head that took forever to fade . had to pour half a glass at a time , as the other half of the glass would just be foam for ages . smell - hints of citrus , and mostly a dark malt , and roasted nuts . taste - man , this is a complex brew . when it 's colder , you get mostly malts and a hint of roasted nuts and dark fruit . as it warms , a sense of raisins/dates comes to the front , and the nuts take on complexity . extremely tasty , and very rich . mouthfeel - this is definitely an unfiltered beer . you can feel the thickness of it as you drink , lots of malts have gone into creating the effect . a pleasure to drink , but so rich you have to take your time . drinkability - as wonderful as this beer is , i challenege you to finish a bottle in an hour . it took two of us the entire length of a movie to finish a half bottle each . it 's just *so* rich and thick that one glass feels like two to your stomach . unfortunately , i had to dock it for that , but otherwise this beer is fantastic ."

S"i 'm not sure why nsa got classified as a hefeweizen . according to a heineken press release , the malts are optic and golden promise . no wheat mentioned at all . the hefe is also missing , there being not one suggestion of sediment in the bottle . upon tasting it , i would classify it as a british summer ale . what i did get from the tasting was a pleasant surprise . whereas there is litte hop presence in nba there is plenty here , as promised by the information on the packaging . a spicy fuggles element really comes through . mouthfeel is substantial and the higher hopping level does n't affect the strong malt elements here . for nba they do add corn grits as the adjunct and i suspect some here also ( it is alot less noticable in nsa ) . the ale finshes with a crisp hop finish . at the end of the day , this ends up being a good quality bitter ."

S'poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass : really has this burnt orange color to it that is hazy nad has a tiny head . little retention and no lacing evident . smell is very muted , has a lemony bitter aroma if anything . taste is ok , not a belgian ipa by any means . probably infected as its tart as all hell and has a bitter lemon/raspberry flavor to it . refreshing in this hot weather , but not a belgian ipa to me by any standards . carbonation is nice though there is no head retention . drinkability for me is high on a day like this becuase its so refreshing but not worth seeking out to great lengths at all .'

S"a - a deep slightly hazy amber with light tan head that leaves a sheet of lace clinging to the snifter as it descends . s - a massive piney ambrosia of citrus hops here . tangerine/pineapple/grapefruit join up with a pine needle aroma . the essence of a great malty , fruity foundation is apparent in the nose . m - quite mellow as far as bitterness goes at first , nice spice at the finish reminiscent of poblano pepper . thick and full bodied with plenty of sweetness that keeps the abundance of hops and a warming booziness at bay . t - intense hoppy joy is the focus here . a nice deep warming flavor of malt and candied golden raisins with a sweet vinous touch . heights of citurs and herbal hop flavors relax when a spicy peppery bite joins the peachy currant and golden raspberry yeasty taste . nutty qualities as well as dates are detected in the pastiche of this big ipa . d - not necessarily the best , but very well one of the most complex imperial ipa 's i have tasted . a spectrum of sweet , fruity , spicy , bitter , juicy and heat as it shows its strength . a force to be reckoned with , hercules does n't play games with your palate . it 's straight forward demanding behemoth threat takes no prisoners . this is a bruiser -take heed ."

S"a- well lets do this ! pours a muddied brown color with a cappuccino colored head that is n't exactly thick ... .it actually is quite noisy and fizzles quickly into a thin layer with a ring around the glass . the brew looks reasonably still and lacing is virtually non existant , but then from what i 've read up on this one , this is n't unexpected . s- whoa , this is definitely sour ! sour fruits dominate here ... .cherries , raspberry , apples right away , followed by some dry earthiness , and possibly a bit of wood . the beginning shows just a hint of sweet fruit but then it 's nothing but a sour bomb through and through . t- very much the same as the aroma but amplified times 10 ! lots of candied sour fruit with just a hint of sweetness on the finish to keep me coming back for more . there is an underlying hint of wood and earth as well but it 's very well hidden . m- medium/lite bodied , and with minimal carbonation . the sourness coats the palate and especially the side of the tongue where the sour sensors are ! there is a lingering flavor afterwards that inclines me to have another sip of mouth puckering goodness . o- this is the first sour beer i 've ever had so i have nothing to compare it to . my first taste was hard to handle , but just like sour soother candies , the more you have , the easier it gets to handle ... however it 's too strong for my liking . i 'm good with the one bottle i have and *may* look for this again . i obviously need more experience with this style but it 's definitely in line with what was stated by the brewery !"

S'on tap at stone world bistro and gardens . i thought that this beer was phenomenal - it is probably the best balanced and most complex american style bw i have tried that is this young . it was not identified as to vintage on the menu , but the bartender said it was a 2006 . 8 oz . serving in a snifter-style glass . lovely ruddy appearance -- crystal clear . aroma is deliciously complex . there are notes from malt , hops , and a variety of sweeter alcohols , without overpowering nw hops or harsh alcohols . many of the complexities associated with aged bw are already present - raisin , plum , date and leather aromas are noticeable . no oxidation notes -- sherry or the like . taste follows the aroma . the flavor is rich and complex , with no hint of harshness from high hopping or fusel alcohols . the balance in phenomenal -- neither hops nor malt dominate , and the interaction between them simply brings out the best in each . the malt is rich without being cloying and the hops balance with bitterness and add perfumy and fruity flavors . mouthfeel is very full and creamy . it is rather surprising that this is identified as a 10 abv beer -- the alcohol is noted mainly as flavor and a warmth as is flows down the throat -- there is little heat up front . it is certainly strong , however , but it is sneaky -- it seems less potent than it is because of that superb balance . that makes it very drinkable , but dangerous . very enjoyable -- highly recommended .'

S"i have read much about this fruit bomb , of sorts , and have waited patiently to acquire one . i finally happened to obtain one , and tonight , i drink . i must say , this poured a much different colour than i had anticipated . a cloudy orange with no sediment ( i expected a little ) and a thick , almost glue-like snow white fluffy head that subsided to a thin white haze in about 90 seconds . thick , sticky lacing clings tightly to the sides of the glass . the smell is f~r~u~i~t ! ! ! ... .and little else . surprisingly , at 18 % , there is nearly no alcohol present in the smell . it is also important for me to tell all who read this that i am also consuming / reviewing this at about 41f ( approximately 6c ) , quite cold indeed . i 'm sure as this warms , the smell of alcohol with surley become more evident . the easiest way for me to describe this , would be to dump a framboise lambic and about 2 shots of stolichnaya vodka into a glass . the musty `` dank basement smell '' is there , just like in a lambic or a saison . the raspberry is about all your taste buds get for about half a second ; very pleasant . as the liquid washes over the back of your tongue and you actually swallow it , there is no mistake about it , this stuff is hot ! ! 18 % ? you bet ! ! every bit of it ! ! it is n't unmanagable , especially if you 're expecting it , but it is certainly intense . the mouthfeel is heavy . very heavy . actually ... it 's syrupy . `` it 's a big beer '' , just does n't quite capture it for this one ... because of the abv and unparalleled weight / syrup like body ( for the style ) i gave drinkability a 2.5 . this one 750ml is plenty , and it 'll be quite a daunting task for me to finish this by myself tonight ... i 'm sure i 'll sleep like a log . if you do happen to get the chance to try this one out , go for it . i promise it 's unlike anything you 've likely every had . blessed be -ss"

S"in my family , i am known for my discerning and sage judgment when it comes to beer and all things brewed . it is a reputation that i 'm not comfortable with but i will admit that i can spot a damn good beer when i find one . and while milwaukee 's best ice is not one of these , i have to admit it is pretty damn good . as far as grocery store macro brews go , it is far better than coors/piss , mgd or the supposed king of beers . because when you get down to taste , it is more complex overall than those impostors . a - refreshing look , good head on pour , quickly dissipates in seconds to lacey covering - poor head retention ... golden-straw colored , clear , good carbonation s - very little aroma - lemon-piney aroma soon after poor , gives way to more alcohol smell as beer warms t - i 'm assuming they mean this to be a pilsner ... it 's a piss-poor one but it has it 's own merits to redeem it ... slight bitter aftertaste on upper palatte , citrus notes , particularly lemon , mild hoppyness for pilsner without any bitterness ... overwhelming impression is one of sweet malt flavor , probably from adjuncts which allow it to be a cheap brew m - almost overly carbonated , prickles on tongue and quickly goes flat like head , feels initially clean but leaves a slight feeling of coating on the tongue and upper palette and back part of tongue d - high high high ... this is an infinitely drinkable beer , which has led to it 's frat house appeal . this beer is cheap cheap cheap ... and yet it is interesting enough that it is my cheap beer choice . it 's definitely not consistent or even very good on it 's own , but it is complex enough to satisfy me when i want a high volume , highly drinkable beer ( i.e . a beer to get drunk with ) and honestly , there are worse things in the world than a drinkable , cheap beer ... so raise a glass to the beast ... a special note ... do not drink this from the can ... the only way it is palatable is from a glass ."

S"a tall , corked and caged 75cl glass bottle with the eye of quebec figuring prominently on the label . the bottle comes with a clear `best by` date , though no indication when it was brewed . the packaging is clear and stately . just opening the bottle releases a host of deep , fruit scents . the beer pours as a thin , opaque liquid , about the colour of honey . there 's moderate carbonation that , even in my head-friendly glass , quickly fades to a ring of white . it warms quickly , releasing a thick , spicy odour . the yeast is evident in the scent , as are mildy fruity notes , just barely rising into perception . the beer is peppery and sweet , thin to medium bodied and not syrupy . i has a distinct carbonation when drank , something not apparent from the head , that lends it a moderate bite . the fruit notes get little play in the taste , remaining just off to the side as glance of pear , or whisper apple , it 's difficult to tell which . warmth improves the character of the beer , bringing out the sweetness to compliment the initial exclamation point of allspice . at 9 % abv , a single person could drink all 75cl by ones self , but it 's definitely best shared with a friend on a cold winter night . this is a very good tripel by the good brewers at unibroue ."

S"i first tried yards love stout years ago on my first visit to monk 's cafe in philadelphia . i think i ordered the beer because it was cheap and local . the bartender poured the beer and then put the bottle down in front of me . i read on the label , to my amazement , that this was brewed with oysters ! i had never heard of such a crazy thing before , and i was really pleased with the beer too . ( i swear i thought i could taste something different about the beer ... something fishy ) there was really something about that beer which got me hooked , and i came back for more . then , all of a sudden , it was gone . until about a year ago , that is . i was pretty happy to see it back on the shelf , and i instantly bought a case . however , i find out that it is not brewed with oysters anymore . when i tasted it this time , i found it to be a standard , decent stout , but lacking its original pizazz . after going through the better part of a case , i am over the whole recipe change . this holds up pretty well . poured into a pint glass . no freshness date on the bottle . the bottle reads : `` straight from the heart of the city of brotherly love comes a dark and chocolatey seductive little stout dominated by roasted malt flavor . this is one philly favorite that wo n't break your heart and will always love you back . alc . 4.5 % by vol . '' a : it pours with a medium sized tan head that crackles away slowly but surely , leaving nothing after about a half a glass . the black body looks fine with brown edges , yet this is at best a standard look for this style . the head needed to be thicker and more compact . there was little to no lacing on the glass . s : a fantastic smell ! burnt grains , charcoal and a molasses sweetness are all dominant . there is no hop aroma as far as i can detect . what is there in the background is subtle fruit notes . i first get the smell of dates and figs . then as the beer warms up , banana chips . t : acrid roasted flavor stands out most , supported by a juicy , fruity malt sweetness . there is sweetness up front , and in my opinion , more sweetness than the style calls for . light burnt toast flavor on the exhale . surprisingly , and to the beer 's credit , there is not much that i would characterize as coffee-ish . maybe some milk chocolate flavor , but that is stretching . mostly this beer is dominated"

S"bottle courtesy of gunhaver . poured into a snifter . burnt orange in color , lightening to persimmon when put against strong light . half an inch of white head that dissipates to a ring and leaves no lacing . smell is heavy on the astringent nail polish , with just a little fruitiness . flavor is extremely sweet up front , with grapefruit liqueur and maple syrup . the harsh rubbing alcohol comes out in the finish . mouthfeel is very thick . obviously a sipping beer . carbonation is n't enough to power through the body , but it does n't seem like any amount would . drinkability is obviously terrible ."

S"it 's got a straw-coloured and cloudy appearance , with a decent head on it . it smells nice and hoppy on the nose , but that 's about it . i dove right into the first sip . the hoegaarden has a nice mouthfeel - bubbly , but not overly so , and not too heavy . i liken it to a heavy champagne feel . it was sweet on the swallow , and the aftertaste was the same until about a minute later when it turned bitter . i caught a distinct flavour of fruit , although it was n't orange i have to admit . after the sip , the head dissipated to about 1/8 inch . here 's the kicker : the flavour did n't change after that first sip . i did n't find any improvement or backsliding , and even the head stayed about the same . i took about 20 minutes to drink this beer , and throughout the experience i did n't find any development . this would be fine if hoegaarden was outstanding , but i do n't think it is . i was slightly disappointed - i had hoped it would develop more through the session . this may be an issue of white beers and my own taste , but i finished the beer without being too impressed . i expected more out of it , to be honest . i can only rate it as average for its lack of outright flaws . it 's fine if you 're going to have a few with friends who do n't like anything heavier or more flavourful , but it 's nothing to get too excited over ."

S"andy cracked this one tonight . overall , this has been rough on my emotions . i was really excited , and then incredibly bummed . so andy spent a good spell painstakingly cutting the wax of this one , leaving a crumbing mess on the counter . he then popped the cap and erupts volcano campeador rurik ale ( 2010 ) . there goes , our paper towel supply . andy ran to the sink , gusher in hand , me with two tulips ready for him to slap some black liquid in with a monster of a tan head . so the trouble began . andy then told this one may be infected . i do n't keep track of his beers so this surprised me . i stuck my nose in it and i got a whiff of unwelcome tartness . a couple whiffs more i guess i smells smoke . tart smoke . this sucks . after smelling it for a while i reluctantly put this up to my lips and decided to taste . well , that was n't quite as bad , but still by no means any good . i get a little cocoa which i guessing comes from the hunaphu and that unwelcome tart flavor . tart cocoa . my liver is getting pissed at me because i keep taking sips . mouthfeel is smooth . this would be good drinking if it was n't for the infection . what could have been . . . ."

S"raspberries and booze , that 's what you 'll get out of this one . pours pinkish with a white head . smells like it tastes , like raspberries and alcohol . the taste is dominated by the berry and the very warm alcohol . i was hoping for some more complexity with this one , but that 's about it . surprisingly i found this one easier to drink as i went along , that may have had something to do with the 18 % strength . this one should almost be treated as an aperitif rather then any traditional beer . i 'm glad i tried it , but i do n't i 'd buy it again for the very steep price they are asking for it ."

S"12oz . bottle the appearance is a beautiful , clear golden . good amount of carbonation bubbles rising from everywhere . i got a 2 finger head from a very aggresive pour . but it faded to zero head very fast . this is the first time i have ever poured a bud into a glass so i thought i 'd be generous with the first few words . the smell does n't have much to offer . i 've been on a ipa kick lately so i expected nothing from bud . i 've drank this so many times before but never once smelled it . now that i do smell it i can get that corn/adjunct aroma . maybe it 's just my mind but i do smell that green apple skin . taste is n't much . the more i drink the more corn i taste . i used to drink this shit constantly but now it 's almost a chore . thanks a lot bas now i ca n't even get drunk for cheap . actually i can still choke it down , but it is tough . mouthfeel is almost non-existent which is exactly what bud wants it to be . they did a good job . drinkability is high . that 's what anheuser thrives on is the drinkability . they get high marks for that just cause if you 're drinking bud you 're probably drinking at least a 12-pack . if you 're in school drink it up if it 's free . `` diesel '' is the best you 'll find at most college parties . i had this bud in my fridge . i drank enough of it to give a review and i came to the point that ... . i 'm allergic . i sneezed a good 15 times while trying to write this review . so my final words `` stay away from the swill . it 'll make you sneeze and if it does n't make you sneeze , it just tastes like shit '' . slainte !"

S"pours a slightly hazy light brown colour with a hint of orange copper color . dense off-white head that leaves lots of lacing - perhaps a bit of wheat in there ? smells just as a vienna should - grassy , lots of pils maltiness and just a tiny bit of roasty biscuit character there , topped off by a subtle yet distinct floral hoppiness . surprisingly full 'wet ' body , lots of dextrine or starchiness . lots of bubbles , but only moderate carbonic zing on the tongue . flavour has notable hop bitterness to it , perhaps a bit more than appropriate . on top of that is a very robust malty/grassiness with a dry finish . some caramel toast/biscuit there as well . rounding things out is a faint but noticeable floral hops flavour . my only complaint is the level of hops bittering - almost approaching pilsner levels . still , the clean , dry finish means this is a dangerously drinkeable beer ."

S'rejoice ; midwestern classic microbrewery in need of i2pa finally releases one and goes all the way , releasing it in six-pack damage the head format . the wait for this has been long in the making . i remember drooling over early reviews when it was served on draft at the eccentric caf . this ended up setting me back $ 15 for this sixer , a bit steep when you consider that works out to be about $ 4.50 a bomber . still , this is a big beer that demands your attention , so what are you going to say , no ? the appearance of this is true to type and actually pale , on its way to peach in color . globules and flecks of yeast slurry are all over the pour interesting . calm head that cascades slowly is not a surprise for a ~10 % abv beer . nose is amazing ; the hop synergized . layers of hoppy goodness from pine to grapefruit and back again . the twang of muskmelon . impression of high-test cannabis , a body/sock funk , and a piney-heat . yummy , superfresh . taste is gorgeous and instantly recalls dreadnaught and ruination . peach cream-savers are also dredged up from the memory banks . somewhat dry in character , sweet at times but ends up bittersweet . malt/hop character goes off the trail late into the swallow and on repeat performance . very good , but not great . needs just a little bit more of a bitter punch , especially to hold true to the bottles designation . not necessarily the world-endingly-awesome brew some were hoping for , but close to divine regardless .'

S"sweet mother maria . it 's coming across beers like this that make trying news beers fun . at dyan 's tonight . bottle number 906 of 1188 . the beer pours a tannish , toffee brown color with minimal head retention and lacing . this is the sort of thing i see in beers that have seen some serious barrel aging ( which the label indicates this beer has seen ) . on the nose , this is one of the more exotic aroma profiles i 've ever come across ( i assume the 9 months in whiskey barrels had something to do with that ) . in any event , i get an exotic display of brown sugar , clove , light mint , pine , vanilla and even ginger . it does n't entirely work , but it certainly keeps things interesting ( something i always find fun ) . on the palate , this beer is dominated by milk chocolate and brown sugar , but with some pretty noticeable hoppy bitterness in the finish . however , unlike the regular ruffian , the barrel aging has really mellowed the hoppy bitterness , which imparts barely a kiss of bitterness and alcohol in the finish with this beer . mouthfeel is probably this beer 's best attribute , with the beer showing a soft , sweet , creamy and very long finish . the sweetness in this beer is countered very nicely by the underlying bitterness in this beer , and drinkability is not bad for the abv . ( though it 's clearly there , and does detract just a bit from this beer 's drinkability ) . still , this is very cleary a sizeable , rich , intensely flavored barleywine that would undoubtedly benefit from some considerable cellariing . a very impressive effort from the folks at great divide ."

S"batch 4 # 254/472 . the beer pours into my duvel tulip a nice looking hazy lemon yellow . first pour yields half a finger of head , and the second would , despite an intentionally vigorous pour , result in about a finger and a half . neither cap leaves anything in the way of lacing , or has any staying power , and in this regard the beer is a disappointment . white birch 's pale ale was a bit of a challenge from a reviewing standpoint , as i spent the first third of the beer lamenting that it did n't mesh at all with my preconceived notions of what a bpa should be like , and the rest of the beer thoroughly enjoying it for what it was . the nose has the pear aroma mentioned on the bottle as well as some grassy notes . i do n't find nearly as much pear as i sip though , mostly the same grassy notes with a welcome blast of bitter lemon citrus at the end . there 's also a faint pale malt sweetness running throughout . the beer is wonderfully light , and drinks crisp and dry . it 's not as undercarbonated as the look would have suggested , but it still is slightly so . if i had to guess blind i would say it 's around 5.5 % abv , the nearly 9 % level never makes itself apparent . that combined with the light , dry body makes it incredibly drinkable ."

S'light lager . poured from tap at the brewery about an hour ago into a clean , clear glass . a poor . thin , watery look with a hint of straw color and nearly no head . i am not impressed by the look . s not much of anything . maybe some distant malt . t light , distant grains . not a whole lot more . i know that this is a light beer but really the taste leaves a lot to be desired . m very light ( and true to the style ) . d great drinkability ( that is the point of this beer me thinks ) and just like bud light i will not likely test its drinkability with no further efforts to purchase this beer .'

S"i poured two ounces of this beer , and my entire pint glass was filled with foam . this is the second atwater beer i 've tasted , and both have done this . this is very annoying , and alone would cause me not to buy there beer again . so now , fifteen minutes after i started to pour this beer i am finally about to drink it . the aroma is of chemical , with hints of citrus , but there chemicals really dominate . the aroma is of citrus and grapefruit , with the chemical thing from the aroma not being present . still it has not complexity to it . the mouthfeel is medium bodied with too much carbonation . overall , this is a bad beer that i will not drink again ."

S"pours a beautiful clear amber with a bunch of foamy off-white head that sticks like ... well , sugar . surprisingly hoppy aroma , but the sticky sweet malt balances it nicely . brown sugar is noticeable behind the hops . first taste is the nice hop bouquet followed by a wash of sweet caramel malt , and the brown sugar sweetness . medium body , smooth and creamy as i 've ever tasted , no trace of the abv . dangerous ."

S'nice pour from the nitro can , very dark epa yellowgold with a wonderfully large , retentive white head . smells like sweet caramel , weeds , and nitrogen . nothing special , but very crisp and fruity . tastes almost exactly as it smells . very mild malt starts things off , very sweet and very caramelly . this leads into a mild english hop , spicy and lightly bitter , and continues onward into a light malt finish . can sez this is only 3.8 % abv , and considering that it has an awful lot of character and flavor . i could drink it all night !'

S'happy st pattys day to me . the beer was poured from the nitro can into a pub glass . appearance : the beer poured a black with a ruby opaqueness to light . the beer has a very pleasing reverse cascading of the head during the pour . the head was nearly an inch and a half creamed coffee coloration . the lacing on the glass was practically like pancake batter . smell : the beer has a very good roasted malty characteristic with bits of spicyness floating around . taste : the beer leads very sweet with dark roasted choco coffeeish sort of taste . the creamyness of the beer is some much so that it feels like drinking a combo of chocolate coffee milk . the hops provide a slightly bittering compliment that prevents over sweetness . mouthfeel : the beer is light to medium bodied with a very velvety mouthfeel . this beer is a very well balanced beer treat . drinkability : this is a very quaffable beer . a classic session beer . dam you newcastle for no longer exporting to usa !'

S"appearance : straw/gold color , small head , very little in terms of retention aroma : mild , and at most..honey and grain . taste : some grains , and sweetness from the honey ... but overall it is pretty mild ... i guess mild would be the nicer way of saying `` bland '' , which is what i am leaning towards . its not bad , but i 'm not that impressed by it . mouthfeel : light and carbonated..so it is `` crisp '' in some sense , but otherwise , nothing too special . drinkability : taste is fairly unoffensive , and the mouthfeel is average , so this is good for this . i would n't have a huge problem with a couple of these , its just that i can get much better beers of the same style . nothing special"

S"pours a somewhat hazy , pure scarlet red color , with really no head at all . some bubbles is about it , but the red is really beautiful and deep . 2nd pour did produce a little bit of pink head , but it quickly faded and did n't leave any stick . smell is pure raspberries . not sure what else to say . really pleasant , and comes off slightly sweet , too . taste is also dripping with raspberry flavor . it 's slightly sour but there is some sweetness to it , as well . it 's tart and gets to be slightly harsh through the finish - it puckers your mouth just like a fresh raspberry does , really . there is some earthy yeast flavor that hits right at the midpoint and adds a bit of complexity , but this is really all about the raspberries , which are showcased beautifully . rapsberry flavor takes back over into the finish and i 'm left feeling as though i 've just eaten a small handful of fresh berries . amazing . the earthy quality gets a bit more prominent as it warms . this has a medium/full body and is quite smooth for being slightly tart . it 's somewhat dry through the finish . this is certainly not something i would drink with any regularity , and in fact i would probably share a bottle next time . but this is really an impressive beer that i would gladly have again ."

S"the label description of this stout implies that it is a good stout choice for both stout fan and stout newbie . really ? ? ? the 6.7 % abv is the high end of stouts in my experience , and this ai n't no nitro murphy 's ( which i tried in the same go-round of tastings , and i would consider more appropriate for those unfamiliar with the style . ) a thin reddish brown head resulted from my pour . obsidian is good as a jumping-off point for color , jet black it is , but with some surprising tan sediment in suspension . a little bottle conditioning intended ? nose is not as redolent of alcohol as expected ; it 's actually a fairly light aroma of rich roasted chocolate and chocolate cake . some of the sam smith 's imperial stout `` oiliness '' in the mouthfeel . taste is big and powerfully alcoholic ; rich chocolate and coffee are here . beginning stout drinkers drink this ? really ? ? ? i see this as more of a `` nitro can stouts are for wimps '' selective drinker 's taste . bituminous stout might be more appropriate ."

S"pours dark brown , almost black , with deep reddish hues . nice sized tan head sticks around for a while before dropping to a thin sheet . some sheets of lace are left behind . nice bourbon and vanilla , and a healthy dose of vinegar dominate the aroma . roasted malt , chocolate , and dark fruit lay in the background . starts with nice a bourbon and vanilla character with some charred woodiness . strong sourness comes next - very tangy and overpowering . notes of chocolate , roast , fruit , and a touch of spice round things out . not sure if all the sourness was intentional , but it was just a too strong and dominated what is a very nice and easy drinking porter . finishes bone dry upfront yet with a cloying sourness at the back & top of the mouth . i was really into this beer with the first sip , but that sourness just kept building and really sticks to the back out the tongue . medium-light in body , dry and spicy from tartness on the tongue . alcohol is well hidden and the bourbon adds just the right amount of flavor . not overly woody or liquor-like . the sourness though is too much for me and really takes away from the drinkability . got through half the 750ml bottle and had to bail . i love cl 's nor'easter and enjoyed the rum barrel version . this one just fell short . perfect if you want a bourbon barrel aged american wild ale , but not a ba porter . perhaps a bad bottle , but judging from the other reviews , i 'm just not digging this ."

S"have a few of these , along with a bunch of the barrel aged versions . those `` in the know '' tell me the barrel aged versions are much superior , but i 'll reserve judgment until all have been consumed in my gullet . i was n't that excited about the papier release until i tried melange # 3 , which was phenomenal . pours a slightly ruddy deep brown . basically a thin crust of off-white , maybe tan-nish foam . smells like a f***-load of brown sugar , vanilla , and a hint of bourbon . some dark fruits apparent in the nose . also in the nose : alcohol . big , boozy heat . the taste is similarly boozy . it assaults you with a club . thankfully , the flavors are equally strong . more vanilla , more brown sugar , a hint of leather and molasses , and some dark fruit . very strong flavor , high quality ... just a bit hot . even for me . mouthfeel is good , but a tad thin for a beer of this abv and flavor-strength . a good brew , but i 'm looking forward to trying the barrel aged versions ... this one , price-wise , is a bit too expensive for what it is ."

S'no fresh date visible . this beer poured a clear bright pale yellow gold color that was incredibly carbonated as we watched the bubble dance in the light . the small white colored foam was produced in the first pour , then , fell to nothing except a small ring on the edges . lace was present but faint and barely visible . the aroma was fresh , clean and crisp , but no real smell except some sweet corn grain and malts . plus i did get a whiff of lime , but i think it was from the one sitting next to the glass in the napkin . the tastes that i experienced were sweet malts ( faint ) , citrus ( not from lime ) , sweet grains ands a real slight hop bite . no after taste present . light medium bodied . this is a crisp and clean beer from down under ( mexico ) . nothing really spectacular - just what it is , refreshing and a good accompaniment to the carnitas that i was eating . i would get again over some beers that i have had in the past .'

S"12 oz bottle , new brewery out of milwauke , they brew 2 pedestrian beer styles . this one pours crystal clear straw with a bright , foamy white head . the smell is light and airy , with some grains and hops . the flavor is interesting , it has a nice crispness and a higher hoppiness for the style . the yeast gives it a subtle frutiness . it has kind of a crappy malt flavor though . if you like americanized versions of german beers you might like this one . the brewery has a nice beer out of the gate , i would love them to brew a different style though , this does n't touch the german ones ."

S"thought there may have been something wrong with this one , but since all the other reviews seem to match my experience exactly , i 'll throw my thoughts in as well . the idea of beer and maple is probably the holy grail for canadian beer drinkers . i do n't know any canadians who have n't dreamed of the day these two great things can be combined ( well ) . a maple bock sounded like just what we had all been waiting for . unfortunately , as has already been pointed out , something went wrong . to borrow from another review , cola is a pretty apt description for the pour and head , and like that reviewer i was still clinging to hope . sweet aroma with a hint of maple in there somewhere , but it certainly does n't jump out at you . i tried so hard to like it , but my taste buds put up too much of a fight . the sourness is overwhelming . like the aroma , there was a maple hint somewhere in there but it was incredibly hard to get the taste and keep it , it was very slippery . through all that there was a pleasant smokiness to the malt that was as elusive as the maple . these two notes hint at the possibility of a great beer , but this is n't it . the cloying sweetness kept me from even finishing the beer and my girlfriend refused the rare chance to finish one of my drinks after trying it herself . keep dreaming maple lovers ."

S"dark ochre with more brick red than brown . the upper half of the glass filled with ecru colored foam following the pour . the cap looks good at the start and gains even more character as it melts . it 's also nice and sticky , with pulled taffy bridges appearing between head and glass . attractive and abundant lace . just as peche mortel smells more like coffee than any stout i have ever had , this offering smells more like pepper than any beer i can imagine . these guys do n't mess around . they must have dumped the green and black peppercorns into the kettles with something approaching reckless abandon . this could be interesting . wow ! double wow ! ! route des epices tastes like liquified pepper corns . while that might be appealing to some people , it is n't appealing to me . with a spice this powerful , a little restraint is called for so that all of the beer 's flavors can work together in harmonious fashion . brasserie dieu du ciel blew right past restraint , did n't give a second look at generous , and decided not to stop at excess . the flavor profile includes pepper . that 's it . i have no idea why the brewer ( s ) decided to make this a rye beer since there 's no way that rye malt can be appreciated amid the blast of heat that scorches the mouth , tongue and throat each time the glass is upended . most chile beer is n't this fiery . not pleasant . the mouthfeel , along with the appearance , is a highlight among lowlights . it 's at least medium in heft and is as smooth as possible given the raspiness of the peppery heat . carbonation is neither a positive nor a negative . i enjoy hot-spicy food and use tabasco liberally in chili and a few other things . i even like the idea of a pepper-flavored beer , as long as the pepper is an accent and not an 800 lb . gorilla , as it is in route des epices . sorry , pass ."

S"what the hell lost abbey ? sure i can start by saying it poured a deep brown color with ruby highlights . that it had absolutely no carbonation . there were flavors of raisins , figs , leather , and sweet alcohol . however , the main point here is that this thing was cloyingly sweet like my first attempt at brewing a barley wine before i understand concepts of residual sweetness resulting in me dumping that batch down the drain . this thing was so sweet i thought it did not get properly fermented so i logged onto lost abbey 's web site and got their beginning and finishing gravities and checked it with my hydrometer . it was , to my surprise , attenuated as advertised . sickingly sweet and no carbonation . i can only hope this was some experiment batch or there are quality control issues going on at lost abbey because it was horrible . i 'll stick to the other quads in the future ."

S"( repost since my original review strangely disappeared ) i find most light beers to be unspectacular ( or some , just downright nasty ) . molson canadian light surprised me in that for the most part it remained true to the regular version . sure regular molson canadian is n't a very spectacular beer in itself , but i just found it surprising that a beer 's light counterpart actually has some taste . molson canadian light poured a bright straw color with a golden hue . a decent foamy white head formed and lasted about a minute . the smell is of light grains with a slightly sweet character to them . the mouthfeel was watery and fizzy like any light beer . the initial taste struck me as sweet , as the grain flavors made their way through . although not awful , corn does seem to be a primary flavor in this brew . the usual light beer wateriness is here , but i kept on thinking that this stuff tastes alot like the original . one thing that sets them apart is that i detected almost no hops here whatsoever . no bitterness or dryness to be found . the aftertaste was light , with some lingering husk flavors and grainy/corny sweetness . also there is no alcoholic warmth in the end to finish this one off . this had less hop flavor , more wateriness , and more husk flavors and sweetness than the regular version , but once you get past that the two are very closely related . not too bad for a light beer , although i certainly do not plan to drink this regularly . definitely easy to drink , and as clean as clean gets ."

S"reading over the reviews , it seems this is an entirely different beast on-tap than it is in the bottle . the pour i 'm reviewing was served in a snifter at blue palms brewhouse in hollywood . opaque seal brown body with a dense finger of tan cream . good retention ( especially for the abv ) , almost like a layer of chocolate milkshake floating atop a massive espresso shot . full sheets of lacing and rivulets of legs . clearly there is no attempt to disguise the full barrel aged notes . heavy and complex mix of vanilla , coconut , and tobacco immediately suggestive of bourbon or even rye whiskey . molasses , prunes , dark chocolate , and burnt sugar join the barrel notes to form an intoxicating whole . there is a touch of pepper from the alcohol when you bring the glass closer to the nose . impeccable really ... the flavor profile carries over everything from the aroma and adds a low roast malt element ; this is joined by faint hop notes to balance the ensuing sweetness which lingers into the finish along with rich licorice , molasses , and chocolate . another subtle wave of wood smoke , pepper , toast , and maybe coffee appears long after the rest of the flavor has dissipated . very well done - while lacking the singular alchemy of firestone 13 , it is otherwise more akin to that superlative blend than it is to most examples of ris ( even those that are likewise barrel aged ) . full bodied and chewy , but well carbonated . mild astringency and notable warming . a little sweet overall , and some might find the barrel notes to be obstructive rather than a key feature ... very good as a dessert beer ."

S'i had this on draft a while back , but finally getting around to reviewing based on the growler picked up at cbx last weekend . pours a bright , straw gold with a snowy white , one finger head ; lots of carbonation going on . smell is dominated by clean , bready malts . taste is of light malted grains / bread crust with a touch of grassy hops ... finishes with a nice bit of sweetness followed by a well balanced bite . also , a little fruity / estery-ness in there . mouthfeel was pushing medium-bodied and surprisingly creamy - i was really surprised by the mouthfeel . drinkability ... yes ! awesome stuff ! so refreshing !'

S'this beer pours a bright yellow color that really looks watered down with a short white head . the aroma is of mild hops and malt , but only faintly . the taste is not much different but it is carbonated accordingly . the high carbonation and low taste makes it go down nicely which is why its drinkability is so high . this beer could be used with the intention of getting drunk , except that it is more expensive than other beers that will do the same . if there were a value column , this beer would get a 1.0 or lower if that were possible . the taste is not worth the price .'

S'i consider myself lucky to have gotten this wild ale aged in cabernet barrels at bullfrog today - one of only ~150 bottles . it was released today and knocked my socks off . a : pours a hazy copper with a one finger white head . complete opaque with haze and just glowing with a nice yellow orange tint . s : bullfrog always amazes me with the stunts they pull . smells incredibly funky and brett-driven with very floral notes but by no means hoppy . tons of tart lemon rinds , cabernet barrel aging , lemon juice , tart cherry , dry oak , and a somewhat sweet caramel . i want my nose in this beer all day . t : the flavor prolongs and lasts at least 10 seconds in your mouth before going away , it was very nice . tart lemon peel , brett funk , cabernet , tart red grapes , sour caramel , tart light fruits , and another tart fruit that almost reminded me of a wildflower . edit : tried this again after the initial release and the flavors are bouncing off the walls and in no form of collaboration . this is not aging gracefully . was much better fresh on release day .'

S"a decent low-end brown , widely available . not something to look for , though . pours a mahogany color with no real head to speak of , even on an agressive pour . aroma is of malt and faint dark bread smells , maybe a tinge of coffee and chocolate . taste is rather bland . has hints of doughy yeast and a bit of hazlenut or another nutty flavor . malt is not well balanced with the hops - too much on the malty side . it just does n't have much in the way of flavor going for it . the mouthfeel is very carbonated , but somewhat watery for an english brown . it is quite drinkable , though , because it goes down pretty easy and has a low abv % . a good intro beer for the uninitiated , i suppose , and an alternative to swill if you ever find yourself in a bar with no selection needing a beer ."

S"had this on tap in cleveland - the descrription of this local brew intrigued me - it looked good on the pour , a big fluffy head on a deep amber body - smell was intriguing as well , herbal notes prevailed - but tasting this stuff produced a 'whoa ' from me and a 'blech ' from the wife - i 've had some good farmhouse ales and not much in the way of the saison style , but as a beer the coriander , chamomile , herbal , grassy action was a bit too much to handle - a little sticky in the mouth as well - with a taste i really did n't want to stick around - i finished the pint but could n't possibly have another -"

S"got this an extra with trade with ba smakawhat , so a big thanks to him . poured into pint glass a clear golden yellow-orange , fairly light in color for an ipa , but retains a respectable , white creamy head , leaving a good dose of sticky , thick white lacing . malt , grains , grassiness dominate the nose . average standard ipa aroma without the citrus . upon sipping , i can detect grains , malts then the hops come in . hops a little more faint than i wanted , but still meets the standard for american ipa . body is medium , maybe a little light , with mild carbonation . hops do linger on afterward , for a good reasonable while , which i like a lot in my ipas , so it all adds up to being a good , standard american ipa . easy to drink several in a setting , it 's nothing special , but makes a good standard american ipa to sessionize ."

S"poured from the 22oz bottle into a pint glass . body is a bright , deep golden color , topped by a small , bright white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass . aroma of grassy hops with a hint of pineapple , balanced nicely by some slightly sweet , light malt with a hint of caramel . palate is balanced up front , with the light sweetness of the malt holding its own against the assertive grassy hops . the hops win over towards the finish , with notes of pineapple and skunk , along with a touch of astringency . body is light and not at all sticky , which is a bit of a surprise for a hoppy ipa - i guess the resin got boiled out of the hops , or they used some extract . regardless , it makes for a nice , easy-drinking ipa that 's a bit short of a hop bomb , but can still hit the spot ."

S"ok , so my silence is brokenon beer reviews , going through my copious notes and listening to my ryan adams essential mix cd i think that tonight is a good night to start reviewing beers on ba again ! anyway , i had the luck to try this one quite a few times , i obtained a few bottles in different trades ... this is a good one , here is what i thought : this one departs its 12 ounce bottle and hits the glass a super dark cola/ruby brown colour that nears midnight black in shade . the head is quite large and dark brown in colour . the aromas of this beer are great , it reminds me of a lighter dark lord with a nice resiny medicinal hop blend and some serious roasted malt notes . the taste is quite good . a little hot , but better than the 2005 dark lords i have sampled . the flavor profile is also very similar to dark lord . this is one hoppy imperial stout , but it 's not too over the top for my tastes . the smooth deep roasted malt flavors blend with the green oilly hops to make one serious malt shake here . sans the sludge of the 2004 dark lord . mouthfeel is thick , but not toooo thick and the drinkability whilst good , suffers a bit from the slight heat and high abv this club from bells is pulling behind it . overall thoughts : a quality imperial stout that is similar to dark lord but much cheaper and a bit less brash . awesome stuff , i wish this was not a one off celebratory brew . bell 's should make this one a year round affair ."

S"12oz . bottle into a nonic . the pour raises a 1/2 '' dense , off-white head that leaves some lace as it recedes . the beer is a very clear bright copper . aroma is of strawberry preserves , grain , iced tea , and a hint of roast . first sip brings grain husk , quickly followed with an intense sweetness and more strawberry preserves ! slow malty finish with just enough bitterness to keep things balanced . full bodied with low carbonation brings the drinkability down a little but this is still a very nice satisfying take on the style ."

S"had on tap at three floyds into a snifter/tulip consecutively after the regular moloko . poured jet black , not much of a head to speak of aside from some bubbles forming a ring . naturally with no head , there was n't really any lacing left behind . aroma was pretty much straight bourbon , quite hot on the nose . i did n't really perceive any of the wonderful vanilla and oak notes that usually come with barrel aging . the stout itself barely managed to break through the bourbon but slight notes of chocolate made it through . taste was again straight bourbon . this time i struggled to pick up any of the stout properties . it tasted like i was drinking bourbon on the rocks . quite hot on the way down . it 's like all the characteristics of bourbon i do n't like were transferred to the beer and none of the good came with it . mouthfeel was medium bodied , smooth , but the hot alcohol made it a bit bracing . i was very disappointed in this one . i normally love bourbon aged beers but this one failed greatly . i 'd take the regular moloko over this any day . double your serving size as well ."

S"black black black is the color of this truly lovely beer . small creamy light brown cap with great retention and lacing . aroma is of tar , oats , raspberries , sourness , and acidity . the flavors are all subtle and blend wonderfully : seems like a cross between a milk , an oatmeal , and an export stout . smooth tobacco finishes with chocolate , dark fruit and a bit of acidic sting . i do find that overall there is a surprising lack of coffee , chocolate , and alcohol aromas and flavors . compared to modern expectation of an imperial stout , this is very mild , but complex nonetheless . velvety texture . quaffable . sam smith products tend not to impress me much , but this beer is very good . however , i get a sense of polish on this brew that somehow comes across as being `` over-produced '' like a pop album . perhaps it is because no flavors stick out much - there are no rough edges . when i want an imperial stout , i want the beer to take chances and be a little bolder . this is a nice , smooth brew that i will remember as a stronger sweet stout with very blended , subtle flavors ."

S"thick brownish appearence , good amount of head . smells sweet , like bread . the taste delivers , the massive amount of malts really comes through with caramel/chocolate undertones . hops balance the malt out though , to give this beer a satisfying finish . an aftertaste of alcohol is detectable on some sips , but that 's understandable given its abv . mouthfeel is very rich and thick , probably one of the thickest beers i 've ever tasted . its quite drinkable in the taste department , but will fill you up very fast , and is definitely not a session beer . a very well-balanced dopplebock that goes down very smooth . it 's a shame this is a seasonable ."

S"ewwww ... bitter beer face ! those commercials were probably the only redeeming quality of this beer ( i especially like the one with goldberg in it ) . this is one of coors subpremium brands that is promoted by saying it 'll never give you `` bitter beer face . '' while it is true that this is an easy one to pound down , take the time to taste it and you 'll know why you 're paying subpremium prices for this . keystone light pours a sickly pale straw color that is similar to its cousin coors light . the thin fizzy head disappears almost instantly and the carbonation is quite active . with all the fizzing about , this beer is quite noisy ! the nose smells of sweet grains , alcohol , and a slight husky smell . the mouthfeel of course is very watery and fizzy . on the tip of the tongue , the beer tasted slightly of lemon in a way . elsewhere , it is very watery with the adjuncts , especially corn , make their way through . throw in a slight alcohol taste in there too . the malt taste is extremely slight as is the hops , which are there mostly to add a miniscule amount of dryness to the finish . after all , this brew was made to be easy swillin ' . aftertaste is clean for the most part , with a slight veggie taste present along with some corn . the beer finishes with no alcoholic warmth . i would recommend this over coors light because this stuff actually has some taste to it . another beer best left to broke college kids ."

S"pours a dark coffe-like caramel color -- almost black-also resembling molasses . leaves very little head with a moderate amount of lacing . it has a sour smell up front but then a real syrupy-malt with some buttery characterstics too . it maybe one of the best winter warmer style beers i 've had . i remember previous years of this also being very good but there seems to be a huge difference in taste depending on whether it comes on-tap or from a bottle . much better on draught . it has the slight sourness on the front again and then there is a nice cinnamon clove pine-sap taste to it . very appropriate for this style beer especially since it is not overdone as some examples of this style are . even the bottled version of this might be a little too sappy and spicy but the draft one is cleaner or less sticky . also has some malt character through the middle and finish . while it does finish with some stickiness -- it is quite pleasant and mellow -- not overdone . the mouthfeel is a mix of sweet pine and cinnamon with a very pleasant sappiness . the drinkability is a little beter than average . this beer is not attempting to be a session beer so its hard to properly rate it . two of these would be enough unless it was brutally cold outside and you 're having these in front of a fire . then maybe 3 or 4 would be just fine ."

S"had this one on tap at the moan and dove when they were showcasing the heavyweight brewery . they originally had a bunch of draft offerings , but by the time i made it this was the only one left . too bad . this is one of those beers that either you 're crazy about or you really do n't like it . i think i 'm more on the `` really do n't like it '' side . appears to be a pretty typical amber color , perhaps darker than your average lager . it 's definately not a dopplebock , as it says on this site , at least as i understand the style . this beer is pretty hard to categorize i guess . anyway , the smokiness just really is n't my thing . basically that killed this whole beer for me . i could tell there were other nice sweet malty notes in there and some hop bite but the smoked flavor took over . thinking about it now really just makes me think of a beer with a cigarette put out in it . like i said , just not my style . if you know that you really dig these smoky style beers then it might be great in your opinion , but if not , i would say avoid this one ."

S'this was a huge mistake . i was browsing the beer selection at a small-town grocery store in the mt . rushmore area . the regional distributor happened to be there restocking . she saw what i was selecting ( ipas ) and acknowledged that she had nothing similar but that i would really like this stuff . i politely accepted her suggestion and bought some . i have never tasted beer like this . kinda flowery or perfume-laden . just not right for me . very pale yellow and clear . one sip was enough for me .'

S"this beer is a true holiday treat . it differs from other holiday beers because it does n't have any of that spice nonsense , but focuses more on a strong , warming brew . it 's a hop-lover 's paradise , from the moment it 's aroma flows to your nose until the last drop is swallowed . while the hops are pronounced and intense , they are not overly dominating which provides a nice counter-balance to the maltiness from the high alc % . it 's seasonally available on tap as well , and makes a fine `` black and tan '' when mixed with guinness ."

S'thanks to talisker for the extra ! pours a very crisp yellow almost orange with almost no head . aroma is sweet malt with very subdued hops in the back . the taste is actually extremely bland , very hard to distinguish it from the macro guys . the beer is very light , but the blandness overpowers any mouthfeel aspects . this one was just about a drain pour .'

S"acquired via trade from paulthebeerguru , so a big thank you goes out to him . poured from a 12oz bottle into a us tumbler pint glass . a : the beer is a light amber color , with a very thin off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass . s : the aroma is a little pungent and contains light malts , belgian yeast , some fruit and some spice . t : the taste is sweet up front with flavors of apples , bananas and spices , then some harsh flavors of belgian yeast and hops come and cause a nasty bitterness . none of the flavors seem to compliment each other at all . the after-taste is bitter-sweet . m : crisp but not smooth at all , medium body , medium carbonation , finish is clean . d : i did n't find it tasty and it did not go down very well , not too filling , good kick , not a good representation of style , i would not choose this beer again under any circumstances ."

S"served in a maudite tulip at hamilton 's tavern in san diego for five dollars , this one seemed to be the popular brew that day , reviewed from notes taken a few weeks back , was excited to get to try this draught only beer a-color was a dark ruby red that was on the verge of being brown , 1 1/4 inch off white slightly creamy head , stuck around for close to five minutes , decent retention , nice lacing s-hops and i mean tons of them , piney and floral accents as well , big caramel malt scent , some honey , slight boozy aroma , faint dark fruits , some citrus , and toffee t-i have to almost prepare myself mentally to drink a barleywine and this one did not take much preparation , the hoppiness threw me off from the first sip to the last , there was some sweet malt and fruity accents in the middle , but dry bitter notes were present at all other times , there was not much a boozy flavor either , which is almost standard in this style of beer , nicely balanced but i may be a little biased because i am a huge fan of hops and for once they were not overshadowed by malt and alcohol in a barleywine m-dry , bitter , sometimes chewy , and slightly sweet mouthfeel , suprisingly not boozy , lots of carbonation , taste lasted a good while , the thinnest body i have ever seen for a barleywine d-barely could finish my glass but that was mainly because the abv immediately caught up with me , not heavy on the stomach , alcohol is very well hidden for how strong it is , would have been fine with a six ounce serving though this seriously could have passed for an imperial ipa it had so much hops in it , the color is the only thing that might make you think otherwise for the majority of the time , never heard of this beer before seeing it here , can not go wrong with drake 's high alcohol beers in my opinion , would love to drink again , definitely recommended"

S"oh boy , just moved back to edmonton and managed to snag a remaining 6 pack of this at the sherbrooke liquor store . dark black in colour , although the opaque facade shatters when held up to light , where it takes on a bright reddish cola hue . thin beige head that quickly dissipates . the aroma is heavenly decadence ... rich potent chocolate and cocoa , and the unmistakable smell of cherry extract , it all works . i could n't even tell the characteristics of the malt , the adjuncts are that intense . the flavour is a big hit of milky chocolate , with the sweet cherry appearing close to the finish . the finish is actually a dry sweet hit of cocoa , which blends with the cherry again on the aftertaste . the mouthfeel is medium-bodied , yet on the light side . it does n't accentuate the bold flavours , but it does make them easier to swig down faster . this is basically liquid black forest cake in a bottle . not something i can drink everyday , but i do hope jim plans on possibly making this the xmas seasonal at his store , as it is a wonderful little indulgence , and one that i enjoyed sharing . there have been some new beer converts with the aid of this one ."

S"this is a beer that will definately convert you to belgian ale . i can not believe how juicy and malty this amazing beer is . this is the kind of beer that will definately expand your palate and your insatiable craving for better and better beers . i poured this beer into a st bernardus watou trappist ale glass - wow was i lucky to get ahold of this glass in cincinnatti - thank you giri from dorothy lane in springboro . the head rose quickly and stayed around a half inch throughout the session . i poured this one at around 48 degrees and decided to let it warm to keep the carbonation in a little - based on much appreciated reviews . the aroma is of big vinous fruit and medicine - but in a good way . it has an almost indescribable frothy , malty , sour aroma that seems to change as you inhale . the taste confirms the complexity . i am completely overwhelmed by the fruit flavor , the malty juiciness , and the alcohol is only observable by the fact that i am getting more and more giddy as i drink it . it has a very zen like quality that seems to very much calm me as i enjoy it . the mouthfeel is huge . i can not believe a beer with such vivacious carbonation could be so creamy and malty . it 's like a lamic in carbonation and a scotch ale in maltiness with a belgian big beer character that seems to say , `` you are one lucky individual . '' this beer looses a bit in drinkability - not because you do n't want to drink six of these , but because 1 ) it has 10 % abv and 2 ) it 's around 9 bucks per 11.2 ounce bottle ( but oh so worth it ) . i think i will pick up around 20 of these next trip to florida ."

S'look - pours cloudy red with amber at the edges . 1-finger bubbly head with average retention , little lacing to speak of . smell - strong acidic sourness , tart apples , and a distinct musty aroma . taste - tart cherries and apple on the tongue , general fruitiness on the palate , and a mellow cranberry and oak going down . mild dry aftertaste . feel - highly carbonated , accentuates the sour notes on the tongue , otherwise rather light drink - if sour and fruity is your thing , this one goes down no problem . more on the mild side of what can be accomplished with the style .'

S"picked up 4 bottles last christmas ( 2005 release ) and had one while at the brewery appearance : pours a deep reddish brown . syrupy and with as it is swilled in the glass it has minimal carbonation . legs of alcohol form on the glass as it settles ( indicating the high alcohol ) . aroma : smells of chocolate cake with a warm raspberry sauce . complex malt and dark fruit aromas . taste and mouthfeel : heavy dark malt sweetness with a slight tart raspberry character . somewhat syrupy and cloying with caramel and cake . alcohol is hidden well but is definitely there in the finish with a slight throat burning . carbonation is very light and only slight helps refresh the tongue from the syrupy sweetness . drinkability : this is definitely not an everyday beer . even if you could get it . its very complex and i still ca n't get past the chocolate and raspberry aroma . this would be an occasional sipper possibly for desert or with a dark chocolate sampler . $ 10 per bottle is a little steep but it is worth the occasional expense . if it was less or i could afford it , this would definitely be used in a raspberry reduction ."

S"poured from a 12oz can into a goose island matilda goblet . in the air the pour stream is a very dark brown but once in the glass becomes enough to be opaque / black . the head is a light brown and very tall so the carbonation must be somewhat high . head reduced to a lumpy foam then dissipated completely in a short time . smell is light , not too rich or outstanding . taste is somewhat light and sweet and not really anything amazing as far as i 'm concerned . not a bad beer but not really what i would look for in a stout . to each their own i suppose . drinkability is high as the abv is not too high and the mouthfeel is smooth and easy . the beer rolls across the tongue lightly with the bubbles biting just a little bit . overall drinkable , but not my cup of tea ( or beer ) . was worth the try ."

S"why ca n't my hectic , annoying weekends come during my three month vacation ? ? ! ! in any event ... ok , a relatively new brewery should never be charging $ 8.99/bomber for anything . they are calling this a belgian `` style '' ale . we 'll see , kids ... pours a deep amber with hints of orange . only the slightest haze sits in this here brew . no real head forms , and no real lacing . it 's carbonated a lot more than i would have expected for an 11 % abv ale . just a touch above par . nose is somewhat subdued but what there is is loaded with sour stone fruit of the cherry and peach varieties . some raspberry seems to be in there too . a touch , just a wisp mind you , of funk , too . nice and kind of unique . flavor is thinner than i would have wished . are they sure this is 11 % abv ? some real funky sour notes right upfront . not overwhelming by any means . no real sweetness either , which is kind of surprising . the malt character is really downplayed in this brew . almost no `` punch '' to it . a little thin all the way through . finish is very dry and not at all hoppy . this is a bizarre and intriguing brew , but not elite or even in the 2nd tier . it 's very unique and i still ca n't believe it 's 11 % abv . a pretty nice effort but too expenisve for my tastes . what i like most : the interesting and dilectible aromas . what i like least : the price and thinner-than-expected flavor profile . verdict : unique but a little too expensive . try as a novelty ."

S"like drinking beef jerky . so this beer pushed by beer reviewing philosophy . does one review beers based on style or based on beer as an overarching beverage ? my philosophy is to rate beers by style . in this case i 'm not particularly fond of smoked beers , so i 'd always rather reach for a good stout , porter or amber ale . but when comparing this beer to other smoked beers ( like nabc 's cone smoker ) this beer is best in class . i 'm probably not going to add much to what others have said in their well written reviews . the smell and taste remind me of meat . being a michigan boy i recommend drinking this beer with venison on a cold winter day . i have to think that drinking more than a pint of this beer in one sitting is difficult for anyone and the flavors are so powerful ."

S"2010 edition . opened for my father 's birthday celebration and shared with my wonderful family . about 5 oz for me : ) into an open mouthed glass , this looks brilliant ! ! ! black with dark tan head , no lace , but the head is creamy and sticks around . a perfect looking beer in every way except that there 's a small ring of alcohol that kills the lace . it really does look intimidating as it pours , coming out of the bottle with motor oil thickness . the glass sits on the table almost pounding it 's fist into an open hand , saying `` just try it , i dare you '' . smell is dark fruit , dark molasses , chocolate , and a touch of coffee and hoppy bitterness . the smell is a great mix of different notes , but i have had a few ris with slightly more pronounced roast . this has more sweet syrup and a touch of soy sauce , still great , just different that what i consider to be perfect . taste is exceptional . chocolate cake , chocolate covered cherries , touch of vanilla , dark coffee liquor . a hint of bitterness that ultimately ends up sweet . each sip is 25 calories of perfection , and just a touch of hotness in this new kicked-up abv version . i think this does taste a bit better than the 2009 already . such an amazing , powerful force of flavor , all flavors dialed up to 11 . yeah , that 's right , dark lord goes to *eleven* . mouthfeel is utter perfection . milkshake thickness , creamy , perfect viscosity and carbonation . really , really brilliant and perhaps the most legendary characteristic of this beer . drinkability , well , who are we kidding . even on a curve for a huge abv beer , this is not incredibly drinkable . but it 's world class in every way and is something i wish more beer drinkers had the chance to appreciate . special occasions just seem that much more special when dark lord comes to the party . cheers to my pops - happy birthday , you 're the best dad ever !"

S"a - poured out a very dark brown color , alonst opaque with a small , tan head . a little lace that does n't linger long . s - cherries , some caramel and light chocolate ... nothing in the smell is overpowering . t - the tart cherry flavor is too much . the malts and chocolate are drowned out by the very tart cherry taste . m - silky mouthfeel . a medium-bodied beer . d - this was difficult to drink . the tartness is very difficult on the salivary glands and it stays in the mouth for a long time . there really are no other flavors that can harmonize with the tartness ."

S"a - hazy orange amber with almost no head , yet impressive retention for said `` almost no head . '' i suppose it is fueled by the intense carbonation visible through the head . no lacing . s - a very strong hop presence somewhere between pine and diesel . odd , yet not unpleasant . t - strong hops , but not as an upfront pine , rather a very potent ( dare i say brutal ) bitterness that lingers long . it is definitely of the same vein as that smell . there is a fainter pleasant malt profile that is negligible next to the hops . it is an enjoyable bitterness to say the least . m - carbonation is way too strong , thin , and a tiny bit drying from the hops . d - this is the only beer that i have had to date which simply knocks me out . i must have a reaction to this particular style of hops . three quarters of the way through the beer i passed out . i like it , but i could never session this . it makes me feel like i 've been drugged . so , drinkable for most , not for me . if i drank this with turkey it is likely that i would od on hops and tryptophan . it should be noted though that i do like the beer . i will have it again , maybe the next time i have insomnia ."
