S"poured from a 12 oz . bottle : a : dark color ; has a tint of amber to it . nothing exceptional about the appearance . s : creamy smell , but very tame ; lacks any strong or bold odor . t : similar to the smell . pleasant and very drinkable , but lacking any type of dominating flavor . for a leinenkugel 's brew this is pretty solid , but it lacks enough actual taste to be a truly good beer . m : same as taste . d : very very drinkable . i could have six of these and not know the difference . overall , this is a completely average dark lager ; i wish they would have attempted to add more flavor to the brew . however , i will say this is my favorite leiny product ."

S"i like drinking this skunk beer when it 's hot outside . i like sitting in my chair reading some stephen king and sipping on this shit . it goes down faster than gatorade on a hot day . it 's about all its good for , plus it 's f'in cheap , you hear mofo 's ! ! do n't be too snobby , when cash is low , get your ass on down to the local gas station and grab you a 12-pack of this swill . snobs are good for one thing and that 's nothin ' ! !"

S'2004 version . pour is dark with a crimson hue to light . very big piney nose . significant malts too - plumy . the maltiness is there upfront , but the hops come on ( this is avery ! ) big midmouth . a great roastiness dances in and out with a fruity sweetness . a huge hoppy finish of pine , grapefruit - and more of the plum . this beer is big . alcohol warmth is there - but not burning . it pushes me just to endge - slightly harsh , but enough complex flavors to get me . i thought the 2003 version went just over that edge . this year , it does not . a fine version of an americanized style . my favorite strong ale of this season ( so far ) .'

S'i had on cask at the brewpub , served in an imperial pint . the beer is hazy straw in color with a delicate little white head . the nose is earthy and hay like . it has a creamy mouthfeel and subtle flavors , hay , sweet malt and a pleasant breadiness . the beer finishes with light bitterness . i know understand why people have to have bitters on cask , a really well done brew .'

S'presentation : sampled from one of four ever-rotating guest beers on sale at the wakefield labour club ( a.k.a . the red shed ) during a recent trip back home to england . one of two eastwood and sanders brews on sale on the night we returned from our annual belgium trip . appearance : pale golden body with a deliciously creamy toothpaste white head which shines . nose : pale malts with a hint of hops . a slight hint of lemon , but a low key nose overall that doesnt upset much . takes a while to pull in the aromas . taste : light entrance with a classic pale mild ale feel from start to finish . gentle sweet malts in the background balance perfectly with a refreshing mountain water feel and a crystal clean low hop strata . lovely stuff . mouthfeel : very clean and refreshingly crisp , the body is delicate , light but never thin or wanting for the style or tastes presented . drinkability : a true session brew that just about any one could manage a gallon of , i know i could drink this one all afternoon . overall : a freshly tapped cask of eastwood and sanders is always a treat . the first light is brewed in a style known as pennine light , a local pale mild ale of sorts . damn tasty stuff and thoroughly enjoyable .'

S"tona is ubiquitous in nicaragua . you can not find a bar that does not serve it in its ' own refrigerator with a handy thermometer on the outside . this comes in handy as this beer is best served cold which in a hot climate is ideal anyway . the beer is rather light in flavour , slightly malty with a barely discernible hop presence . this is perfect however and goes down really easily while on the beach , in a bar with a fan or a hammock . i would say i liked its counterpart , victoria slightly better which had more taste and alcohol . between these two , you are not likely to find much else in nicaragua ."

S"appearance : copper coloured . a little darker than your average ipa . small half-finger head on the pour . smell : i took a whiff from the bottle and holy wow . so much hops it 's almost comical . there is a slightly candy-ish sweet aroma coming through . taste : i 've never had an ipa ( imperial or otherwise ) that is this sweet , initially . it is a pleasant sweet , however and as i think about it , not overpowering . obviously dfh tried to somehow counteract the hoppy bitterness with a gigantic mal backbone . the sweetness turns into a sort of salty aftertaste . i can definately taste the booziness ( 9 % ) when i roll it over my tongue . mouthfeel : moderate carbonation . thick and oily mouthfeel leaves a residual hop coating on your tongue . drinkability : i do n't think i could handle more than one in a night . very sweet and thick . the abv is high too so i do n't think it would be wise to polish off a 4-pack of these . overall : this is quite the experience . i 'm a cdn so these beers do n't make it up to the great white north unless we bring em back ourselves . i ca n't say i 've ever had anything like this . the sweet malty backbone with the insane hop profile makes this one of the more memorable beers i 've ever had ."

S"thanks goes to sweemzander for sharing ... i guess . gusher alert ! amber orange . solid two fingers of white head . the aroma is a bit off putting . brett soaked pool toys , mixed with cough syrup and peptol bismo . yuck . the flavors are not any better . it 's like a mouthful of wet used band aids soaked in crappy cherry cough syrup and pepto . loads of carbonation . this was a sick joke to play on people ."

S"received in a trade from saucya , thanks dude ! poured from the bottle into a pint glass . almost an amber color with hints of yellow and zero head ( too careful of a pour ? ) . aroma is a balanced mixture of piny hops and caramel malts . and i 'm not saying the malts remind me of caramel a little , they smell exactly like caramel . pretty interesting . taste starts of with a piny hop bitterness and then transitions right into caramel , much like the aroma . mouthfeel is a bit thin , but nice and smooth . drinkability is high , i could definitely put away a lot of these . i 've recently delved into the world of dipas , and this particular one is unique when compared to the others i 've had . overall i like this beer , but ultimately i wanted something more hoppy ."

S'dark golden hue with brilliant clarity when decanted off the yeast . ivory white head is belgianesque in its thickness , stiffness and persistence . sheets of foam remain . soft light caramel malt runs parallel with mellow citrusy hops in aroma , with secondary notes of biscuit and pearish esters -- seems to be the trademark of their yeast strain . bready , wheaty sweetness upfront in flavor melds into a subtle caramel malt presence . a snap of chewy , maltose like sweetness emerges mid palate is quickly offset by mild , clean hop bitterness . mild tangerine hop flavor complements the bready malt character lending a marmalade on toast impression late . lightly bodied overall , but crisp and passably dextrinous in mouthfeel . finishes with slight acidic twang and fading hop bitterness , but otherwise dry and clean . a balanced , no frills , quaffable american pale and an enjoyable session brew all around .'

S"truth be told , this is n't my favorite style by a long shot , but i 've been impressed by tregs in the past and figured i 'd give this a try . pours a clear amber with a 1/2 '' of frothy head that laces wonderfully and yet cold retain better . the aroma is lightly candied grapefruit and sharp grapefruit pith , sliced oranges , bread and toffee -- nice and crisp and inviting . the taste is malty , sweet , with a rye like aspect , floral orange peel balances out a light , crisp , copper malt . did i say balance . because the balance is spot on . very lemony towards the end . medium bodied and nicely carbonated . no complaints here . not the most thrilling beer ever , and not as hoppy as i expected from something with hopback in the name , but i could easily session the hell out of this beer if it was readily available to me ."

S"my first beer from lagunitas . very interesting . nice deep copper brown color . one finger head , good amount of lacing . very unique smell , like nothing i 've experienced before . molasses , brown sugar , buttery with some malt and a slight hop aroma . very sweet smelling , like brittle or toffee . very sweet upfront- brown sugar indeed . home made caramel with real butter tasting . some strong hop presence to finish . this is interesting to say the least . very smooth , thick and creamy mouthfeel . this is what i would expect a `` cream ale '' to feel like . very velvety and soft on the tongue . nice hop bite to finish . drinkability is only average . i could n't do more than one or two of these in a night . the sweetness really stands out . there is a big hop presence but it still ca n't balance out the strong brown sugar taste . interesting beer . glad i tried it . this would be a great holiday beer to share with others ."

S"a limited release from boulder colorado 's avery brewing in celebration of the inauguration of our latest president . the ttb disallows the use of a president 's name , but the clever label makes it very clear that avery is not a stronghold of the john birch society and i would bet the break room tv is not tuned to fox news . i am immediately greeted by a big hop aroma with plenty of sugary malt coming through . fresh bread , a little red apple , papaya , and a significant but not distracting alcohol aroma round things out . the tropical and resinous hops play well with the apparent and restrained esters . a big 3 '' off-white fluffy head forms off the pour . it quickly dies down to a few thin patches with minimal lace , not surprising with the high alcohol content . the beer is a nice light copper color with some haze that appears to be more from hops than protein . hits the tongue with bread , dry biscuit , brown sugar , oranges and papaya . resinous hops smeared all over with some raw hop cone astringence . fairly well balanced with an increasingly coarse bitterness building against the sugary malts . finish is long with lingering hop and warming alcohol . full bodied with moderate carbonation . a little heavy on the palate . this is n't a small beer by any means , and the alcohol is never hot or boozy , but it drinks like a stronger beer . the bitterness becomes harsher through the glass and begins to really impact the enjoyability . some similarities to their hog heaven barleywine , but with more emphasis on the bitter instead of the malt . i 'll stick to the hog heaven in the future ."

S"pour was dark black/brown with two fingers of tan head that dissipated quickly . immediately there is anise and dark chocolates on the nose . on the first and every drink that follows , there is a distracting , almost overpowering taste of anise/black licorice . on careful analysis ... meaning getting past the anise , there are underlying dark chocolates , subtle coffee , dark fruit . unfortunately these items seem more like afterthoughts . mouthfeel is actually decent with some satin to the texture and light/medium carbonation for a little balance tingle . would have to be in the just right mood for this one . i do n't know when that would be , as i rarely go to the candy store looking for black licorice . that there is a sense of booze/abv coming through is n't helpful , either . that said , there are some excellent foundational elements here that are just lurking but the carpet bombing with anise sinks the prospects ."

S"i 've been digging a few really good pales lately ( town hall brewery , alpha king ) & had a fantastic glass of the sixth glass ( boulevard ) a couple days back , so it seemed a logical next step to review this beer , received as an extra from the kind-hearted & generous turbine2475 . perhaps it suffered by comparison , but this is n't in the league with the two pales noted above . decent nose but weak , taste has a fair bite , but is simultaneously a touch harsh with a bit of watery feeling in the mouth . not bad in the least , but a true lawnmower beer ."

S"pours a cloudy reddish brown . pretty heavily spiced ( as always ) but luckily everything seems to keep the flavors in check . allspice , cloves , cinnamon , nutmeg , peppermint , and spruce tips are just some guesses at what might be in there . pretty similar to the 2007 version , only i 'm picking up a much more obvious malty chocolate profile ... and i can actually taste a little bit of hops that keep it from being too sweet . it 's never going to be something you 're drinking more than a bottle or two of , but it 's improved over last year 's in the balance department . even if it 's not a world beater , there 's something really nice about this brew on a winter 's night . everyone should at least try it ."

S"as a cream ale , rainier ale fails miserably . when drinking this beer keep in mind that it 's gargantuan alcohol content ( as far as cream ales go ) is rather easy to miss as it compares to malt liquors of similar or slightly stronger alcohol contents . around the northwest especially in my town it 's less than $ 2 for a 40oz bottle of this , and this is the way this beer was meant ot be consumed . it is the cheap drunk heaven send of beer . it is meant to be guzzled swilled and inhaled at a furious rate when the necessity of getting completely wasted has arisen . do not mistake this for a decent beer , it is simply something that is easily inhaled quickly when in need of a quick bout of blacking out . it beats the pants off of malt liquor 40oz beers and should be heralded as king of 40'z !"

S"this is an odd one . sampled from a bomber poured into a regular pint glass . half inch head dissipates fairly quickly to a surface foam with minimal lacing ( no doubt due to the elevated abv ) . color is pretty close to a classic old ale , deep amber/copper . aroma is malty sweet with some fruit ( raison & slight banana ? ? ) overtones upon aeration . the taste is pretty good , with malt dominating ; little hop finish . not really an old ale taste though , although i ca n't exactly peg the flavour style.the mouthfeel is surprisingly good , pretty soft carbonation . i definitely felt the abv , so i reduced the drinkability from average . all in all , i liked this one , even though it is not a true old ale ."

S"i am convinced that my first experience with this beer was an infected batch somehow . what i drank was not a wheat ale . it tasted more like a cider and looked like one too . i said to the beer afficianado that was seated next to me that it did n't taste right and so he asked for a taster . sure enough , he proclaimed the batch infected and told the bartender to let the boss know . i know that things happen but they are seriously lacking in quality control if they allow infected beer to be served at their tap . i enjoyed their ipa very much , and i 'm not bashing this place . their pints were ridiculously affordable . i just had a bad experience with their american wheat ."

S"thanks to wasatch for this bottle . poured a thin brownish gold in color with a dense white foam that never quite vanished . nose is `` wet '' -- strong water tones and not much else . but maybe a bit of malts if a really look . very weak flavor . more like carbonated water with some off flavors than a beer to me . malt flavors are thin and more noticeable in the aftertaste than with each sip . just some ever so slight hop presence , but again i find it more in the aftertaste . i would forget i was drinking a beer if it were not for the aftertaste . medium to light mouthfeel that leans toward watery . probably a nice quaffable beer on a hot summer day after yard work but not something to savor in the evening ."

S'this beer was served on draft at the brewpub in a chilled glass with chunks of ice on it and on the inside . i would have complained but the waitress seems annoyed that i was there to begin with . beer is amber , celar , carbonation is moderate to high , lacing on the glass as the had falls away , head is white and diffuse . looks fine . there is no aroma , they must have forgotten they were making an ipa . maybe i should have complained about the iced glass . this beer is thin , watery , has almost no flavor and the flavor that is there is most definitely not an ipa flavor . mild hop bitterness but this beer is just in general gross . give me a break . drinkability ok , but what makes this an ipa ? nothing . its colored water with bad backend bitterness and not much of that even . get a clue . avoid !'

S"picked up a bottle of this on a recommendation from beerman207 , so here goes . poured from the bottle into a pint glass . appearance : pour is a near perfect copper color with about a one finger , thick and oily looking head that fades quickly to a pretty thick and uneven skim floating on the surface ; body is moderately clear and shows very slow carbonation creeping up from the bottom ; spotty and oily lacing holds to the glass briefly before sliding back into the drink . smell : smell is nice - a ton of caramel or butterscotch malts , hints of vanilla/oak ; very rich and sweet smelling , not especially complex but the scents are delicious . taste : much like the smell , there is a blast of those sweet caramel/butterscotch malts , hints of oaky vanilla , , very mild hoppy bitterness and a definite presence of alcohol that manages to come across a little bourbonesque -- not overpowering or overly alcoholic in flavor , a really nice blending . mouthfeel : warm and tingly in the mouth from the alcohol that has a slightly drying effect and there is a mild stickiness left throughout ; belly is left especially warm drinkability : very nice flavors and a nice mouthfeel with a taste that is n't burning my throat out , so it 's got that going for it ... sadly , the abv is apparently unknown but i 'm definitely feeling it , so i do n't think i could sit through too many ."

S'poured into a pint from a 325ml bottle . a : translucent dark amber , small head and some thin lacing on the glass . not a bad looking beer . s : smell is the greatest turn down in almost all mexican macros . people drink out of the bottle most of the time , but once you pour this beer into a glass , the semi rancid aroma steps up . t : light roasted malts , some dry wood and some sweetness . finishes a little seet . m : light body , medium carbonation . d : as a macro , drinkability is high . this is a little bit more expensive than most of mexican macro beers , and could be the best of them . very good to pair with spicy mexican food .'

S'thanx to nopucophop for sending one of these my way a : poured a black like motor oil with absolutely no head present and honestly no lacing either sticking to the glass . s : yup ... . there is plenty of bourbon to go around with brown sugar , oak notes , slight , spice and toffee notes . i did get a little chocolate and roastiness but for the most part the bourbon dominated the nose . t : like the nose the bourbon takes over the palate but does give a little room for the brown sugar , oak , vanilla , and chocolate , to take a peak . it also seemed to have coffee on the tail end of a sip but had cocoa coming through as well and slight hop character as well . m : the brew was full body with a very low amount of carbonation which was sweet , silky , slight chewy , bitter , and boozy finish . d : it drank pretty damn good considering the abv on the beer and was really living up to all the hype . i have to say that it is a beefed up regular breakfast stout and is a brew you definitely have to share with friends .'

S"beer from laos ! apparently this is the national beer of laos ... .and tourists apparently love it . so i 'm happy to have it over here in the usa . the smell was almost exclusively of grains ... very grainy , presumably from the rice it 's made from . the taste is n't earth shattering , though it 's pretty drinkable . the body of the beer has a grain taste to it that has an interesting flavor to it that i struggle to describe , though i 'd say that it 's certainly from the rice . it 's different . the backend , however , is simple . there 's a touch of hop bitterness , which finishes the beer pretty dryly ... .and a whole lot of grain popping up afterwards . not bad , but not a top-tier beer either . i could quaff a few of these on a hot day . and hey , it 's from laos !"

S"for a fruit beer , i think this stuff is fabulous . in fact , i think bbw does a real nice job on their fruit/vegetable beers in general as their blueberry , pumpkin , and even the potato beer are some of the best of their ilk that i know of . pure gold color , minimal head , no lace . its not needed here though . smell and taste are exactly as they 're supposed to be . it reminds me of freshly peeled and chopped up peaches that are just at the right ripeness . its hard to get peaches that taste this good at the supermarket . other taste notes are -peach pit , malt , slight hops and some other fruit characteristic like grape or currant . mouthfeel is very smooth and quenching . only problem here is on the drinkability as it is quite smooth and easy to drink but i think you get sick of these after a couple . maybe on a hot day , it could be consumed in larger quantity ."

S'i shared a 750 ml capped bottle with a wax cover with a couple of beer buddies during a pre-holiday home sampling event . we poured the brew into chilled tulips . a : it poured a reddish brown body that when back lit looked more of a semi-clear ruddy red . there was hardly any head despite a somewhat aggressive pour . the lack of a head limited the lacing to an occasional spot of thin legs that quickly disappeared . s : it had the aroma of over-ripe sour fruits ( e.g. , white grapes , green apples ) . there was a herbal earthy accent that came in and out . t : it bit the tongue with a bitter sour taste that reminded me of a dry white wine . the taste followed the nose resulting in an abundance of ripe sour fruits with green apples dominating . there were also hints of earthy spices but they were quickly overcome by the sour dry flavors . m : it was thin bodied with no carbonation . it started and finished dry and sour . d : this is not my style so i found it hard to enjoy and doubt i will indulge again . it was too reminicent of dry white wine for my taste .'

S"well , figured i would finally break down and do my 100th karma point , what better than chocolate and beer to do it with ? poured a lusciously dark chocolately brown that lets no light through most of it , except when you hold it towards the light , you can see a bit of rootbeer color shining through . the thick , beautiful , light caramel/khaki head settled down to leave only a thickish covering about a quarter inch thick . scented heavily of molasses . thick and sweet . oakiness . light scent of chocolate malts in there ... but it seems to be more the sweet , heavy , molassassy smell that i get . thick and creamy , bit of foaming up in your mouth ... feels a bit like a melted milkshake for the body . tastes of chocolate malts , touch of vanilla beans , bit of oakiness in there maybe ? bit of darkened toast in the aftertaste . slight cola flavor . the sweetness is not overwhelming , just noticable . the flavors are not as intense as i would have expected . guess i thought there would be a blast of chocolate , this is more on the level of a chocolate fountain soda ... do n't get me wrong , this is good stuff . drinkability , well , this is sooo not a session beer . bit too heavy for that . i had heard that it was not a bottle to sit down by yourself with . my beerbud that gifted this to me ( thanks o'blithering one ! ) said he sipped his for about 3 hours ! but i was feeling a bit greedy , and really find this a nice one to sip by yourself and relax with . good for a couple tulips full when relaxing at home . would not think about having it when about to head out for playtime ! nice presentation with the bottle , yeah , no points given for it , but it does look pretty impressive !"

S"finally managed to find this in my area -- sadly , there were only selling it in singles . i guess if i like it i 'll go back and buy 4 more for waxing . review is from notes taken on 9/16/2010 and poured from the bottle to a snifter . appearance : pour is a deep dark brown/near black with some deep ruby highlights on the pour ; starts with a short 1/4 finger loose , but dark tan , head that fades immediately to nothing other than a thin wisp floating around the center of the surface ; body is actually pretty much opaque once it settles ; a few spots and strands of the tan lacing is left holding on to the sides of the glass . smell : on the crack , there are tons spicy and bitter hops right up front ; once it settles in the glass for a little bit , it definitely gets a little bit more complex -- the bitter and grassy hops are definitely present , but there are also some burnt roasty malts , and , good god , man , is that chocolate ? i think it is . i 'm intrigued . nose is pretty potent , and comes with some alcoholic burn , but considering that it 's an even 12 % , this is to be expected . taste : wow , once i get past the huge blast of bitter and grassy hops that the nose led me to believe would be there , i 'm next assaulted by a lot of burnt roastiness that adds to the bitterness of the hops ; at first , i 'm a tad disappointed because it kind of reminds me of just a souped up , big alcohol black ipa , but then the more subtle nuances of the sweeter malts find their way to my palate and there is a very smooth and silky semi-sweet chocolate that really rounds out the palate . mouthfeel : body is of medium weight and starts to lean a bit towards the heavier side ; carbonation is essentially a non-factor it comes across a bit flat , but not in an unappetizing way as it 's pretty much fitting of the style ( imho ) ; a very thick and cottony dry sticky coating is left all over the palate and i feel like i need to have a glass of water with this one to replenish my mouth with any kind of moisture ; belly is left quite warm and the gums are left tingly from all the alcohol lingering in this one . drinkability : while it 's very good , i have to say it 's moderate because of the weight and the big abv , but really , i would kind of expect that anyway ( not to mention that it was $ 5.50 per bottle ) . i will say that this is much"

S"12 oz bottle into a duvel tulip . a : pours a clear , light amber with lots of carbonation and a half-inch head of quickly-dissipating white foam ; a little bit of lace . not bad looking at all , but nothing special here . s : very crisp aroma of toasty malts and understated ( but definitely present ) hops ; reminiscent of a pilsner . just what i was looking for in a lager this style . t : follows the nose with the toasted grain and mild hops , but then takes another spin around the block with just a hint of caramel sweetness peeking out before the final dry finish . the hops bitterness does n't really add much to the beer , though , just a bit of mustiness . i 'd prefer this beer if it emphasized the malt a bit more . m : fairly light-bodied with some spiky carbonation . meh . d : very crisp and refreshing , this is undoubtedly a sessionable brew . notes : of the many entries in the leinie 's lineup in recent years , this is one of my favorites . there 's really nothing off about it ( although the musty hops were n't exactly my cup of tea ) , and it 's refreshing without being low on flavor . solid , if thoroughly unspectacular , beer ."

S"wow smell of piney hops hits you in the smell . i can tell this is going to be a real full flavored beer . the taste is unreal . the taste smacks you in the face with hops and very rich sweet malted barley . very rich tasting . this tastes like an ipa with a shit load of malt . the rich malt flavor reminds me very much of the dogfish head 90 minute ipa malt profile . actually this is like sierra nevada 's celebration ale times 5 . so if you like the celebration ale and want that same taste but with even more bitter hops and and that same malt but a lot more of it this is your beer . actually the celebration ale and this beer have the same ingredients . they both use two row malt and english barley with the cascade chinook and centennial hops . amazing beer this is the total definition of an american hopped barleywine ."

S"2003 vintage . serving date : 2009-06-03 . no visual evidence of cork damage . a : it has a pitch black color . the liquid is thick and lifeless . a rather aggressive pour results in just minimal brown head . the head dissipated quickly but swirls result in some lacings , so the beer seems to have some carbonation . s : the smell is rather special and really weird . think a mix of decent lambic and a not overly roasty and somethat sweet stout - and there you have it . notes of vinegar , funky barnyard and wet hay , and hint of aged cheese . beneath this lie another set or smells , more common to stouts - sweet chocolate , roasted malts , wood and some fruity aromas . initially , i find the smell quite interesting but as the beer warms up and gets to breed , the pungent and funky aromas becomes more prominent and after a while it just gets too assertive . t : the smell is also very weird , and far from good . the beer actually tastes kind of bad . the character of a tart lambik appear here as well , but is not as prominent as in the smell . but still , here are plenty of tart notes that all in all seems rather out of place . in the mouth , there is not much going on , except for some notes of chocolate , coffee and roasted malts . but upon swallowing , things start to happen . a very strong salty taste develops and this does not work well at all with the tartness . soy sauce , green apples , horse blanket and something that reminds me of pickled fish blend in a devilish concoction . some sweetness tries to get everything back on track , but fails completely . in the finish there is a strong note of licorice , some wood and a taste of alcohol that does n't fit well with the other flavors . m : full-bodied with a sticky texture . almost no carbonation and as a result , the beer is too much to handle after a while . d : this is a very strange beer . it 's complex and poorly balanced , and frankly it does n't taste good . some parts of it are nice though ( some components in the smell and some of the tartness in the taste ) , but as a whole , it fails to be anything but a disappointment ."

S"09 release poured into a boulevard smokestack goblet . a - dark black and viscous with oily stains that recede into the glass as you drink it . the pour produced a 1/2 inch dark tan head that dissipated fairly quickly . s - heavy malt , chocolate , mollasses , brown sugar , figs , and plumbs pours out of the glass . one of the most complex aromas from a beer i have ever experienced . t - heavy malt and slight bitterness dominate the flavor . figs , port , and rasins make there way as the beer warms . a slight , but not totally unpleasent alcohol heat . m - just too thick . so much so that i kept concentrating more on how thick it was as opposed to how it tasted . d - this beer is a sipper between friends . drinkability and this beer do n't go hand in hand . a small 8 ounce brandy snifter of this one is all of it i can really take ."

S"pours a cloudy amber color with a large head . aroma is quite sour , difficult to describe otherwise . taste is overwhelmingly sour ... vinegary , i guess . not much else . the label reads : `` amber ale brewed with cocoa powder '' but i personally ca n't detect even the slightest trace of cocoa . certainly an interesting taste , but not to my liking . notes : i tried to review this beer subjectively . personally , i hated it but i 'm sure someone who enjoys an especially tart , unusual beer would absolutely love this ."

S"a - jet black . almost opaque . nice tan had that settles quickly and does n't really lace the glass . s - it has that sweet oatmeal smell to it . roasty and coffee bean like in aroma . t - roasted chocolate is the dominant flavor . bitter from the roasted barley comes through at the finish . a level of sweetness balances it out . i ca n't pick out anything in regards to hops . the bitterness of the grains are more prominent than any bitterness or flavor of the hops . finishes relatively clean with a cloying sweetness that lingers . m - thick due to the oats . very velvety with a big mouthfeel . d - although not a big beer , the sweetness and big mouthfeel make it a bit of a sipper . overall i really like this . i was in the mood for a stout and this fit the bill nicely ."

S"appearance : almost pure black . creamy head , really a thing to behold . the head stuck around for a while , and nice lacing as well . smell : woah nelly . some bready malt , but smells more of chocolate - almost like a chocolate milkshake . really a rich scent . as ron would say , it stings the nostrils . taste : not just chocolate , but milk chocolate . the good kind . a little bitter , but again , milk chocolate dominates the taste . the roast malt taste comes through in the end , but it is really just a complex , tasty chocolate flavor . mouthfeel : a little thin for the rich taste , but silky smooth . pleasant carbonation that is n't over the top . drinkability : not a beer i 'd want to have more than one or two of at once , but definately something i can see myself craving again . well worth having , and could find its way on to many stout-lovers ' list of favorites ."

S"not sure if this was the old batch or new , from the faded hop aroma and almost one dimensional hop flavor i 'm assuming it is the former . from tasting notes : look is golden amber , slight head ; aroma is big malty backbone with alcohol solvency , slight pine resin that is buried by the malt , as the glass warms there is a slight fruity character i 'm picking up as well ( my friend says it smells like stagnant fire suppression water ) . really sweet initially , like a barley wine , mouthfeel is thick and mouth coating . for such a large ipa the bitterness is a bit restrained but does not fade ; it is almost a static attack of constant bitterness that does not ebb on the tongue naturally like most ipas . solvent characters also behave as if they are stripping away the inside of the mouth , like a mouthwash without the pain"

S"had this on tap at the place de la republique , in paris . also had bottled , which i would very much not recommend . 50cl glass , surprisingly pretty head thought it disappears quickly . above average stickage , nothing to write about for the lacing . the smell is again , far better than the bottled version . a touch of honey , weak hops , grainy . i enjoy the taste more than most euro pales , which does n't say much in itself . however , a pleasant faintly sweet taste , mixed with a dash ( literally not more than a dash ) of hops and even some pale malt -- is refreshing on this somewhat hot day . the mouthfeel is just incredibly boring . carbonation strength ca n't make up it 's mind , it is n't particularly creamy or crisp . 1664 doens't know what to do with itself , and i rather dislike that . as for drinkability ... with enough belgian beers being available here , i 'd take any of them over 1664 or any french beer for that matter . the taste , smell and appearance are mediocre , and much is left to be desired ."

S'drank from a 12 fl . oz./355 ml bottle purchased at cambridge wine & spirits , cambridge , ma after all the marketing hype surrounding this beer , i decided to give it a try . the beer poured an ultra-pale , golden yellow with a small , white , bubbly head that quickly dissolved . after a few minutes of sitting , the beer looked completely flat . the aroma was super sweet ( almost artificially sweet ) with strong notes of bubblegum . the taste was sickly sweet and reminded me of a flavored malt beverage . bubblegum was once again immediately noticeable along with cotton candy and soda-like lemon/lime notes ( sprite came to mind ) . some corn came through mid-palate . the finish was malty rich ( in an adjunct sort of way ) and very sweet , yet rather citrusy , crisp and light . the body was quite thin and watery with a highly over carbonated and airy mouthfeel . as much as i wanted to hate this beer , it was not as bad as i thought it would be . in fact , it was actually quite refreshing ( albeit overly sweet ) . i would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a light beer on a hot summer day or if you are a sorority girl seeking a quick buzz .'

S"i had quite the session with this brew after snorkeling in cozumel . the catamarran that took us out to the reef offered free beers and margaritas after the snorkeling tour , and the ride back to the cruise ship was about an hour , so although that 's not much time ... .they were free , so i super-sessioned after spending some time contemplation the first one . after repeated free-dives down thirty feet to the bottom crevices of the reef , i had a touch of the bends and i had to go back to my stateroom on the ship after dinner ... the combination of eye/ear pain and massive buzz was just too much . i got some good pictures of the rays and groupers though ! a - golden yellow and clear with a small cap of white fizz . no real head or lace , just a wispy haze on top of the brew . s - vibrant fruit and estery lager yeast . suprizingly assertive for the style , but it 's still a relitively thin nose . t - lightly fruity with some maple syrup sweetness ( cane sugar syrup ? ) . a biscuity and well built malt backbone makes this a well balanced and tasty brew . m - thicker than most macros , but still on the light side overall . moderate carbonation , firm mouthfeel , and quite a bit more structure than others of it 's kind . d - excellent . this is probably my favorite non-vienna style mexi-lager . head and shoulders above corona , sol , dos equis , ect ."

S'first time reviewing this one . have had it a number of times over the years . a : super dark brown . minimal white head . s : very dominating malt smell up front . some toffee in the back . t : dark malt city . brown sugar and hints of candy . m : excellent . med to heavy body . carbonation is perfect for this beer . d : very drinkable . the problem for me with bocks is that the malt can become so overpowering as to render the beer undrinkable . ayinger took it down a notch and it helps the overall drinkability . worth it for the plastic goat alone !'

S"served on-tap in a solo cup at new england brewing co. a : poured a very dark , almost black amber color with a fine head of loose carbonation which wisped away to nothing but a thin , sparse film . s : smells of toffee and coffee malts , an interesting sweet roasted aroma . t : the taste is semisweet and bitter up front , with a burnt coffee malt flavor running through the mid palate and finishing a tad tea-like and buttery sweet . very mild aftertaste and palate . m : mouthfeel is on the thin side and a little slick . the palate of flavors is very soft too , lending to a mild mouthfeel . d : not my favorite ale , but a unique beer nonetheless . it 's tailor-made for a session , as per the low abv . it does have a good flavor , but for being a mild ale , the taste would cloy and get to me after a while . i would put the raven haired mild in the category of beers you should try , but might not particularly like or stick to all night . jeff does some good work at bar , particularly the new hommobock , so be sure to sample others besides this mild ."

S'poured a deep reddish brown with an off-white head . smell reminded me of hickory . very woody , absolutely lovely . close your eyes , and you expect a sausage in the glass when you open them . the taste starts off very malty , but before the sweetness crescendos , the smoke kicks in and dries out your mouth . has a very dry finish , not quite astringent , just very very dry . this is a definite barbecue beer . give me a smoker , a couple pounds of red meat , and a keg of this stuff !'

S'presentation : as with all the schwelmer brews , this too arrives in a rather cool looking half-litre [ 1 pt 0.9 fl.oz . ] brown glass bottle which has a vertical neck label covering the steel wire which holds the red & white plastic flip top in place . front label is partly generic in nature and looks like the other offerings from schwelm . labeled as alt the unique hoppy altbier , brewed in accordance with the rheinheitsgebot of 1516 . the back label says best before end 88 10 57.im still trying very hard to work this calendar coding out . no listed strength . appearance : shining pellucid chestnut body with a vociferous creamy tan colored head . middling carbonation offers up some feedback when the glass is tilted but not much to shout about . nose : damp wood mixes with a wet pine chopping board sniff . malty aromas mingle with soiled jeans . strange . taste : soil laden fading malts have a light nutty feel . lightweight flavors are hard to break out . feels about as german as the french resistance . im afraid i just didnt get much from this alt . to me it tastes more like an average run-of-the-mill weak nutty brown ale . sehr forgetful , ya ! ? mouthfeel : light feel it flitters around like a cheap kite in a strong wind . weak and thin at times . it fails in the mouthfeel completely . drinkability : average drinker but it gets very boring.very quickly..i almost left the last third of this one ... overall : the last of the four schwelmers that i picked up from hollingshead deli in orange , ca , all cost $ 2.69 each . nothing earth shattering about this one , as with the bernstein it looks much better than it tastes..i wont be trying this one again , but at least i have another reusable flip-top bottle for my home-brewing pals .'

S'a : the beer is essentially jet black in color -- only some traces of amber are visible near the edge of the glass when it is held up to the light . it poured with a finger high creamy tan head that gradually faded away and left lacy patterns of bubbles covering the surface . s : there are strong aromas of phenols and roasted malts in the nose along with some notes of licorice and smoke . t : the taste has flavors of roasted malt , bitter coffee beans and licorice along with notes of smoke . m : it feels a bit shy of medium-bodied , smooth and slightly dry on the palate with a light to moderate amount of carbonation . o : the beer is very flavorful considering its low alcohol ; i could drink this all night long because it is very sessionable .'

S"i love the history behind this brew ; lovely when different fields of science come together . this beer tastes more like a south african honey wine mixed with some wheat/grains than a beer , but what a unique taste . this beer appears a bit cloudy with a soft golden color and just a bit of cream colored head that dissipates quickly . aromas of honey , grains , bread , and rice come to mind ; very unique . the taste is a blend of honey derived sweetness with starch derived bitterness that just rolls over the tongue and leaves behing some nice spice flavors . a bit too dry in the finish for it 's texture and components , especially for the alcohol content . the complexity of the flavors was just too much for me to crave more than one of these ."

S'got this on tap at duckworths in charlotte nc . pours an orangish amber body . thick 1/2 inch white foamy head . smells primarily of piney hops . some floral and citris undertones but mostly pine and grassy notes . slight tart finish . taste intensely of grassy and piney hops with an obvious alcohol pressence . small floral notes in background and an almost pilsner-like malt backbone . mouthfeel is stingingly sharp . only hop heads should enjoy this beer .'

S"poured from 12oz bottle . a- pours a golden amber clear color . one and a half finger white head that shows medium retention . light web lacing on the sides of the glass . s- light caramel malts and some toasted grains . plain and simple but the aroma is very faint and i had to almost bury my nose in the glass to find it . t- caramel malts in the front of the beer . a lot of metallic flavor in the middle kills off all other flavor . light bitterness in the backing of the beer . as the beer warms the front has more of a toasted grain presence with the caramel malts . m- lighter mouthfeel . carbonation is very high for the beer . light caramel malts left on the palate . some light alcohol and metallic flavor in the aftertaste . the flavors or lack their of make this beer light tasting . alcohol not very drying on the palate . d- the beer is light and pretty low on the flavor . the abv is not very high so this beer is easy drinking . not the best oktoberfest style beer but also not the worse i 've had . if this had a little more flavor this would be better ."

S"i 've had good luck with this brewery , and its `` extreme '' series of brews . maybe i should take up bungee jumping , or half-pipe skateboarding ... a - now that 's a head ! even a gentle pour from the bomber into a pint glass yields three fingers of frothy , meringue-looking foam . color is a pale , light copper , just a bit cloudy . s - can something smell mean ? my nose is trying to negotiate a bouquet of freshly-mowed lawn , rotten clementines and furniture polish . complex , in a multi-car accident sort of way . t - my first thought is kale - earthy , green and exceptionally bitter . a sharp astringency on the mid-palate ( hello , 8 % alcohol ) dissipates into a hop-fueled grapefruity punch right in the kisser . the finish is a bit rocky ; you sort of wait for the curve to level , but it does n't - it just sort of fades away like a punk rock beat forever echoing across your palate . a non-hop lover friend put it well : `` this must be what pine-sol tastes like . '' m - it 's bitter , really bitter . in fact , it 's almost hard to gauge the viscosity and mouthfeel due to the fact that your mouth is recovering from each sip . this is what i imagined when i first read the label for stone ruination ; in fact , i hereby declare my palate shot . d - i absolutely could not drink more than one of these . high alcohol and extreme bitterness make drinking this beer a lot like eating a live guppy on a dare : you fake a smile , mutter `` it was n't that bad '' and make secret mental notes about where your limits really lie . if you remember that part in `` tombstone '' where johnny ringo yells `` do n't any of you have the guts to play for blood ? '' and doc holiday steps out and says `` i 'm your huckleberry - that 's just my game , '' that moment is this beer personified . in all seriousness , this was the first of rock art 's beers that lived up to the `` i 'd turn back if i was you '' label . if you 're a fan of shocking your palate , and indeed establishing just how much is too much from a beer , give this esb3 a try . much like the aforementioned bungee jump , it 's something you are glad you did , but it 's not like you 're hurrying to get back in line and do it again ."

S"poured from a 12 oz bottle . the last one that i 've been saving . its been cellaring since august . poured into a pint . a - pours a hazy deep golden color . since it was cellaring for so long there is a ton of sediment in there from the swirl . very hazy . the carbonation was quick to dissipate , leaving only a film on top . a load of yeast settled out in the glass . s - sweet yeasty . not sure if thats a viable description , but thats what hits me . mostly a yeast nose , but i feel like its backed up with a scent of cloves and malt . t - starts off with a very sweet malty flavor . very alcoholic - lots of bite . finishes off with a nice yeast flavor . the coriander and orange peel for the style are very muted . m - its creamy and thick . its surely a high grav beer . interesting adaptation of the style . d - its not very filling , which would make this fit the concept of an easy summer drinker . but the alcoholic flavors and high abv would probably wear on me in a session . that is somewhat moot with the availability of this beer . this really is n't a witbier to me . but , i understand its a special beer which they are trying something different . all and all pretty good ."

S"light golden color with a sparse head and a disturbing amount of protein particulate matter in the otherwise clear liquid . smells of sweet apple cider mildly and some alcohol . tastes of candy sugar and raisins . i get no rye bitterness and the overall color , taste , and smell is much closer to an american/belgian triple than anything having to do with either rye or barleywine . it 's good for what it is but the bottle is misleading . round and soft in the middle with spikey carbonation around the edges in the mouth . overall a pleasant experience as with any fine belgian . drinkability - i will suffer through this one . not that it 's all that bad , i just would have preferred a 12oz bottle or someone to split this one with . perhaps it will improve with time . i will likely buy just one or two more of these for nostalgia since it is a one time brew but if i miss it i 'd be ok with that too ."

S'tried this before , and have had a can sitting in the fridge waiting to do a review . then got it as an extra from womencantsail today , so i figured it was a good time to do it . a : large frothy big bubbled 2 finger head rises over the very dark but somewhat clear brown color . n : brown sugar and dark malts dominate the nose . a little hop bitterness is there , as well as some dark fruits , plum , raisin . lots of caramelized brown sugar . t : starts with lots of sweet dark malts . a chewy malt flavor with some light roast , belgian malts , and caramel malt . lots of dark fruits , raisin , plum , fig , etc . again tons of caramelized brown sugar comes through . a touch of hop bitterness . it gets a very slight boozy quality but hides the 8.5 % well . m : decent body and good carbonation . f : finishes still pretty sweet with more brown sugar and fruit . some strange bitterness comes through on the finish too , but its a somewhat unpleasant bitterness . the sweetness , syrup , and brown sugar never wants to go away . that is probably the only downfall of this beer . i wonder if it will mellow as it ages . with how sweet it is , it makes it a tough drink actually .'

S"just finished a great dinner and decided to dig around the old fridge , pulled this guy out . cost $ 2.50 for the pint sized bottle . pours into an aventinus glass with blonde on blonde filling the space in the background . initial pour leaves a nice head , but it falls quickly to what looks like a calm and murky pond . no lacing and a barely noticeable wine rim around the edges . its autumn brown and the bubbles hug the glass where it protrudes out - waiting for their turn to blast off towards the light above . bubbles exploding where liquid meets air replicating a really poorly trained firing squad . the base has an orangish yellow tinge to it , and at the very bottom it is almost clear with more bubbles popping and locking . nice looking for sure , but would love the head to stick around for at least a bit . smells a bit musty , and the candy sweetness jumps upward with a nice little effort . the wheat is very present , and i get all the typical hefe smells of spices , banana , clove , etc . maybe it is too cold , maybe it is the fact we just cooked up some delicious sweet pepper and vinegar pork chops - but the taste glides off the palate very quickly . the malt really comes out in the taste , and it is extremely true to the style - with very strong bazooka joe bubble gum flavors . nice carbonation , just wish it had more body . it does n't explode like i wish it would - if that makes sense . which is weird , because even now - 20 minutes after opening the bottle bubbles are still torpedoing towards through the beer for a chance at the surface . its definitely drinkable , if not almost a bit too watery . all in all , a good example of the style and at $ 2.50 a pint at retail - you just ca n't go wrong ."

S"i never realized this was considered and apa until now . what once was a leading beer in a piss-poor category now becomes a sub-par beer in a good beer category . this is definitly much better than mr . bud mcmiller , but its not going to fare well against some good apa 's . anyways , i 'll take it for what its worth . not a bad beer here , pretty average tasting . i 've had much better beers io my day , but i 've also had much worse . this is actually a very easy drinker . i could down several of these with ease and without choking them down and cussing myself out for resorting to it again like i would with busch light or something . nothing all that special , but not a bad beer at all for the price . probably would make a great beer to introduce to your thick-headed bud light buddy ."

S"into a pint glass , pours a dark dark brown , small head shrinking to nothing , no lacing , kind of boring . the aroma is also minimal , some standard porter qualities , the 'cocoa ' brings some odd quality to it . same with the taste , boring , artificial , and otherwise unappealing . i try not to write reviews simply giving a bad critique without any specifics , but i really could n't get anything specific out of this , kind of just a vague ish . not a fan ."

S"aroma here is of thick , grapefruit hops . a lot of them . not surprising for style at all . not offputting though . appears blonde , but hazy . this beer is one of the hoppiest beers i have ever tried , to be honest . what starts as a moderate hop bite initially quickly escalates into one of the deepest , longest grapefruit hop assault on the taste buds . the intensity literally made my eyes open . the staying power after the swallow is pretty legendary too . you wo n't forget what type of beer you 're drinking soon . i also percept the booziness in the finish as well . after a while , i had to stop drinking because i was getting a bit of heartburn from it . i suppose hoppiness is definitely what they were going for , but this went to the point where it was difficult to choke down . kudos for brewing a memorable beer , though ."

S"appearance : 22oz bottle poured into sam adams `` perfect pint '' . colour is a very pale amber , no visible carbonation , finger-thick head quickly fades away to a thin white film leaving pretty even lacing around the rim . smell : moderate citrus , some hopes and malt . not very strong . taste : overall , very light flavours of bready malts , citrus , and just a hint of hops . there is a flavour i ca n't seem to identify , it almost reminds me of sake . mouthfeel : heavily carbonated , very light and `` fluffy '' if i may . finishes a little sticky . overall : i regret not having this brew with food . it is summertime right now so it feels fantastic to drinka beer as light as this one . definitely one of the odder tasting brews i 've had . it 's good , though ."

S'vintage 2003 poured this baby into a wine glass . not alot of head to this thing but the look is serious-thick , almost syrupy chestnut brown with amber tones and orange hues . very alcoholic with fruity esters rising to the surface-rum , fruitcake , brandy , orange , spice-very deep and complex aromas . the mouthfeel is large-big-time ! like one reviewer described it-a big zinfandel , a chewy california cabernet with a shot of cognac dropped in for good measure . this baby is thick ! loads of complex flavors much like a fine port-dried fruits , chocolate , sweet roasted nutty flavors , dark , bitter espresso tones . to put it mildly , this is a monster , and one to sip , buy more of , save and sip again another cold blustery night . wow !'

S'appearance=looks like a glass of apple cider with a decently thick head that disappears quickly into nothing with no lacing . s=cranberrys factor in highly as expected but also includes honey and a slight hint of alcohol . not bad . taste and mouthfeel=this gives lambics a bad name . i see that it is not classified as such on this site ( nor should it be ) but since samuel adams uses this label prominently , i will review it against such . this is awful . rather than the sourness of a great cantillon or the sweetness of a good lindemans , this is just sam adams lager mixed with cranberry juice and maple syrup . no sweetness or sourness to speak of . thin bodied with moderate to high carbonation . the juice comes across as more watering down the lager than enhancing it . drinkability..while this goes down easy , i will probably only drink it again to finish off my supply from the holiday sampler .'

S"did n't think i would easily find a hawaiian beer , but luckily i did while in colorado . for a lager it looks on point - poured clear yellow with a large head . lacing and some retention . light malty smell with a minor hop nose . great for the style of beer it is . light malty flavor with a slighty bitter finish . light body . great sensations on the tip of my tongue and the rear of my mouth . great beer for a summer day . i could see myself enjoying these beers and lounging outside . message in my bottle cap : `` aloha goodbye ''"

S"this case of beer caught my eye at sam 's club because of it 's low cost and the fact the beer is advertised as a small batch craft brew . i love trying new craft beers , so i thought `` why not '' ! color - the beer poured crystal clear with a very light amber tone . medium off-white head dissolved quickly with no lacing . aroma - sweet malty scent with a hint of light hops . mouthfeel - pretty heavily carbonated . crisp and very easy to drink . flavor - pretty light inital taste . sweet but watery . the flavor really kicks in once it hits the back of your pallet . malty brown sugar is present , along with a very mild trace of hops . for an amber , this beer is very easy to drink . it 's a bit light for my taste , at least if i was in the mood for an amber . although it tastes like an amber , it drinks like a red lager . will do well on a hot day ."

S"i received bottles from beerbeagle , viggo and scoobydank . thanks for this , guys ! split it with johnmichaelsen last night . a : jet black with an inch-thick dark brown head . looks very impressive with some lacing . s : spicy hops right out of the gate , spicy enough to make me think of a papad ( matpe bean flour and black pepper roasted together ) . definitely pine-like in hop character . dark bitter chocolate in the back with a lot of roasted malt aroma , roasted and acridly bitter . the hops lend a unique twist to this beer but there is n't enough of a backbone to pull this off . t : opens up way too sweet , artificially so ( is this beer approved for phenylketonurics ? ) , malted milk balls . hops come through with a piney bitterness but not enough to balance the sweetness . at the risk of belaboring a point , this beer is all too sweet , lacking in any real complexity . in addition , there 's a rather strange acrid malt bitterness that just does not work m : light in body , almost too light . carbonation is good but the finish is too sweet for my liking . d : poor , i 'm having a hard time finishing this . in fact , i could n't finish the 8-10oz i poured for myself . notes : i really wanted to like this beer but it 's an imperial stout in the vein of the sweeter ones - dwf wws , dark horizon ( both beers being superior ) and in some respects , the mikkeller black . if you like these beers , you 'll go apeshit over this but honestly , i 'm not really a fan ."

S"appearance : this was an unassuming golden-amber beer that had a light haze . an almost white , coarse , fizzy head rose two fingers high with some coaxing and thinned out quickly . there was no lacing . smell : the aromas were very light . a little bit of caramel , roasted malt , and cracker . there was also a hint of fruitiness . no hops on the nose at all which was odd , considering that this was a pale ale . mouthfeel : medium-thin bodied with a lot of bite . taste : a little bit of sweet and roasted malts came through in this beer , but that was the extent of the `` good '' flavors . the overriding taste was an acidic bite that faded into a very unnatural and sharp tasting bitterness . very disappointing , but that 's what i have come to expect from spanish peaks ."

S"from the ceramic bottle with stopper , exp date 09/11/11 . appearance : pours golden yellow with fairly vigorous head that resembles wet foam . dissipates to 1/3 of it 's full size within 2 minutes , leaves little lacing . fairly hazy , not sure if this is very tiny sediment as it 's all uniform . ( hazy enough that you can not see your hand through the glass . smell : honey , with touch of grain at the end . taste : hard to identify at first due to harsh carbonation . once it setles , a crisp sweet honey finishing with a lasting dry hoppy flavor . the alcohol starts to creep up at this point , though . mouthfeel : very carbonated at first pour , once it settles down it gets better . drinkability : i had a really hard time with this beer at first . again , it 's worth waiting for things to subside before going in . the carbonation made it difficult to get down , and fills you up very quickly . once the carbonation eases , it 's crisp and fairly refreshing ( though at this point the temperature may cause the alcohol to show itself ) . i honestly had to take a break before i could finish , as the first taste left a bad impression . this is my first time dealing with a ceramic bottled beer , as well as something calling itself `` grand reserve , '' so the initial impressions i had may just be a first time folly . once the beer had time to come up in temperature ( had it in the fridge overnight ) , it became more drinkable , and actually pretty enjoyable . at $ 7 for 16oz , it is n't necessarily a bad buy , but still makes it a tough recommendation ."

S'22 ounce bottle received in a trade with bassmantin , thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this rare treat , split with my buddy today after a long horrible day at work for both of us , poured into my chimay goblet a-medium orange with some brown and red highlights , not near as dark as you would think it is judging by its high abv , small 1/4 inch bubbly white head , not much retention , some lacing only at the beginning s-tons of apples , sweet malt , belgian yeast , sugar , sour candy , dates , figs , prunes , dates , raisins , plums , pommegranates , toffee , lots of booze , bananas , bubble gum , black cherries , and oranges t-started off tasting sweet but the big alcohol flavor did not attack until later , lots of dark fruit at the beginning , then some spiciness in the middle , followed by a huge boozy finish , got progressively harder to drink as it got warmer , super hot taste that did not lack any flavor , tons of granny smith apples and caramel malt towards the end , hard to drink the eight ounces or so i poured into my glass , like nothing else i have had m-spicy , hot , sweet , strong , and malty mouthfeel all at once , do not know how else to describe it , lots of alcohol on the tongue , thick body for its color , could have probably used some more carbonation d-could have never drank this bottle by myself , abv is a whopping fifteen percent and you can certainly taste it , not smooth and gives new definition to a sipper , can not imagine anybody polishing one of these off on their own needed try this as soon as i saw it was bottled , been in my cellar for close to six months and finally decided to pop it tonight , strongest tasting beer of this style i have ever had , would try again , could possibly get better after a year or two of aging , recommended'

S'live review . poured from the 1 pint , 6 fl . oz . bottle that i bought at world wines & liquor a few weeks ago for $ 4.99 into a clean , clear pint glass . batch no . 1 printed on the bottom back of the label but no observed best by date . a silky smooth medium brown one inch head over a very dark brown body that glows a great shade of mahogany in front of direct light . i really like this look and particularly that silky smooth head that sticks to the inside of the glass after repeated sips . 4.5 s chocolate , dark roast malt and interesting spicing present themselves in various levels with repeated sniffs . the chocolate is of the dark chocolate variety . interesting and inticing . 4.5 t wow , a great spectrum of tastes here that i did not necessarily think would all work like they do . the dark roast malt , the chocolate nips and , to a lesser extent , the spicing conspire to make an interesting , complex tasting beer that i really think rivals some of the most famous beers like founders breakfast stout and others like it . 4.5 m it is a really big beer with all of those competing tastes but there is a nice smoothness derived from that smooth head . the mouthfeel and nothing if not interesting and challenging . 4.5 d/o i wont have any problem finishing the bomber ( for the sake of research of course ) but this is one big beer and the relatively high abv of 8.5 % means that i would not be reaching for a second one of these . overall this is a big , interesting , challenging beer whose many tastes compete for your attention and succeeds in nearly every way . bravo ! 3.5'

S"poured into a snifter . sticker on bottle says bottled in 1999 . absolutele no head . a few bubbles . maroon , and looks semi see through on the edges . smells of dark fruits , caramel , and brown sugar . some cork , and perhaps a chalkiness ? tart and chalky . some dark fruits and light caramel . smoke and tobacco . cooking wine , chalk and cork . honestly , this is probably gon na be a drain pour . zero carbonation . mouthfeel is slick and full bodied without being syrupy at all . i ca n't drink more than a sip of this . i do n't really get this beer . i 've had plenty of old ales i like , but this is beyond my understanding . if that 's what happens to old ales after prolonged aging . i 'm not trying to age any old ales for too long . the cork was super hard to get out too ."

S'salmon-colored cloudy brew forms a 3 finger white head with a rose tinge , meringue peaks , and delicate lace . carbonation is moderate with medium sized bubbles . adding the yeast makes it quite scummy looking , like grapefruit-banana juice . aroma has a bavarian wheat character with subtle hints of raspberries and noticeable hops . mouthfeel is crisp and spritzy with a light body . taste starts off with some prominent flavor hops , fades into a crisp wheat character , followed by a delicate raspberry touch , and ending in a mild bittering hop profile . the ending is very clean and light , with a excellent wet mouthfeel akin to mineralized water . nice , but i would prefer a little more raspberry in the profile , with a touch more sweetness to accentuate it .'

S"philadelphia brewing company 's kenzinger is a decent beer for what it 's worth , but does n't really stand up next to other pale ales that are out there . seems a bit grainy , so much so that i almost felt like i could taste more malt than hops , which for me , defeats the point of it being a pale ale . could use a bit more hops to balance things out . color and aroma are good , and overall , i could drink a few of these in one sitting , but would n't over the choice of a better pale ale if available ."

S"appearance : poured into a glass : a rich golden-brown with a nice thick foam head . looks very appealing , especially when the light hits the glass just right . mild lacing . taste : a mild onset of flavors : a hint of malt and a small punch of hops . the first few sips with head are the most enjoyable , as you get a creamy splash combined with the hop flavor . i 've had many pale ales , and this is among the weakest . i really like a very strong pale ale , and i was rather disappointed . mouthfeel : smooth but unassuming ... goes down a little too easy . drinkability : this beer has a high drinkability because its flavor is not overpowering . i found drinking several while mixing music was all too easy . this is a reasonably priced beer found at kroger ... if you 're looking for a nonchalant pale ale to drink during a card game or a few burgers than this is one to consider ."

S"pours a light cloudy amber with virtually no head . unimpressive . hops completely dominate the nose ; orange zest , grapefruit , and pine . tons of pine and bitter grapefruit rind on top of some toffee sweetness , i would n't say balanced but it is n't completely one-sided either . alcohol and spice come through in the finish . it has a medium body but feels quite syrupy due to the very low level of carbonation . i am wondering whether this is a bad bottle as it is pretty much flat , which severely detracts from the drinkabilty and overall enjoyment of this aromatic brew . as it warms alcoholic heat really comes through in the finish making it even harder to finish the bomber"

S"sampling # 2 of the series . picked up in the mixed pack from arctic liqours in steamboat , co. around $ 10 if i 'm not mistaken . a : hazy amber , stark white head , great retention , and pretty fair lacing as well . head is pretty dense and rocky as well . nice looking witbier . s : musky wheat malts , fruity , cranberries do n't come out and smack ya in the face , but they are there . slightly spicy on the yeast end of it . ca n't really pick up a whole lot , but it smells pretty nice . t : a lot more tart than the nose had suggested , definitely grainy , this one really lingers in the mouth . cranberries give just a hint of tart , and the rest is pretty much a traditional wheat beer . slightly tangy wheat malt , and a little bit of spice in there as well . some bananas and citrus towards the end as well . not too bad . m : light in the mouth , pretty crisp as well , and dry , begs for another drink . d : meh , it 's tasty , but i do n't think i 'll open the second one . nice beer , but just not something i 'd want to drink a whole lot of ."

S'this one actually produces a thin , spongy head with some lacing . it is light transparent urine in color and has the faintest aroma of peaches . biting astringincy brings in soapy , yeasty , and slight apple suggestions . ok but funky and the mouthfeel really stings like a bitch . this is way over carbonated .'

S'i am sampling this beer at room temp in a small tumbler glass . not really appropriate glassware , but i am in a hotel and this is what ive got . the beer pours a hazy gold color with some floaties . the .5cm bleached white head foams up and fades rather quickly to an edge layer . aroma is citrusy sweet with oranges dominant mixing with coriander and lemon and some biscuity yeast hints . first sip reveals a lite body and very fine spacious carbonation . flavor is sweet and citrusy with orange and coriander again . overall fairly mild taste with just a hint of crisp lemon on the finish . this is a very drinkable beer and was quite tasty after a day of snorkelling on great barrier reef .'

S"poured in american pint glass , according to directions . very pale yellow color , appropriately similar to wheat , but almost foggy ; like the liquid left over after cooking seafood . disappointing head that disappeared immediately , though it had nice coloration . creamy in texture , though not very full bodied . clean flavour , sweet and well-rounded , with a hint of faint bitterness in the middle . finishes well without leaving an aftertaste ; cleanses the palate . would n't reccommend for heavier foods , but excellent to pair with lighter fare"

S"served in an imperial pint glass at just over fridge temperature . purchased at ramsey liquors . 16.9 oz . bottle , no freshness date . appearance- looks like fuller 's esb 's brother ... rich amber hue with a great , four-finger bone white crown that hisses and pops for minutes . no lacing , but the head is nice even when the ride is over . smell- caramel malt and a sweet , alcohol-tinged toffiness come out of the beer first . a dark fruit bready character emanates soon after , and remains for the duration . taste- first , the caramel malt notes make their presence known ... then the bready yeastiness , then a mild and short hop finish that leaves the mouth dry . not as balanced and well crafted as fuller 's ( the benchmark , imo ) but the elements are there . unfortunately , i swirled and emptied the bottle into my glass which imparted a sour-ish , very detracting smell and flavor . if you try this , take my word for it and leave the last 2 oz . for the sink . mouthfeel/drinkability- very light and , frankly , boring . for an esb , i want super-sessionable drinkability with active and rolling mouthfeel . this falls flat big time in the mouth and because of the harsh , sour notes in the taste , i could n't do this again . pass this one up in favor of some local bitters , if you 're from the states of course ."

S'ok , first review under the new user name . first one of the year . shared a bomber from bev 4 less purchased first week of november , into a duvel tulip . beautiful mocha head , one fingered that soon vanished to a ring that lasted almost to the end . one could make out faint hints of mahogany brown in the blackness that let no light through . barrel first than coffee in the nose and taste . not being a bourbon or coffee drinker these notes were more than present for me . as it warms a sweeter , and as some have said , a green apple like taste competes with the coffee and barrel . i would have liked a bit thicker mouth feel , might have carried the sweetness a bit more rather than the more acid like fruit highlights . would i drink more than half a bomber of this at a sitting ? not at this time . but i have one in the cellar and will check back in a year . and might pick up one more only because alpine is 8 miles from my home . lol'

S"presentation : 24oz gren pop-top bottle with classic heine label appearance : bright gold beer with stark white cap which slowly fades to a soapy film ; nice lazy carbonation smell : a big ole kick of skunk right off the bat ; i expected this . after a few minutes of breathing , however , the skunk subsides radically , and the aromas are of simple sweet cereal grains , very light sweet malt , and grassy hops . nothing bad , but pretty standard for the style . taste : fairly juicy and fruity up front , backed with light cereal grains and a bit of metallic bitterness on the finish . ends medium-dry . nothing offensive , but not much of anything going on here either . mouthfeel : fairly light-bodied drinkability : pretty high conclusion : this is n't all that bad ; it 's good for washing down a good pizza as i 'm currently doing ; this is better than the typical bmc lager , but i would n't buy this to drink on its own ."

S"i poured it into a chilled pint glass . it is a beautiful , coppery golden brown color with an clear , bubbly body . it was a 22oz . bottle , so when i refilled my pint , some small yeast chunks fell into the glass . the head is just awesome . it poured a thick , 1.5 finger , creamy , popcorn , cloud-like head that would just not go away . full of peaks and canyons , incredibly interesting . it almost looked like someone floated a thick rice cake on top of the glass , and it was a good thing . i have never seen anything like it . for appearance , it gets a 5+++ . the smell is a well-balanced combination of wheat , fruit , chocolate , and alcohol . the taste is just so good . i really had a hard time not finishing the beer before finishing this review . it starts a little sour , then an overwhelming combination of apples , citrus , chocolate , hops , giving way to a nice bitter kick and a strong , yet well-balanced alcohol finish . i have never had a chocolate tasting ipa before . also , for some reason , the flavor of the beer is just so well-defined and unique , it 's like it has always been there , and i am just now fortunate enough to have discovered it . to quote the bottle , `` it 's pretty awesome . '' i speculate that it will be on tap at my wedding ."

S'oh white birch , how you make me smile and frown . you have some beers that are outstanding and then you have some that are disgusting . this is one of the bad ones . the appearance is a nice straw color , but a little more golden than the usual berliner weisse . it pours a nice one finger white head that leaves after a few seconds . cloudy milky hazy-ness that looks a little off . the smell is of sulfur and eggs . has some acidic bug smell , probably more pedio than anything , but its hard to tell with the sulfur . the taste has an off egg flavor that is due to an infection of the bad kind . it has a thick mouthfeel that is uncharacteristic of many berliner weisse . the off flavors are subtle , but are the backbone of a mediocre lactobacillus flavor that makes me want much more . the mouthfeel coats the palate with a bit of cheese , thanks lacto ! it is fairly crisp with the funk character adding some complexity . it was barely drinkable , and overall i am not impressed . j'

S"a : certainly amber - a nice crisp pour , topped with a wonderfully creamy and rolling head . s : subtle , lightly toasted malts . almost a hint of fruitiness . biscuit . t : a slightly sweet maltiness . quite light , a bit of biscuit , nothing too overdone , but enough flavour to offer a bit of character m + d : a lighter body , maybe a bit thin . carbonation is a little soft which makes it come across as a bit thin ( though it does have a little bite right off the tip of the tongue ) . with that mellowing carbonation , it 's an incredibly easy drinker , though , and one that could be easy sucked back all afternoon . this is what i 'd consider an ideal `` lawnmower beer .

( eighteen percent abv you say ? i believe it ! . ) the feel is full bodied with a sherry sweet finish . this is definitely pushing things to an extreme . it 's very enjoyable if sipped at a relaxed pace . i 'm glad i got to try it , but at $ 9.75 for 12 ounces from the discount store i wo n't be returning to it often ."

S"found this one while browsing for new beers to try . it 's my cousin 's favorite , and he was very disappointed when i informed him that this one was retired . funnily enough , the moment i told him that , we stumbled upon several six packs of this one . the bottle says it expired in august of 07 , so this one might not be as good as it would be back when it was still being made . a - a simple orange-ish brown amber color that looks pretty clear . very little head dissipating into nothing . s - an interesting citrus and vegetal aroma with the standard fare of yeast and hops . very light on the hops . t - the hops taste is there , but lacks a lot of the typical hoppy bitterness . it could be the fact that it 's past its prime , but i 'm not getting a lot of complexity here . the aftertaste is where i 'm getting a lot of citrus , and even something slightly buttery . intriguing . m - watery , but inoffensive . d - if this was still available in fresh six-packs , i 'd be able to knock back dozens of these . it almost feels like i 'm doing this dead recipe a disservice by reviewing a sample that 's past its 'drink by ' date , but i had to put my cousin 's enthusiasm for this one to the test . i do n't really see what he sees in this one , but it 's perfectly drinkable . i just hope i did n't do my stomach a disservice with this review ."

S'bottle into red wine glass . thanks again to jeff ( mnjeff ) for the sample ! pours impenetrable black , with almost no visible carbonation , just a thin soapy head . nose is roasty , with a big , hoppy acidity on top of everything . lots of citrus , chocolate , coffee ... really , really hoppy for an ris . taste is excellent . starts off with a big dose of bright , hoppy citrus acidity , bit of pine , borne on the back of a huge , chocolatey malt body with nice coffee bite . significant resiny hop bitterness lingers on the palate , more of that big , bright citrusy acidity , this time with a stout , roasty counterpart . reminiscent of night stalker , smutty is - well done . i can see why this is such a huge favorite to age . mouthfeel is great - so smooth and creamy , a light undercurrent of carbonation that lets the acidity from the hops do a lot of the work . massive body is bigger than full . drinkability is mainly hurt by just how massively hoppy this beer is . big , big bitterness works against that aspect . still , a tasty treat .'

S"thanks to flandersned for this , one of two surviving bottles from an epic springtime trade . pop . and then there was one . pour is dark brown with a reddish stain , close to zero carbonation . nose is overdose of sweet malting , with twinges of the raisins , caramel , brown sugar . marvelous . not a raisin fan as food ( what a waste of grapes ! ) but it sets off & complements the malt here . the wizard does n't get that ratio right in the mouth . the raisins are n't just an addition , i believe the entire beer might have been made with a mash of raisins - no malt or hops or water necessary . yikes . all the gorgeous subtlety in the nose is obliterated in a tornadic blast of raisin . ca n't even detect the malt base . the minimal carbonation vanishes quickly , leaving a big , heavy raisin puree . not very appealing . the smell on this brew is unique & lovely , but the taste corkscrews close to vile territory . sadly , this beer actively repulses me ."

S"for me , this scores `` 4.0 - good '' in all but one category . nice , dark golden/amber color . smells nicely of citrus and pine hops . tastes of honey , pine , and slight caramel . clean flavor with no imbalance or `` off '' tastes . mouthfeel is rich and rewarding . drinkability gets a 3.0 because it is strong stuff at 7.1 % ( that 's what my label says ) . three or four of these in succession and you 're going to be on your way to being tanked . also , the sweetness might get a bit cloying after a few . but , to have one or two of these is fine idea . good representation of an ipa , and a very good beer overall ."

S'a : golden amber , with a light fluffy head . the head dissipated quickly with very little lacing . s : flowery , citrus , with some pine hoppiness . i got a slight smell brown sugar . t : really not much going on here . some bittering hops , and a touch of malt . leaves a slight hint of pine after you swallow . kind of lacking . m : thin and slightly watery . d : i actually think that this beer is quite drinkable . it is well balanced and goes down smooth . it also gives you the nice flowery bitter taste you would expect from an ipa . while , in my opinion , not the best ipa i have had it really is balanced and drinkable . i could sit down at a bar and order a few of these during a happy hour and be fine with it .'

S"on tap at rfd in dc today . the beer pours the expected blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing . the nose is impressive , with coffee grounds , dark chocolate , licorise , and some noticeable underlying hoppy bitterness . as a result , there 's a very impressive sweet and bitter aroma profile going on . the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this complex beer , though i thought it was dominated by flavors of licorise , dark chocolate and cherry vanilla . still , what 's really striking is the underlying hoppy bitterness in this beer , which counters the considerable sweetness in this beer rather well . mouthfeel is full bodied , with a long sweet and bitter finish . drinkability is n't bad , though the obvious high alcohol , sweetness and licorise detract just a bit . still , while this beer is very much a sipper , it 's nevertheless quite impressive and delicious ... . a very easy to appreciate and enjoy beer from great divide . excellent !"

S'had this on tap at a local pub . the taste of this brew is decent as well as the color . this the mouthfeel is a little weak . its a lot like a blue moon . a cheap brew with a decent taste . the beer is pretty drinkable but its just looks okay . its just a fun beer overall this is a cheap and tastey brew .'

S"cloudy and orange like deadish fire embers , big majestic head that settles with three-dimensional lacing in chunks and clumps all about the glass . nose is unexpected.. a familiar honey scent of pils malts . this mixes with a slight hint of bready peppermint and fresh hops . double ipa ? dunno.. maybe a rhode island double ipa . initially sharply bitter , sickly sweet syrupy feel and a sourish yeast flavor give this the feel of high-octane malt liquor . finish is very hoppy in a rough , dirty way . another example of beer that tastes like a clump of grass with the mud-covered roots attached . part of the foul bitterness here is reminiscent of dairy.. like slightly-spoiled milk . at 56 ibu 's , there must be a significant amount of hops- none of which are really tasted here due to the abrasive jolt the beer delivers . you can feel them.. the bitterness , the rough gristle sticking to your cheek walls . but i 'd rather taste . finish is all about an unflavored alcohol heat ... think vodka . not too drinkable , not too enjoyable . not a double ipa . not something i would repeat ."

S"on tap at the brewery , reviewed from notes . a - pours a pale copper , two shades from straw . lighter than the pale ale , oddly . thick white head leaves sheets of lacing behind . s - mostly bright fruits , apricot & mango . some toasted grain . a bit of grass in the back . where are the hops ? t - more tropical fruitiness . some herb and grass lost in the back end . m - almost as light as the blonde . carbonation is super tight . very bright & quick finish . d - high , for a pale ale . the website describes this as their `` hop monster '' , which is interesting , considering i had to try really hard to find the hops at all . if this were labeled a pale ale , i 'd have gone with it . but an ipa ? i think not ."

S"750ml . in my ommegang 10th anniversary glass . first serving of the night . a : cork pops gently . no foaming . pours slightly hazy , just a couple shades lighter than aber . head is fluffy , with some bigger bubbles on the sides . about 1.5 '' with decent retention . s : sugar daddies , maybe a little mustard , initially a peppercorn or seasoned meat note that really sticks itself out there -- lamb or something ? very unique and very complex . this one smells pretty amazing . t/m/d : rich and a little cloying , even in the finish ( ! ) but definitely not bad -- they should consider smaller bottles of this one . it 's a little syrupy , and the yarrow seems to actually make the alcohol more noticeable , and its scent dominates the start of each sip -- very interesting . this one actually seems like a good candidate to match to a lot of foods . overall , highly recommended merely for the uniqueness factor . this one is worth trying . congrats to allagash on a new brewery . i will continue to try their tribute and barrel aged lines , but i wish they 'd make some darker brews ."

S"single 12oz bottle for $ 2.00 at barb 's beer emporium in concord , nh . bottled on date of 033110 ( march 31 , 2010 ) stamped into the label . served cold in a chilled pint glass . i did n't notice this is a diet beer until i went to open it up and fully read the label for the first time ( to me , redhook + seasonal = buy ... it 's an instinctive reaction ) . i 'll try to be impartial . a : moderate pour gives a big 2 '' of fizzy head that threatens to overflow the glass . there obviously is n't any alcohol in there to keep it down . ( dammit , sorry , forgot about the whole impartiality thing ... ) it settles to a fairly thick and stable layer on top of a crystal clear yellow brew . s : thick nose of caramel/ toffee , in a blind smelling i 'd swear it was twice as dark as it is . some acidic and astringent lemon rind cuts through cleanly . a hint of skunk . t/m : very thin and light , buttery toffee ( diacetyl ) rather than caramel , with a citrus edge . in a blind tasting this is where i would call it out as being a diet beer ... really thin and watery . faint lemon and grapefruit lingering in the soft finish . d : light , thin , watery . easily chuggable , i could drink a bathtub full of it . summary : if this is billed as diet beer , as it is ( if you take the time to read the label ) , then it 's a pretty good alternative to real beer . if billed as a real beer ( as the label tries to hide ) , then it falls flat . i guess it all depends on if you notice the small print on the side of the label ."

S"definitely an above average apa . app : poured an orange amber with a smallish white head , just a little bit hazy . carbonation looked ample and the head had decent retention , just a little too much haze in the body . smell : some piney and somewhat citrusy hop character took over the nose . it was a little more complex than i anticipated as the malt background was also evident . taste : again the piney hops with a little bit of citrus ( not quite grapefruit ) was largely present , but as it warmed many layers of malt came out from biscuity to grainy ( like a handful of kilned pale malt ) . the flavors mixed quite well and the hops always kept up with the changing malt character . mouthfeel : i found this to be very balanced with a deep hop bitterness and the sweetness of the malt . the carbonation , which was on the heavy side , took off some of the bitterness . it felt right on the palate . drinkability : it tasted good and definitely had great mouthfeel , but with all the other apa 's out there , this one did n't stand out to make me want to have more . i 'm glad i tried it , but it still is rather average . and because my favorite styles are maltier and darker , this had the regular apa effect of becoming a little boring by the last few sips ."

S"12oz . bottled february 3rd , 2010 , poured into my fff 's imperial pint ... pours a thick orange/amber color , very hazy , with a one finger white head ... leaves a cap of white haze on top of the beer and a little bit of lacing down the glass ... smell is sweet with a bit of spice coming from the heavy bourbon aromas ... definitely some syrup in there as well as a somewhat woody scent ... whoah ... boozy , too boozy ! gon na let it warm a bit ... a little warmer now , a little more complexity , but still lots a bourbon . the first sip almost instantly gave me heartburn from the booze , the second sip was more bearable ... and i think i am starting to like it . sweet , vanilla and some syrup ... tastes like an alcoholic breakfast . overall pretty good , but a bit too much alcohol burn for my tastes ... maybe some time will mellow this one out ... mouthfeel is thick and creamy , very coating of the palette . sticky and lingering . too much booze though ... definitely a sipper and something to savor ... definitely not drinking more than one of these at a time ... gon na give my other bottles some time before i revisit this one ..."

S'please put this in a keg and serve it to college students , this beer is not worth the 6 bucks unless you are drinking several pints . bitter after taste and flavorless , great mouth feel , very carbonated just like all the other american light beers . good clear color almost like water ...'

S'glowing , golden yellow topped with a cheerful head of white . summer in a glass . cloudy and bubbly . just looks cold and refreshing . very simple malt nose with highlights of bread . just a touch of hops to clean out the nostrils . light and sweet corn malt . a bit of astringent hop flavor . light in the mouth and finishes clean . very easy to drink on a warm summer day sitting in the shade . wish i had this last night for the thunderstorm , but i think it pairs better with a sunny day .'

S"i remember drinking this beer during a port call in hurghada , egypt in 1991 during desert storm . my carrier made a port call after over 110 days at sea nad this was the only beer available , so after all that time it was definitely welcome . there was a rumour passed by the military to avoid the non-export as it had formaldehyde . in retrospect it was pretty unremarkable . my most overwhelming memory is the ride back on the liberty boat . whenever a sailor who had overimbibed ran for the rail to evacuate , we would all heartilly call out `` stella '' ( ala brando ) . so , it was n't all bad ! !"

S"this was a bazaar experience ! i decided to reward myself with this beer and was intrigued at the store when it they had a 1995 reserve in 2006 . the cork broke when i tried to remove it and i noticed it was soaked all the way through . i 'm guessing the cork was not made to last 10 years and the beer probably was n't either . another note ... this bottle is only 8.45 ounces and it is still quite a shortfill ! dodging the specks of cork in the drink , i took a smell and it was almost like that of a tomato mixed with vinegar . the appearance is a reddish brown with absolutely no head or carbonation and the surface suggests that the beer is considering separation but has n't . i have to say it tastes a little like blood on the front palatte and the back palatte is more of an alcohol taste this was a great experience as it is one of the highest alcohol content beers i have had and because it is the oldest beer i have had . it is not easy to drink and now that i have rated it i 'm going to get some pizza to finish the rest with . even though this is a shortfill ... it is still really hard to finish . on a more positive note , i should mention that the bottle is quite a work of art . the cork is burried in plastic . the bottle appears black when filled and has gold lettering on it . when empty the bottle shows it 's true color , which is blue ."

S'slightly opaque straw/yellow color . head dissipates as it warms . malty aroma with honeyed mild fruit character . smells like a belgian ! low hop aroma and flavor . taste is balanced , yet leaning ever so slightly to the sweet side then saved by the one-two punch of yeast and alcoholic warmth . mild spiciness that increases with the temperature . some citrus and drunken stone fruit flavor . lingering aftertaste of vegetal flavor from what i may wrongfully identify as phenol ( almost starchy ) . could be a malt flavor . nearly perfect carbonation . medium to full mouthfeel makes the beverage dangerously easy to drink . this beer re-opened my eyes to the high quality very affordable belgian style beers made by this wonderful brewery .'

S"really liked the radioactive orange glow of this . the aroma is a hop whallop of all kinds of the stuff , and of course the citrus , pine and even mint in this one . taste , pretty bitter , and i was drinking this after some pretty bitter ipa 's last weekend . did n't find it abrasive or an alcohol punch at all , in fact , i ca n't think of anything to style that hides it as well as some elite brews ( pte , hopslam ) . while it has a ton of hop varieties , you ca n't really navigate them for their own properties , as there 's just too much here . not complex , just massive , in a good way . pricey , but worth checking it out at least once if you fashion yourself a hop head ."

S"bready , grainy , a bit of rice and a bit of corn ; i 'm not quite sure where the `` dry '' comes from either ( quoting previous reviews ) , although i definitely do n't think it 's better than busch or busch light . tastes like bud light but it has more drinkability , and it 's a bit cheaper at most spots i 've found . also better than bud ice , but not as cheap as it . somewhere in the middle of those two types is where bud dry lies . mouthfeel is very airy and unpresent , although it has a little bit of crispness to it which gives it a couple positive points . overall , it 's another budweiser that tastes how you would expect . get pabst or busch instead if you 're on a budget ."

S"appearance : pale golden body , quite hazy . thick white-yellow head is rocky and fading fast . aroma : the banana-yeasty smell hit me as soon as i cracked the bottle . upon closer inspection , there 's a distinct tinge of orange as well , maybe some apple , and a non-specific spiciness that i 'm digging . taste & mouthfeel : everything from the aroma is here too , but i 'm startled by the prominent malted barley taste upfront ; kind of a round breadiness that really starts to get in the way of the spices . a mild hop flavor rounds out the sip . the body is very very thick , but the alcoholic warmth does n't kick until the very end of the 5th or 6th sip . drinkability : even for a tripel this is a bit thick and , by about halfway through the glass , prominently alcoholic . it is a nice sipping beer though , as the spices only come out more as it warms up . overall this is a pretty decent belgian-style tripel ; i was glad that victory did n't try to americanize this style by overwhelming it with cascades or something ."

S"750ml bottle into duvel tulips . a- very clear and crisp brown on the pour , in the glass it is a darker , reddish color . the head is thick , and the color they call mocha that looks nothing like the coffee of the same name . s- very sweet with lots of forest-berry aromas , with a choco-vanilla hint , assumedly from the malt . t- spice and fruit linger behind and alongside the thick malt profile , with the fruit of the nose far removed from where it was expected to be . the dominant flavor is of spices , like a spicy cinnamon loaf , combined with the 9 % abv , the result is very warming . the berries of the nose are sadly underrepresented , and the label 's `` honey and citrus peel '' seem to be more added to sound enticing on the label than to be significant ingredients . the end result is n't *bad , * in fact it is rather nice , but it is not what the aroma , or the bottle itself , might lead you to expect . for a bsda i find it to be far too much malt and not nearly enough ... flavor besides malt . m- much thinner than i expected . not creamy or thick at all . in the glass , it looks quite heavy , and the head is fairly substantial , but in the mouth , the beer is light , and with the heavy amounts of malt and spice present , it winds up feeling lacking in body , though it is n't wattery by any stretch . honestly , if the mouthfeel had matched the flavor profile in any way , this beer would have received a much better score from me . d- i do n't think any 9 % is going to be overly drinkable , but i do n't especially like this beer , so i would rate it poorly . notes- if you want a strong , spiced-unto-spicy beer that wo n't weigh down your stomach with tons of body , and is n't distracted by fruit flavors , you might like this beer . i do n't care for `` winter warmer '' types , and if i had known that was what this is , i probably would have passed on it . rated as a bsd it fares even worse ."

S"first taste of allagash . a- kind of had to ''build '' the head by raising the bottle towards the end . the beige foam still is n't very impressive but by no means would i call it ugly , just a bit disappointing . liquid is very nice though : a ruby mahogany if there is such a thing . kind of hazy . swirled the bottle for the last pour and got a nicer looking serving . head now looks chewier and liquid is like 90 % ( he.. ) opaque . more brown than mahogany ruby . lacing is ordinary . edit just checked the allagash website : ''allagash dubbel boasts a dark mahogany color with ruby hues '' i love it when my reviews are n't nonsense ! s- dark fresh fruit instead of the often dried fruit i find in dubbels . a little bit of chocolate . warming up releases a lot more chocolate . t- a lot more chocolaty than the smell led on . alcohol fits in nicely . i can taste the water a lot more than other dubbels i 've tried . interesting because it 's light yet tasty . label does n't state anything about hops but i get some grassy , woody , nuttiness that seems to be hop induced . maybe this is wrong for the style but i am really enjoying the hoppiness . m- high carbonation . smooth and dry . does n't foam up as much as other dubbels . i 'd say this is more of good pale ale mouthfeel . d- very high . i 'd down a few of these easy . some dubbels are so delicious , they 're easy to drink , this one is just so light and crisp it 's easy to drink . really feels like a mix of a pale ale and a dubbel with so much hoppiness and not that much yeast character . glad i tried it with an open mind ( not really craving belgian and kind of hop hungry ) . would buy it again ."

S"poured into a tulip glass from a bottle labeled 09/07/2008 . very intense head , like sea foam that just wo n't go away- i do n't mind this , really , but it makes it a little challenging to pour the whole bottle . its a shadowy orange color , much lighter than i was expecting but once it opens up and the `` sea foam '' subsides , the smell is delicately spicy , like nuts roasted in butter and coriander . orval has a nice maltiness to it that gives it a refreshing , almost biscuity crispness . hints of lemon , sweet yeast , and white grapes are hiding behind the malt . very refreshing in a white trash way , i wish they made this beer in `` affordable '' ( i 'm talkin $ 20- $ 25 ) 12 packs - even in cans- so us prestigious bastards could easily pick one up and take it to a party , bonfire , or camping because its so easy to drink . mine was gone before i knew it- and yes , there is still sea foam down one side of my glass . a great trappist , though not quite what i was expecting . get you one !"

S"12 oz bottle poured into a weiss glass . 4.5 % abv , bottled on 04/28/10 . a - a fizzy , loose white head explodes upwards with a loud , soda-like aroma before deflating to not a single bubble , ring , or any trace of it 's existence despite the constant stream of carbonation up through the beer . the beer below is a lightly hazy pale straw yellow . my only complaint about this unattractive beer is the head , but for the inherent acidity , it fits perfectly into the style . s - light lactic acid notes with a hint of sourness pairs up with a sweet peach aroma akin to syrup but not overly sweet . pale malts and a touch of soft wheat with a pin-prick of huskiness finishes it out . the aroma is very low overall . t - light sourness is fleeting while the acidity sticks around on the tongue . wheat is favored in the flavor while a pinch of huskiness melds with pale malts . the peach is almost lost in translation here , adding only a thimble-like splash of fruitiness . m - light-bodied and fully carbonated , festina is crisp and bright with a good lingering acidic finish on the tongue . decent here but it seems a bit lack-luster with an absence of anything really defining . d - day-um , this goes down well . it 's just a bit carbonated for my liking as it would refresh on a hot summer day but is also bloat the drinker . festina is a balanced but lacking brew that seems a bit uncharacteristic of dogfish head ."

S'poured a deep ruby-caramel color with a large fizzy head . nice sticky lacing throughout . aroma was subtle at first but later became quite intense . rich , nutty , oaky and toffee-like . sweet and creamy . taste was a mix of super rich caramel and toasted malts . smokey and woody . brown sugar was evident as well . alcohol was somewhat pronounced but welcomed . slight hoppy bitterness in finish . oily , silky smooth and chewy consistency . medium-light bodied for a dopplebock . a great savoring beer . makes for a nice dessert/after dinner drink .'

S"not sure on age on this beer as no freshness date is visible but i am certain it has at least a little age on it appearance- off the pour its an extremely dark brown with no light at all to be seen through it starts off almost looking flat but with few seconds its slowly slowly bubbles and creates very short lived thin white head that fades to white lacing , smell- malts , rum , raisins , malty nose but rather faint overall , taste- flavor is all very faint not sure if this could be product of too much age , slight faint malts and very almost gone bitterness on the back end , all the flavors are very faint and muted , slight alcohol flavor of almost a port or brandy , as it warmed the slight bitter hop tones on the finish became slightly more pronounced , also faint chocolate tones to be noticed , overall the flavor is not bad on this and not shot yet but probably getting there as finish of drying is now very faint , overall very mellowed flavor mouthfeel- very heavy thick and smooth with very little carbonation drinkability- at this point though the beers not horrible its not particular ally great , i have to be totally fair and say i have never had a fresher example of this beer and i guess never will , so cant totally rank this beer at all would n't be fair , at any rate this beer has shown it could handle age with out being spoiled , hmm wonder what this once was : )"

S'pours orangey amber with a nice white head that leaves moderate lacing . the smell is definitely hoppy , but a bit more subdued than most american ipas . lemony , grassy and herbal hops dominate the aroma . the flavor is quite strange . very bitter , but the hop flavor is a flash in the pan that soon gives way to harsh , dry bitterness . what little hop flavor there is tastes like lemon grass . not a bad flavor , but i prefer it less than either the usual american or british hop profiles . alcohol is strangely evident even though this beer is under 7 % abv . really not getting much malt at all , this beer seems buried in bittering hops . very dry finish and a body that is on the light side of medium . it would be fairly drinkable if not for the fact that it really does not taste that great . pretty disappointing coming from such a renowned brewery .'

S"poured from the very light brown bottle into my `` second city chicago '' weizen glass . a very clear body with a honey hue and a head which was at first nice and generous but it dissipated quickly . i was trying to get a big head too . s kind of a weak lager but there is also a nice honey , spice smell . certainly i give it credit for some interesting complexity in a lager . t very light tasting lager with that bit of honey that mostly comes in the aftertaste ( where i would expect it to since after the lager washes away the honey is left stuck to surfaces in my mouth ) . nice , pleasant taste and exactly what one would expect . m very light . only a honey aftertaste brings this back from feeling a lot like water . i think that this is below average for the style as it is listed here on ba but i am not sure that it is an american amber . d excellent , and this is the point . i believe this beer to be made to be drinkable and it delivers ."

S"appearance : grngesbergs pilsner pours a typically golden-to-light-yellow and transparent colour along with a thick crown with big bubbles , which instantaneously diminishes and leaves some-to-no-lacing . smell : quite neutral actually , however one might hint a little malt and sweetness in the back . taste : almost a bit sour at first then there 's the aftertaste , which resembles that of unsalted popcorn . grngesbergs pilsner suffers the same fate with the taste as with the smell - all too mediocre , nothing really sticks out . sure there is some malt to it , but it 's really unnoticeable . mouthfeel : watery yet somewhat smooth , the carbonation is sensible . drinkability : on its own it becomes all too anonymous , but would serve as a decent compliment to a bbq-stake - a typical fire extinguisher , no more , no less . still way better than your average run-of-the-mill ( er ) , although that does n't tell us much ... summary : grngesbergs pilsner 's main problem is n't that it tastes bad - it 's that it tastes bland !"

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a mug a- what a lousy looking beer ! seriously , my urine is darker than this . it was a very yellow . the only aspects that saved it from a 1 rating was the frothy medium size white head and its clearness . s- wheat , hops , a hint of blackberry ( which is odd , considering this is a fruit beer ) . i should have known then t- oh boy . the blackberry was not very strong , which is bad . the tastes of blackberry and wheat do not go well together , which makes it very bad . the blackberry was kind of bitter , when combined with the hoppy bitterness of the beer itself , makes this beer undrinkable . m- thin . very very thin . it was well carbonated , but not smooth at all . d- grr this makes me mad ! i like long trail 's brown ale and hibernator seasonal , and the fact that i have to say i wont drink this again pisses me off !"

S"this review is from written notes that i made while on vacation in dublin , ireland apr '09 ... i only came across them now : ) a- this is a clear brew with a golden/grassy color and there was n't much head upon pouring , fizzling out quickly to a thin ring . big carbonation bubbles that move slowly suggesting a fuller body possibly . great labeling ... .the bottle looks exactly like what homer simpson drinks ! s- big noble hop aromas ! clean smelling overall with sweet malts , and some lingering flowery aroma in the backround . t- the malts were very prominent on the font of the palate , with the hop bitterness kicking in on the back and throughout the finish . this left a nice bitter aftertaste following the swallow . a nice strong pils ! m- there was heavy carbonation witch left a tang on the palate . the body was on the lighter side but not to the point of being watery . d- if this beer is good enough for homer , then it is good enough for me ! it 's clean , crisp beer that has decent flavor and would be a great brew to enjoy with friends . i will have this again if given the chance , or if the trademarking ever allows for legal brewing over here in north america !"

S"i must concede before i start that i rather like corona for sentimental reasons and buy it a few times a year . that said , from a critical standpoint it is n't very good . a- straw ( piss ? ) yellow , bubbly . comes in it 's fairly recognizable clear , long-neck bottle . since the bottles are clear this stuff is usually skunked if you buy it in a 6 pack . get a 12'er that comes in an opaque box and it 's usually better . t- eh . has a light taste with little distinctness . has a little bit of spice on the front . consequently , it pairs fairly well with a wide range of foods , particularly spicy ones . lime improves , but that 's cheating . m- fizzy , pretty refreshing . rather nice on a hot day , this one is a thirst quencher . d- goes down easy because of it 's lightness . illogically fun to drink . overall , as a beer lover i ca n't say corona is very good . but , i think fondly of this beer . if i 'm in the mood it certainly scratches that itch for something light and crisp . that said , bohemia is infinitely better if you want something from mexico . if you do buy this beer , as i said make sure to get it in a 12 pack . i 've never bought a sixer that was n't skunked ."

S"my experience with gruits has been fairly limited , but i have enjoyed the ones i 've come across , and the idea of using alternatives to hops is one that intrigues me . great lakes have only recently got into cask brewing , and making more experimental beers in general . producing a cask of a hop-free beer is certainly adventurous , and i applaud them for their ambition , but i feel that this one is perhaps a little to ambitious for their current capabilities . disregarding the flavour for now , this beer performs well in all other sensory categories . the pour is dark brown , verging on black , with a wispy white head that lasts the duration . the aroma has some strong pine notes ( i understand spruce was used in the brew ) , and a strong underlying fruitiness that reminded me of heather ales ebulum gruit , which is made with elderberries . the body is also where it should be - medium-light with a restrained cask carbonation . while none of this particularly wows me , its difficult to find any specific faults to criticise . sadly , the same can not be said of the flavour , and this is one of the most unpleasant beers i 've come across . a straightforward sip reveals a berry-esque fruitiness , a hint of smoke and a piny bitterness . really not too shabby , but again , nothing exceptional . the problems begin when the liquid hits the back and sides of the tongue , where an overwhelming inky bitterness kills everything else dead . its certainly bitter , but not in the pleasing way of an ipa . this is an acrid , inky bitterness that lingers on the palate for an unpleasantly long time . i can only really compare it to the time i idiotically sucked some ink out of my fountain pen . this is all really too bad , and from speaking to a few others i 'm not alone in my opinion ( though i was alone in actually finishing my glass ) . the brewery is learning new styles , and a new technique of storage and serving , so growing pains like this can be expected . give em time and i think they 'll nail it , hopefully when they do they 'll revisit this style and erase my memory of this gruit ."

S"sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle notched with a freshness dating of saturday . beer pours hard brown orange with a big fluffly white head and a slow trickle of carbonation . big grassy hoppy and with apple and just a small dose of diacetyl in the final note as a toasted malt bite provides the final base . flavor is at first brisk and hoppy with enough malt to provide counterbalance to the bitterness . the back end is driven by a hard drying mineral prescense that holds fast to the palate and wont let go . personally i 'd prefer a bit less of that mineral bite to make the final touch of the beer a good thing.."

'' and moves along its way . not great , not horrible . crisp and carbonated , a light mouthfeel , quite drinkable . i would n't mind running into it again but i certainly would n't seek it out . good for a `` chilling time '' beer or a party standard . of course , i 'd rather have a samuel smith taddy porter or a nut brown instead as a `` chilling '' beer ..."

S"bought a 12 oz single for 89 cents at the local liquor mart . cheaper than bottled water fercrissakes . said `` bit 07 '' on the back , so i 'm thinking less than a year old . appearance was perfectly golden , a nice frothy head with some lacing . a steady column of bubbles from the bottom of my mug . just what a pilsener should look like . the smell was of grass and earthiness .. right away i picked up those classic saaz hop aromas . a little bit of citrus comes out with a few swirls . the taste was that grass/earthiness of the saaz , with a sweetness coming at the end from the malt . nothing too fancy here . towards the end , the bitterness from the hops came out . very well-balanced . i had this really cold and it 's already hot here in texas , so it went down in less than five minutes . drinkability is off the charts and i 'm getting a case tomorrow . a great everyday drinking beer ..."

S"draft at the brewpub . a - clear light golden color with a lasting white head . s - wheat , banana , clove , and citrus . smells pretty nice , if a bit weak . t - wheat and pale malt , yeast , banana , and lemon . a little watery but overall the flavor is pleasant . m - very light and crisp on the palate , if a little weak . d - well , because it 's a bit watery and is a fairly light style to begin with , this goes down like flavored water . so i have to give it points here ."

S"appearance : this brew looks pretty standard for the style . the name might lead you to believe that this beer is at least colred red , but it 's not ; it 's a cystal clear golden color . head formation ( ~1/2 finger ) , retention , and lacing are all quite poor . smell : again , there is n't much to say here given the style . like many cheap macros , the aroma is an uninticing mix of grain , metal , and hops . the former two scents are the dominant ones , but there is a little detectable hoppiness . it smells like your standard crappy college beer . taste : the taste matches the nose well ; unfortunately , this is n't saying much . strong graininess and mellow hop flavor lead to a very metallic aftertaste . this beer has plenty of bite , but not the good kind - it makes me cringe . the flavor also gets worse as the temperature of the beer rises . mouthfeel : it 's not as light as i was expecting . i 'd rate the body as medium to medium-light . the beer is fairly smooth given the metallic flavor , but this is n't really saying much . drinkability : i have a feeling that this is what the beer was crafted for ( if you can say `` crafted '' ) . if there was a redeeming characteristic , i would say that this is probably it . it 's easy to drink many of these quickly because you 're not skimping out on any flavor . summary : i 'm not impressed , but i guess that 's easy to say when you 're not expecting much . from what i read , this beer 's price point is just above that of milwaukee 's best . it 's not too terrible if served very cold and eaten with some food , but i would n't go out of my way to try this again . if you 're just looking to get drunk , then i suppose this would n't be a bad option . i 'd say it 's a step up from the standard college fare ( keystone , natural ice , etc . ) , but nothing special ."

S"the cooper 's vintage ale poured a dark cloudy brown color . it smelled of strong hops and spice . the carbonation was high for most beers , but felt fairly moderate for cooper 's . the body of the beer was fairly heavy , it is a very strong ale . the hops were prominent , just as in the smell . and it had a strong finish with the ample taste of spice . this was an interesting beer . it was delicious while drinking it , but i really do n't see someone drinking a lot of it . the spice was really strong , and my girlfriend said said it tasted of soy sauce , which i can kinda see ( it was not a bad thing , just a really spicy finish ) ."

S"this was poured out of a 22oz bottle . out of the bottle i was very impressed . there was an off white cream head that stuck around for a while . the color was a dark amber to copper tone . the aroma was great ! it had a complex malt-hop mix that was different than most dipa 's that are all hops aroma . the taste was heavy and unimpressive . i most of the flavors melded together into an indistinguishable burn . i think there were some hints of pine , but they were all quickly erased by the harsh alcohol burn . too much . mouth feel was thick and heavy . this drank like a stout and overstayed it 's welcome on my tongue . imho great divide pushes towards some great big beers , but needs to learn when to say when . i had a saranac high peaks side by side with this , both dipa 's and there was no comparing the two . one was thick heavy and a struggle to get down , the other smooth and full of character . i recommend the saranac hp for anyone looking for a good dipa . *i need to disclose that i live in syracuse ( not far from utica where saranac is brewed ) so i am always a little bias towards the home town brew ."

S'this beer came out a hazy orange-gold with about a half-inch white head on top . beautiful sip rings and lacing globs all over the glass . well done . smells of floral hops and wonderful sweet citrus . very inviting . mouthfeel is a tad wet on this . this was just a little too slick on the tongue ; disappointing . flavor was of grapefruity bitterness that bit way back in my jaw muscles . finished slighty sweet with a bit a twang on the end . it was a little tamer than i expected though . it was good , but not great . drinkability is high with this one . i could see getting more than one pint of this in a sitting . decent .'

S"huge thanks to dave at the publik house brookline for pulling this out of the basement and hooking me up with a huge surprise . especially since it has been aged for 2 years . once my heart restarted i poured this bad boy into a westvleteren glass ( also provided by dave ) and noticed that all the carbonation was gone . this was a bit of a disappointment because i remember in a fresher version i had the carbonation caused the yeast to swirl and swim around when the glass is sitting still . it was visually stunning and added to this beers mystique . the aged beer still had a fresh and balanced smell , a bit more molasses / maple syrup then i remember . the taste follows a trend i have noticed with aged belgian darks , the flavors seem to meld and result in an overall flavor timeline similar to raisin bran . the front is sweet like a dried raisin , the middle is where the molasses and maple syrup are present , then when the hops appear they transform the flavor to a hearty , malty , grainy flavor ( the bran part ) . meanwhile the alcohol is hidden well , it 's there if you look for it , and overall the beer is very well balanced . i have noticed that with age the flavors have toned down and blended much better ( as expected ) . especially the alcohol , in my previous review i mentioned that the alcohol flavor was too strong that it overpowered the rest of the beer . i rated the 8 over the 12 because of the alcohol flavor balance . so it was a pleasant surprise to see that age has solved this issue . mouthfeel has also changed due to the lack of carbonation . i recall the fresh version evaporated on the tongue , it was epervescent , and lively . the aged version is more syrup like and smooth , which allows you to roll the beer around the tongue and really study the flavors before it evaporates . that being said , i like the fresh version better . it 's more of a party in your mouth . and the drinkability i have to give a high mark because it was very smooth and balanced . the real test was that i was with a newbie to `` good beer '' and she probably drank more of it than i did ."

S"pours a deep golden straw color with a 1 1/2 head of fizzy white foam that settles and then disappears all together . well it does say `` ginger ale '' on the description , so soda quality is forgiven . rye , wheat , other domestic grass aroma with wafts of ginger and a honey malt backbone . quite light but i do n't think i 've smelt any beer so medicinal . taste is very heavy on that grassy quality like a herb tea filtered with straw . more ginger appears on the back end when it warms , short and sweet like a ginger snap or a honey glazed piece of the root . this part i like , ginger is quite soothing and warming . finishes very dry . mixed feelings as a whole , maybe this will be a go to beer when i have a sore throat or something . despite the head fizzing out like a candle in the wind it stays well carbonated and has a good body . drinkable brew , slight grassy bitterness , no alcohol present , ginger quality never gets old . i start to feel better about it the longer i stay on this one ."

S'sampled at blue palms in los angeles , consumed 9/12/08 , reviewed from notes , thanks to chris for bringing this keg up to la a-golden yellow color with light orange highlights , slightly murky , 1/2 inch thin soapy white head , some retention left a pillow of fluffiness , minimal lacing s-bananas , strong yeast , cloves , coriander , herbs , other spices , lemons , orange peel , faint hops , grass , and flowers t-starts off with a big yeasty flavor , has some chewiness in the middle , mild fruit and hoppiness in the finish , was expecting a little funk based on the smell but could not taste any at all , gets sweeter as it warms and sugary spices comes to the surfaces , the cloves are most dominant but they are sweeter than usual , still yeast in the flavor until the end , not bad overall m-dry , sweet , and spicy mouthfeel , thin to medium body , lots of carbonation , taste does not last long d-could drink a few glasses of this for sure , light on the stomach , low in alcohol and it is hidden , would make a nice session beer , would be nice on a hot day second beer ever tasted from this brewery , actually right after their chocolatte porter , have been drinking a lot of saisons lately and this one did not quite hold up to those but they were great , still might drink again , worth trying'

S"this is hi-tech beer ! ( like the computer you are using to view this review ) i 'd challenge anyone to home-brew or even take the time to brew this beer . this beer ( ? ) /beverage is like malt flavored bottled water with a bit of a buzz . judged on this premise , it can be awe-some ! i wish i could drink this from my water bottle at work ! .. or on the bus , or in public ! : - ) disclaimer : i 've been doing ana ( atkins , low carb ) so i appreciate a low carb beer . i can easily have fun drinking 4-6 of these to come up with a decent review and not get too buzzed ! 2.6 % abv ? damn ! .. maybe ab has re-invented the english mild : -p ( low carb ) . on sale and in a can , i like this stuff . i buy it for about $ 14 per 18 pack , and compared to other low carb food , that 's a damn good deal . compared to bottled water it 's pretty good too , plus a malt back and buzz . i 'm not crazy ; i 'm not gon na pay top $ for this stuff . it has a watery initial flavor , some mid flavor and an every so slightly malty after taste . i serve this from a can , into a glass . i like to see this beer . i drink with pleasure and do n't slam these . do you 'slam ' your premium bottled water ? this brand is probably like `` pepsi one vs. coke zero '' -- miller 64 vs. ab select 55 , but i hope they keep the category . for buzz , 3 of these is pretty close to 1 12 oz . 8 % beers . with a way less carbs ! maybe a designated driver could have one of these when out with a group .. just one .. with some food ... maybe get a bit of a buzz which would soon be gone . if bud or any american mega beer is beer , then so is this . ( or a malty , watery beverage , brewed , and with a bit of a buzz ) an ultimate lawnmover beer .. to have a couple or few before and after mowing the lawn !"

S"wow ! this was really exciting to try , had it on a beer-testing session , really cool to finally get to try this ber-hyped beer . what can you expect then ? the color is pitch black with a small beige/brown foam . it really looks quite evil . aroma holds lots of dark chocolate , hardly rosted malts but also some nice vanilla notes . all i can say is that you can tell there is a ton of everything in this beer , they have n't been saving in on anything . taste is even better ! full on dark chocolate , hardly rosted malts , lots of sweetness aswell . there are also notes of complex and fruity `` vinous '' notes . some nice hints of vanilla rounds it of . amazing !"

S"i love victory 's beers and i love hops , so when i saw their `` hop wallop '' sitting at my favorite beer shop ( brawley 's in charlotte ) it was pretty much an assured purchase . hop wallop is beautiful bubbly golden nectar with a fluffy cream head . the head lingers a long while , and leaves some mad lacing down the sides of my glass . awesome . put your nose to the glass and you 're assaulted with hops . hops hops hoppity hop hops . fresh , piney , sweet , grapefruit smelling hops ! did you expect anything else ? the victory website says wallop is made with `` american whole flower '' hops which is n't very enlightening . pity , i 'm curious to know what 's in here . taste is what you 'd expect - hops and lots of 'em ! in fact there 's very little else discernible in this beer apart from hops . perhaps some yeast and honey flavor ... but mostly the piney , bitter , oily hop goodness . the 8.5 % is quite hidden behind the cascade of hop flavor . this is a rather bitter beer , so be warned . put simply , `` wallop '' is a most appropriate name hop wallop warms the tongue and stomach and leaves behind a fine dry hop bitterness as it slides down your gullet . just really tasty stuff -- if you like hops . i personally enjoyed this beer , but it 's almost too much . not the type of thing i 'd drink on a regular basis , and certainly not a session beer for me . if you , like i , have times when you get a craving for hops , this certainly satisfies . if you like hops en masse , you 'll love hop wallop ."

S"appearance : dark brown , a decent layer of tan foam , head is a bit rocky w/ pretty good retention , slight haze aroma : a balanced hit of malt and clovey phenols , raisins , rum , a wisp of hops , acetone flavor : starts off with a subdued maltiness , then a strong alcohol flavor takes over which is then mitigated by a smooth sweetness , touch of chocolate , yeast , raisins , the finish is semi-sweet w/ a hop bitterness riding out in the aftertaste mouthfeel : medium-full body , gentle carbonation , creamy texture , nice alcohol warmth without the burn overall impression : finally , after all the hype , i tried this beer ( yeah , shame on me for taking so long ! ) . it does not disappoint . a world class beer , all the way . definitely deserving to be in the top 50 , just maybe not at # 1 . come on guys , is the abv really that important ! ? ! i tried to review this without the beer 's `` rep '' clouding my judgement . and also before the beer 's cojones rendered my judgement unreliable !"

S"an incredible bottle of beer , this one being vintage 2000 . i only bought one at cork n bottle , but i 'll go back for more to let them condition for each of several years . this is truly a fallback brew that tells us what the original imperial stouts were all about . the beautiful little 11.2 ounce bottle is truly corked and wrapped in thick platinum foil . the look to this beer is incredible and yet disappointing as it has no head nor lace , just a few bubbles of beige foam on a rough pour . the body is as black and thick as crude oil . no light penetrates this liquid . dark burgundy shows at the extreme edges when held to strong light . the nose is huge on this beer . it gives off ripe fruit scents , of cherries and berries , while hinting of roasted grains and woodiness . the taste is simply overwhelming in its strength and complexity . the feel is oily and syrupy with no hint of carbonation or crispness . this is a definitive slow sippin ' beer if there ever was one . the aftertaste is exceedingly strong and lingering , almost to a fault . there are wood notes , roasted grain notes and a very strong port wine sense . complex . filling . strong . lasting . this is in no way a high drinkability beer . alcohol is obvious and notable ."

S"very fruity fermentation aroma . i 'm getting a big malt backbone with apples , peaches , plums and all kinds of fruit . there 's some hop aroma , but it takes a bacseat to the malt . i smell some interesting malt that seems a little like vienna but it 's not easy to pick out . some sniffs is like vienna and others seem like dark crystal . light amber , on the light end of what i 'm used to seeing in a barleywine . smallish but lasting head with food lacing . very clear . small rising carbonation . flavor is kind of strange . i get a lot of malt flavors , but there 's some overripe fruit thing going on . kind of like dms but not really . kind of like diacetyl , but not really . this is weird because there 's something there that my palate does n't like but i ca n't quite put my finger on what it is . hop bitterness is pretty high and there 's good hop flavor in the mid palate . but whatever that flavor is keeps me from really enjoying it . full bodied and smooth . creamy on the toungue . that off flavor keeps me from really enjoying drinking this so it gets low marks for drinkability . it 's a tough glass for me to get through ."

S"pours black with a mocha head that dissipates to leave a few wispy remnants on the surface . the aroma is very fruity , slightly bitter and dark . the flavour leads with a hit of fruit , before melting into caramel , dark chocolate and a slight coffee bitterness . the mix going on in this beer reminded me a little of anchor porter . the palate was n't as i expected - the image of engine oil suggested a very thick , almost syrupy , liquid . instead the body was medium-light , but with a creamy undertone that suits the beer well . carbonation was practically non-existent , which i think is a good decision based on the flavours going on here . the lighter body and low carbonation made this a very easy drinker , and the glass was empty all too soon . i could easily have had another ."

S"a very nice session brew , but with a little bit of a kick . it pours a light gold with a thin , but dense and foamy white head . the aroma is all spicy and herbal hops ... smells very much like saaz but i hear that the poles use their own similar variety called lublin . the taste is also slightly dominated by herbal , spicy hops but there 's some grain and simple-sugar-sweet malt providing balance but never overwhelming the hops . the taste would make me label this brew a mild pilsner . very crisp , clean , refreshing finish ... highly drinkable ."

S"it pours a sold black color with around two inches of a light brownish color head . the smell is almost nothing but chocolate . not the bland hersey 's kind though . the smell is a mix of milky chocolate and dark bitter chocolate . the taste starts with a milky chocolate flavor that moves on to a bitter yet chocolaty kind of finish . the finish in particular is amazing : it highlights a blend of bitter hops , slightly bitter , slightly sweet chocolate and slightly sweet , slightly smokey and slightly bitter malts . overall an excellent chocolate stout that has strong chocolate flavors without being too sweet ."

S"bought a six of this recently at a well-stocked package store . had heard of this famous old beer , and was eager to sample it . poured into a pilsner glass . is this bottle conditioned , or un-filtered ? not expecting cloudiness/sediment in this style . skunky aroma . very skunky taste . way more than i expected from a green bottle beer . no code date of any kind . the other 5 bottles went to `` lawnmower beer '' status . now i learn from other reviews of this beer that not only is it no longer produced , but was last reviewed in early 2006 ! will be returning the rest of this 5 year old beer to the place of purchace !"

S"on my journey of buying the cheap of the cheap beers , i soon stumbled upon a case of this . i do n't attempt to pour such a beer since it is meant to be consumed out of the can . the beer is fairly carbonated , but not overly so like a keystone light . the beer is very sweet with some malt here and there . the aftertaste is similar to a white wine . very fruity and sweet beer for this kind of brew . i put this towards the top of the cheap macro brews . do n't overlook it the next time you look to pick up a case of stones or bush , you may be suprised . and you wo n't have to worry about anybody else drinking your beer !"

S"on tap at the belmont brewing co i was happy to see that nestled in amongst the bbc 's own beers they had a few from green flash , including this one that i 've not had previously . it pours a golden color , looking a lot like a tripel . smell-wise too , i would have guessed this a tripel : there was clove , belgian yeast and slight citrus . the hops didnt really come out until the bitterness of the taste . it took me awhile to warm up to it as it didnt have the bouquet of say an urthel hop-it or a poperings hommel . i will say that as it warmed it warmed up to me . i will say the high abv came out in the taste a bit which had me switch beers after just one ."

S"the beer pours a brilliantly clear yellow color . if you were to hold this up next to budweiser you may have a hard time visually telling the difference , for a bohemian pilsner this beer 's color is at the mark , albeit the low end of the color scale . in the aroma you have a lot more malt aroma than you would in that bud , and that 's a good thing , the bad thing is the hop aroma levels of the saaz is a bit lower than i would expect for this style . the malt aroma is crisp and grainy , while the hop aroma is a bit more floral for me than spicy , as well as being low . as for the flavor , the hop bitterness is a bit underdone as well as the flavor . the malt flavor is lingering as well . the bitterness is quite a bit lower than what i have had in many other bohemian pils , but it is there and it does not linger into the finish . i do like the beer 's finish and it does leave you wanting more , the malt is just slightly sweet and finishes clean . stylistically the beer misses the mark a bit for a claim as a bohemian pils , but it does deliver as a good easy drinking summer beer . i guess it all depends on what the main goal of this beer was , if it was to nail a bohemian pilsner style or be a mass market craft beer perfect for summer events . i would put my money on the latter . but this beer still could benefit from a boost in the saaz hops additions even if it was just a little ."

S"a - about three fingers of head over an orangish copper brew . this head dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing . s - a rather clean , bland aroma with a touch of steamed vegetables , possibly pumpkin , but that 's a tough sell . t - very mild flavor , a bit of rice and a touch of pumpkin , really though it is more like winter squash . pretty dissappointing flavor . m - thin , somewhat refreshing , neutral on the smoothness front . d - not bad , it is mildly flavored , but not very tasty . it is a quaffable brew , and , surprisingly , not a total insult to pumpkin ales . i think i 'll take other options in the future though ."

S"poured a 2007 vintage into a brandy snifter style glass . a : very nice deep red , amber body , minimal head . s : big notes of toffee , butterscotch , caramel , strawberry ester like flavors and fairly mellowed out piney hop notes . t & m : a surprisingly fairly tame toffee and caramel malt flavor start off this big brew , followed by citrus , strawberry like ester flavors that ride through as the hop bitterness kicks in . hops are fairly mellow , but still do an excellent job of balancing out the malt sweetness . bitterness rides through to the end and is accompanied by a hint of dry alcohol flavor that melds nicely with the bitterness to leave you wanting another sip . the mouthfeel is the only thing i might say needs just a bit of work , as some sips it seemed to be just a tad thin for a big barleywine . still , plenty of body , i just tend to prefer a bit more for the style . ( i am nitpicking this brew to death since i like it so much ! ) d & notes : this one deceptively strong beer ! by far , the most balanced barleywine i have ever had , as the huge malt body is perfectly balanced by a good dose of hops , but yet even with 77ibus ( as claimed by real ale brewing 's website ) , the hops are not overdone at all . i would love to get my hands on a 2008 vintage bottle to compare it to this 2007 . reminds me of charlie papazian 's saying regarding that a barleywine not aged enough is like a mountain without its peak ."

S"bottled at the bruery this last weekend , thanks to a certain photo shoot that went down on friday . meant to get some more during the initiation party the next day , but i was having too good of a time drinking two dirty hookers in the main room to make it over to the special pour room . oh , well , the several ounces on friday was more than enough of this beast . very thick black with a small head and leaves lots of syrupy coating on the cup . massively intense aroma of chocolate and a shit ton of bourbon without the alcohol sharpness . a touch of oak , but mainly sweet bourbon and chocolate . hugely thick and rich flavor . very sweet and chocolate-bourbon flavored on the front on the tongue , but with a toasty and bitter roasty finish that manages a surprising balance . in the initial sip you do n't really detect much alcohol , but it really comes out in the finish once it eats through the residual sugar on your tongue . insanely thick and mouth coating in an almost gross way to be honest . an exceptional beer to be sure , but i ca n't really decide if i would ever be interested in it beyond a two-ounce sample every now and again . total props to the bruery for making a beer this tasty and envelope-pushing , but it really fills a tiny niche in the beer world ."

S"presentation : 11oz bottle in a small snifter nose is almost white wine like , chardonnay grapes , even a little champagne sweetness , a lite floral quality , crisp , dry . fruits like fig , pear are present . its very effervescent , pouring crisp , loud , strong bubbling laces the glass innards with a pinky 's worth of dull , pale lemon-white loose foam that danced , then faded quickly to a lite film . a warm , slightly orangish-gold in hue , its murky and cloudy . this is an odd take on a tripel . the strong white wine grape , and sweet at that , is very strong up front . its dry , a little sugary but in no way syrupy , with a quirky sour dullness ( perhaps the oak barrels ? ) balancing the otherwise winelike sweetness . it does bitter some on the pallete , then finishes with a slight rush as the alcohol rises up and is noticed , warming the throat & mouth with a bittersweet quality that finishes relatively clean , leaving a sight chewiness in the mouth . i can say its different , and definitely a unique interpretation of the genre , but i 'm not buying what they are trying to sell my tastebuds . it seems confused , without a focus . this may actually be a good beer to introduce to friends who like sweet white wines . i could see it being better as a warmer weather beer . if offered , i 'd drink another but i wo n't be buying any of this anytime . if you are looking for a tripel , go somewhere else ."

S"shades from pale yellow to yellow /w hints of orange , good head retention , some lacing , sparse carbonation . some hay and grassy scents , some metallic smells . subtle hops under the light malt , malt more noticeable after it warmed up some . more citrus in the taste than noticed from the smell , lemony , not sour though . grassy and metallic smells translate to the taste but the malt shows up too late and in the back of the palate . revision : after a couple more kamenitzas over several days , i think i flat out missed its malt profile . what i found there was a minimally sweet lightly roasted maltiness that improved taste overall , moving from 2.5 to 3.0 . plentiful , smooth carbonation . medium greenish wetness weighs medium early on followed by a lingering light malt at the finish . overall , i 'd like the malt to come through earlier and give some balance to the taste , but with the abv and its other qualities , its easy to have a few at a time . taste not outstanding , still quite drinkable ."

S"2006 bottle poured into a tulip . murky brown body . sorta ruby at the outer regions . one finger head reside to a nice layer of patchy foam on top . nice oily leg , no real lacing though . smell is quite sherry like . tons of oaky vanilla , ripe dark fruits , a strong dose of bourbon . there is also a mild cheese ring like scent . taste of rich sweet malts evoking caramel and vanilla fudge . followed by a hint of sherry , oak , vanilla and bourbon . taste is quite mellow ( probably from it 's age ) . mouthfeel is light feeling . medium bodied with high carbonation . reminds me of a belgian quad in terms of mouthfeel . hot in the belly with an oaky , slightly resiny bitter , and dry finish . really smooth with no trace of heat ."

S"i found this stubby 12 oz . at total wines in jacksonville , fl . the six pack was $ 6.99 . i poured my anniversary ale vigorously into my wedding mug . initially , i noticed a plume of big , airy , off white head of over an inch over the amber body of the beer . beer was a deep golden amber with a very few co2 bubbles rising slowly to the mass of head . overall , i find this a pretty good looking beer , not dream inducing , since the head dissipated and disappeared after the first few sips . the lacing was sporadic and uneven with the half away from the side i was drinking from finely laced and the mouth side covered with small packs of sparsely arranged groups of lacing . the nose was a cascade driven monster of citrusy goodness . this reminded greatly of a hop-rodded version of the basic sierra nevada pale ale . the taste disapointed after the impressive appearance and smell : it was nicely hopped , but proved thin and lacking complexity . the cascade driven nature of the manifested by the smell proves thin , and surprisingly , although not unbalanced , the beer lacks a true , malt backbone like many of the truly great american ips ( cough , cough : sierra nevada 's own celebration ale ) . sierra nevada 's anniversary ale is a sessionable beer . many , including the bros , may disagree due the fact that anniversary ale is 5.9 % , and .9 % above the generally considered 5.0 % threshold of session beers , but i 've enjoyed heavier , less drinkable beers again and again over the course of one long sitting ( not all experiences of that nature - of course - were without their headaches and hangovers ) . this is a solid beer that is worth checking out due to the probable one time nature of this beer being brewed . also , this is one hell of a value for a drinkable ipa , at least here in florida ."

S"appearance is a big factor for boddingtons - the nitro push gives you a beautiful cascade of bubbles , settling into a small head on a sunset gold body . it 's transparent , but not in the way you 'd associate with a fizzy beer . boddingtons smell is its low point : there is n't any . i strain and strain , and there 's a little grainy scent , but that is all . smell is big for me when it comes to beer , so it 's hard to get excited by the nose on this one . taste is smoothness defined : a microscopic hop bite , with some maltiness lasting only till the beer a swallowed . a bitterness remains on the tongue briefly , but you basically need to take another sip . this basically covers mouthfeel as well , your mouth returns to how it felt before the beer : this is both a good and bad thing . drinkability is where bodds shines to me . i frequent a bar near me that has good jazz , and boddington is the one of very few decent beers they offer , and the only one on draft . i tend to session with it when i go . it 's smooth and refreshing , and low enough in alcohol you can sip them all night and be in driving condition . not too flavorful , but there are occasions where you just want a cool beer you can taste all night . that 's boddingtons ' niche ."

S'cloudy tan beer with a big off white head . lovely bitter sweet smell . fruity but a totally indistinguishable type of fruit . maybe the elusive juicy fruit ! taste is sweet with a tart after taste . sort of like a sweet tart in a bottle . it is a very interesting beer , but i really do not know what i would do with it . may the cola generation likes it ? okay , so it is a faro which is a know sweet style . the taste is very natural . so i consider it good within its category . i have had some really artifical tasting ( french ) flavoured beers in the past . the bottle clearly states that the beer has candied sugar in it . the germans would of course burn it at the stack for this crime ! what i find really strange is that the label has pictures of hops on it . you could buy the beer thinking it was some sort of hop head beer . this beer is really at one of the extremes i never expected even existed . it has caught me off guard . i can not say i would explore the style further . of course being sugar sweet and low in alcohol . this beer should fit right into the cola/beer and banana juice/weizen market niche currently popular here in europe . better than a soft drink or a red bull/vodka ; i guess . i confess the last mouthful of the 25cl beer was just too sweet for me ! ! !'

S"have to say i was n't all that thrilled with the dirty bastard , but this beer here is a whole nuther kettle of fish . the beer pours an impressive dark amber red color with good head retention and lacing . the nose is otherworldly . i get a huge complex , sweet malty aroma , with nuances of cherry , vanilla , almond and chocolate . this beer smells incredible and you can tell it 's not for the faint of heart . this is clearly a very big beer . on the palate this beer is incredible . it 's very sweet and very rich , but there is so much going on it does n't tire out your palate . there is again lots of cherry and vanilla on the palate , and the beer has almost a fruit cake flavor about it . however , there is enough bitterness from the hops in the finish to keep it from becoming tiring to drink . the abv . is noticeable , but not intrusive , though i agree the high abv. , coupled with the richness , certainly make it difficult to have more then one . this is an exceptional beer . as far as i 'm concerned , dump the dirty the bastard and only make this liquid nectar from now on ."

S'this beer pours a slightly cloudy , golden yellow color , with a thin off white head . the head fades quickly , leaving no lace . this beer has a subtle caramel like malty aroma . it has a slight floral hop aroma also . i think the aroma is lacking . it is boring . i have had many pale ales that were more aggressive and complex in the aroma area , and that is what i want in an apa . this beer tastes exactly like it smelled . as with the aroma , i want more taste in my beer . this beer is refreshing . it goes down smooth , leaving a very slight caramel aftertaste . carbonation is good for the style . this beer would probably make an excelent session beer . low alcohol , and non aggressive flavor . overall : i didnt expect much , so i wasnt let down . i just moved to a beer wasteland , but i can find this everywhere . i assume i will have this on hand a lot since there is not much else . give me a few years , and i assume i will grow to love it .'

S"nice lightly golden appearance with a fairly resilient head . there really is n't much of a smell at all , most of the nasal experience comes from inhaling the co2 into your nose . this beer has some flavors of highly dominating citrus , more or less like limes with a slightly hoppy aftertaste . i am a hop-head and like my beer bitter , though this is more of a sour and would n't rate this one very high on flavor . out of a bottle this beer feels slightly over carbonated , yet very thin and light feeling . overall , with the sour aftertaste and overcarbonated feel and smell , i would n't consider drinking more than two or three of these in one setting . however , for the summer heat , i would bring these out in favor of what other beers are self-proclaimed as royalty ."

S"figured i 'd finally get around to reviewing guinness . i 've had this beer in more places and in more ways than any other beer i suppose . nitro tap , nitro can , nitro bottle ... in multiple states and in the caribbean . the best part of the beer is the appearance . dark as night with a high frothy cream-colored head with about the best retention of any beer created . leaves nice lace on the glass . also looks amazing if you can manage a proper black and tan pour ! smell is n't much to write home about ... biscuitty malts and an indescribable creaminess in the nose . the taste i rate as average . this is certainly the baseline for the style . and while there certainly are irish dry stouts that are worse , at least as many ( likely more ) are much better . dark malty flavors intermixed with that unmistakable nitro-draught flavor . no carbonation thanks to the nitrogen . super smooth and creamy , gives the beer a medium bodied mouthfeel . easily the 2nd best quality of the beer . drinkability is tough . you can find this anywhere . anywhere in the world they 'll have this . any piss-poor macro american bar you visit will still offer guinness . it goes down quickly and smoothly , low in alcohol . but i only drink this these days as a last resort or if i get a craving for a black and tan . so despite the good factors , if i do n't want to drink it is it really that drinkable ?"

S"another addition to my autumn-long pumpkin ale taste test , and this one is absolutely great . glad i came across this before they start disappearing from the shelves to make room for other seasonal releases . pour is from the bottle to a pint glass . appearance : pours a perfectly coppery/ruby color ; head starts at 1 and 1/2 fingers and fades almost immediately to an uneven layer of thin froth on the surface ; body is clear and shows very light carbonation ; a thin oily residue is left on the sides of the glass . smell : spices are especially abundant and pouring out of the glass ( strong and warm cinammon and nutmeg , as well as a certain carmalized or brown sugar sweetness that reminds me a bit of graham crackers ) . taste : absolutely fantastic ! wonderful and warm spice flavors are all over the palate and leave me feeling like i just had a piece of pie . strong cinammon and nutmeg and a very slight flavor of pumpkin flesh are present and dominate every aspect of the flavor . i 'm not sure if i 'm drinking a beer or having desert . mouthfeel : warm and tingly on the palate ( could be from the 8 % abv or spiciness , but it 's definitely not from the carbonation ) ; carbonation is fairly mild and smooth ; mouth is left slightly sticky and warms the chest down to the belly . drinkability : wonderful flavors and smells ; a very filling beer and the abv is a tad high - while it 's great , i do n't think i 'd want more than one in a night because it sits a little heavy and you can definitely feel the 8 % creeping up in the back of the head ."

S"bought from a random gas station ; i asked my friend to bring me back a beer ( did n't care what it was , needed a night cap and he decided to be a funny man and buy this , um , concoction . this was earlier this year , but since the memory is sharp in my head and that i 'm not going to pay money to drink this again , i 'm still going to review it to provide a baseline for what is truly , truly an abombination against taste and decency . from what i remember , it 's a very pinkish , sickly looking beer , and you can tell it is full of artificial coloring . head is basically that of a can of soda , yuck . smell , i do n't remember the smell . i guess maybe a weaker v8 juice . i 'm sure it was n't pleasant . taste : oh god , the horror . imagine mixing watered down tomato juice , adding soft drink carbonation , random vegeta that sat in your fridger for two months , a bit of bud light , and you 'll have this vulgar little animal shitting in it 's own nest . it 's been a long time since i actually did have this , but honestly -- i had better malt liquor than this shit in a can . even the alchopop beverage , joose , tastes better than this rotten tomato . i did n't taste any clam. , either , i do n't really know if i wanted to . i do n't even know if i 'd call this a beer , to be honest , as well . i did forget how salty this was , and reading other reviews made me remember that `` quality . '' it 's very clear the saltiness is there to mask other flavors . that 's how awful this is . m : like a carbonated v8 juice ... ugh . d : none at all ; it 's low alcohol content and disgusting taste makes this really hard to want to drink this a lot ; it offers nothing to taste nor the `` getting shitfaced '' factor so many drinkers crave . i crave both . this gives neither . the absolute worst `` beer '' i 've ever had . whereas macro lagers are simply just tasteless water , this is just nasty , disgusting excrement from the bowels of hell . it only has a short tastyiness but that 's neither very strong , longlasting , nor important enough to counter its vile nature . how this stuff is so common is beyond me . does this actually sell ?"

S'2006 edition : pours a darkish , burnt , redish color . completely clear , which is surprising since i had heard this was a bottle conditioned beer . also no sediment on the bottom of the bottle ... strange . aroma consists of an orgy of malts and hops , as does the taste . tastes tingly on the tongue ; just an absolute rush of taste . incredible . as with other high gravity beers , this one might doom itself to being low on the drinkability scale . i think 2 or 3 would be the limit for drinking in one sitting , any more would result in a sugar-fueled hangover of the worse kind . tastes about the same as last years , which works for me .'

S"poured from the 12oz . brown bottle into a pilsner glass the beer was a light golden color with two fingers of fluffly white head . ample carbonation bubbles streamed up the sides of the glass and a nice sheet of lacing lined the glass . the smell had a good hop presence with a faint aroma of grain and malt . perhaps ever so slightly floral as well . an immediate hop presence on the palate but very controled and balanced so as not to make it approach a mild ipa . blended well with a malt presence to create a taste that despite its hoppiness has only a very mild and smooth bitterness to it . very crisp with each sip and well carbonated . a slight fruitty/estery taste in the background existes , but all flavors are nicely matched and balanced . medium to light body with a high degree of carbonation and a crisp , dry , finish . this was my first venture into the realm of pilsners coming from a large wealth of darker beers . although i do n't have much to compare it to insofar as style , i have to admit that i quite enjoyed this beer and its delicate flavors . it certainly ranks up there with beers that can be very easily sessioned , and overall found it more enjoyable than its current overall score might let on to some people ."

S"appearance - this is a super-cloudy light orange in color with a decent head . smell - this is very interesting . there are basically two bouquets to this ale . the first one is classic american dipa . the big , stiff piney hops and rich , caramel-laden malt scream west coast dipa . but then there is a belgian tripel kind of aroma . it 's behind the first one for sure , but i can pick up some fine belgian yeast and some traditional tripel spicing , particularly coriander . taste - ok , this is officially the freak . it 's like drinking two beers very similar to the notes i made about the smell . the american dipa is more prominent and that yeast aroma hardly showed up at all , but there is some classic belgian spicing to this beer that makes it a wonderful dipa/tripel hybrid . mouthfeel - this is bigger than medium-bodied but not full . it is exceptionally balanced and has some terrific carbonation . there is no real bitterness to the drink even though it is swimming in hops . drinkability - this is actually quite an easy-drinking ale . again , at the risk of sounding repetitive , the balance makes this a fabulous offering . the various flavors work in perfect harmony and produce a big , giant beer with what could easily be competing flavors but that work incredibly well together and go down like nobody 's business . grean flash pulled off a miracle with this effort - it is a unique beer that speaks to the boldness and creativity of the brewmasters . well done !"

S"i am very excited for this stout . although i reviewed key lime a bit earlier and found myself very disapointed . i hope this one is better . a : quite a bit of sediment on the bottom tried to leave most in the bottle . pour a nice black color . the head dissapoints ... there is none . s : smells of doughy yeast , dark chocolate , bit of coffee and some vanilla . i can pick up the smell of a s'more with a big whiff . t : dark chocolate and balck coffee . finishes with a but of earthy bitterness . im not getting the s'more taste as much as i did the smell . m : medium mouth feel . i like my stouts a creamier . finishes with a decent bitterness and wet . d : drinkability is just okay for me . i will finish the 12 oz bottle with ease but i do not need another . im comarison to the newly released fbs this is a huge dissapointment . it is just a average stout for me . the name and bottle marketing is better than the product inside ."

S"sampled on 3-10-07 batch 7761 bottled on 1-11-07 pours a very clear and very light golden color with bubble constantly rising to the top . a thin film of head is always present . smell is very light and thin . no real aromas to speak of , smells like a macro-brew . taste is similar to the smell , the really only discernible flavor is the bitterness from the hops . mouthfeel is good , very carbonated , but thats to be expected from the style . drinkability is very good . this beer is very light and easy to drink , and does not build up on the palate at all . overall , this is what an american macro-lager should be . but , if thats what i wanted i 'd buy a 30 of high life instead ."

S'poured a big fluffy white head atop a beautiful gold beer with good head retention i think this on has a little bit of carapils malt in it to achieve this . aroma is extremely light and the only thing i can detect is a little toasty bread . taste has a definite saaz hop character with a very mild malt balance that gets bolder after each sip . body is pretty good for the style though it is a little light and tends to make the hop flavors subside quickly . i would much rather have a trippel for the same price or at least a pine mountain pils from deschutes .'

S"pours a deep orangish copper/brown . bubbly head that settles at a thin film after about ten seconds . very strong pumpkin pie spice smell . clove , cinnamon , nutmeg , allspice , anise , all these and probably more are in there . there is also a fresh pumpkin smell like when you carve into a jack-o-lantern . flavor is malty sweet and fruity at first . more of that fresh pumpking smell/taste comes out . the spice takes over every other flavor quickly . in the end , the only other flavor is a hint of booze on my lips . i 've never been a fan of the spiced pumpkin beers . every fall i try to keep an open mind , but the spices always turn me off . it was hard to finish the bottle . if you are into pumpkin beers , this is a probably a great one . it 's just not for me ."

S"picked up a single of this when i saw it on the shelves after hearing so much about it . review is from notes taken on 5/25/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip glass . appearance : the pour is a rich coppery/cidery color ; starts with a 1/2 finger off-white head that fades immediately to nothing other than a couple of spotty wisps ; body is a little murky and cloudy ; a couple of washes and strands of lacing are left behind . smell : a great blend of piney and sweet tropical fruit-like hops ( like melon or mango ) and a very rich and honey sweet maltiness ; slight hint of vaporous alcohol and i 'm surprised this is n't more pronounced in the nose considering the especially high abv . taste : my god , this is definitely a sipper . a strong blend of the piney and mango-like hops and sweet honey-like malts along with a very strong presence of alcohol that definitely creates some burning in the mouth that lingers well into the aftertaste . it 's big , and it does deter from the other flavors just a bit , but really , when it 's this big and this good overall , who cares ? mouthfeel : body is pretty thick and syrupy ; carbonation is present , but smooth , soft and creamy ; a very moist stickiness is left all over the mouth ; the palate is left warm from that abv and as i mentioned , this carries into the aftertaste -- it also lingers in the belly . drinkability : moderate at best because of the abv and uber-sweetness ( which could be a little cloying if i attempted more than one -- not that i would , anyway ) ; beyond that though , the smell and taste are great and very enjoyable ."

S"this was definitely the first beer that i had ever tasted ( a long time a go and the only reason why i 'm reviewing it ) and did n't think i could finish it . last night while at a birthday party i tried to actually analyze the flavors instead of mindlessly downing it and found that it had light cereal grain ( first time i detected `` cereal grain '' and could recognize it ) , corn , slightly metallic ( even from a bottle ) , and undoubtedly there must be rice involved ( the abv has to come from somewhere ! ) . barely any hop presence . this stuff is bubbly and watery and hopefully cold . miller light probably has more of a pilsner , light barley malt taste in it but it still does n't make it much better . it has a strange afterbite in it that i can not pinpoint . this is soda water with a drop of bad tasting beer in it . yet it is drinkable because of how non-existent it is ( i gave it a 3.5 for drink ) so if you 're drinking/chugging as fast as you can you can catch a buzz ."

S"i poured my serving into a belgian 250ml glass . the head was prominent and carbonation effervescent . the color was a nice amber and clarity was good . the aroma revealed a bit of a yeasty smell and as it warmed more of the fruityness emerged in the scent . the inital sips are crisp with obvious belgian yeast generated flavors peeking through . mouthfeel is quite good as the body is pleasing and carbonation level appropriate . as the beer warms up , i get a clovey start with some cherry hints in the early taste . the drink starts `` bright '' and reveals some sweetness midway . after swallow , there are fruity notes followed by a tangy aftertaste that lasts a long time . the beer warms the stomach and the alcohol heat is noticeable . the most noticeable experience in tasting this beer is the long tangy aftertaste which endures for minutes . i did not accompany this beer with food and so there were no other flavors `` competing '' for my taste buds . without a `` food chaser , '' this beer experience will stay in your mouth for a notable period of time . the high alcohol and lingering tartness strongly impact the drinkability factor . this is a beer best enjoyed by having a modest serving and sharing the bottle with friends . perhaps serve with a sweet slightly-fruity desert such as tarte tatin ."

S"part of magic hat 's summer variety pack . 12 oz bottle with a really neat , old school tattoo with what look like hop vines coming out the sides of it . best if consumed before august 2009 . to my surprise , this one pours a clear , strawberry color ! there was a fizzy white head after the initial pour , but slowly faded to a light skimming of white lace on the top . no lacing detected . if i did n't know any better , i would think i was drinking faygo strawberry soda ! the nose is vegetal . believe it or not , i get the beet essence on the nose . slightly sweet with hints of grains in there , as well . mild sweetness carries over into the taste with the anticipated beet in the forefront . my brain is expecting strawberry , but the beer delivers semi-sweet beets instead . like picked up in the nose , i get a slight grainy-ness and a touch of pale malts in the mix as well . a tinge of bitter-like grains trails in the aftertaste . the body of this beer is light with high carbonation on the mouthfeel . magic hat definitely gets points for originality as it does provide to be a light , semi-refreshing beer with a unique flavor . would i run to the store and buy a six-pack of these ? no thanks , three is enough ."

S"2002 edition found on a back shelf in charles street liquors . 12oz capped bottle . a : bubbly and thick 1/4 '' golden brown head . fades slowly into thick lace and detached floating islands . dark ruby red near maroon in colour . hold it up to the light and it looks like nuclear cranberry juice . n : strong and rounded molassas/malt aromas , winey edges , past due vintage port centre . slight alcohol . p : bitter , bitter , bitter hops way up in front coated and undermined by vaguely sweet malt . the bitterness , however , dominates and is very sharp , chalky , powdery : citrus peel without the citrus , pine , tree bark , after dinner bitters , dried sage , bay leaves , file gumbo . finish is mildly and softly bitter , with slight orange syrup , cocoa powder , pine , subtle afterthoughts of brandy and cabernet sauvignon and syrah . m : spritzy carbonation , near perfect medium to full body , soft fade out into a long finish . notes : certainly the bitterest barleywine i have yet to try . crotchety for sure , the bitters are not the usual bittersweetness but more reminiscent of childhood learning lessons on what not to put into your mouth . compelling and complex ? yes , absolutely . easy to drink and savor ? not really . would actually like to try this one young . probably has more appeal for fernet-branca or gammel dansk guzlers than for old guardians and bigfoot 's .

S"this is my review of pyramid breweries unfiltered wheat apricot ale . i 'm not sure if this is the correct title . i purchased this in a six-pack from a grocery store , and it has an orange label . having tried several other hefweisen style beers , i would find this comparable to blue moon , except that here apricot flavor replaces the citrus hops . appearance is slightly murky straw yellow , as is classic for wheat beers . moderate 1/4 '' foam head , somewhat long-lasting larger bubbles . the smell is not excessive , barely noticeable , but not obtrusive , either . taste is not overly pungent . the apricot flavor is not sweet like peaches , but dry , and i found it less bitter than the citrusy hefeweisens , yet similar . there is a slight residual aftertaste of the apricot , and i wish it did n't seem quite so artificial . yet it 's relatively complimentary , and not excessive , like a raspberry flavored beer and definitely nothing as sweet as a soda-like lambic . yet somewhat ordinary construction . average mouthfeel for a hefeweissen ... a little cloudier than a bud , but not rich and creamy like a stout ... moderate to prickly carbonation . to me the drinkability was hindered by the predominence of the apricot aftertaste , which though dry , prevented resonance of hops and seemed a bit artificial . quaffable , forgettable ... but something a little different ."

S"this is one of the most disappointing brews i have so far in my life . i love russian imperial stouts , but this is something that is not good , in my opinion . the reviews were high , the trade came in , and beer poured beautiful , the taste sucked . the appearance is amazing . it pours a beautiful dark brown that comes into a great black that no light comes through . the head is beautiful , comes up to a dark brown frothy head that leaves a disgustingly fat sticky lace on the side . really a beautiful looking brew . the smell is where it started turning for the worst . the smell is that of metal , or aluminum . better yet , stick your hands into a jar of coins and mix it around a little . then smell your hand , that is what this brew smells like . the hops pop out with this smell with a liquor smell . the liquor smell is something that i was looking forward to in the taste , you can smell an earthy smell also that took me by surprise . the liquor taste is whiskey , something that i can take , but if it is done right . the taste is by far the worst part of this beer . i had to drink like five drinks to confirm that it was not good . i thought that maybe i sipped it wrong the first two times . i honestly could not believe my taste buds , i still do n't . it was gnarly , like a aluminum-whiskey-sour-hop taste that was not good . i actually am saving the other half of the bottle for a buddy who 's opinion i somewhat respect on beer . i need to see if he likes it or not because i feel like i might be going crazy . it would be a drainpour if i did n't give the rest away . it has a whiskey hop taste that makes me do a sour baby face . this has some undertones of chocolate and coffee and some vanilla . it just does not taste good at all . the mouthfeel is a really carbonated and hoppy ris . i have to stop reviewing this just for the fact i am so saddened how bad it was . the look was beautiful ! the taste suffers . i would never buy this ever again . what an interesting experience . overall not good , i feel like i have to say sorry . sorry j"

S"i almost never like flavoured beers . very rarely have i found a spiced ale or fruit beer ( real or imitation fruit ) that i enjoyed for very long . this , then , came as a nice surprise . caveat : i do like pina coladas , at least on a beach in mexico . appearance did n't denote anything unusual , but i could smell the coconut as soon as the bottle was open . the nice thing is , however , it was n't a fakey , artificial coconut aroma ( or flavour , for that matter ) , but reminded me of the real thing . i would n't want to drink this all day , but in a small dose it was very nice and a nice refreshing buffer between the other beers of the evening . one negative i 'd offer up is that the coconut flavours are so surprising that they pretty much overwhelm anything else the beer has to offer ( or , at least , i ca n't remember anything else ) . nevertheless , of the two mongozo-line beers i tried this evening , this was by far the better ."

'' s - i get a nice , but mild , nose of slightly burnt caramel , banana split . addition of the sediment contributes an odd pungent funk , maybe a hint of plastic . t - slightly sweet banana bread , tasty . alcohol noticeable in the taste , adds a pleasant spicy/bitter note . phenolic . raisins , maple ; a note of licorice even worked its way through , i thought . pretty complex . f - well-carbonated but not too burpy . alcohol burns the nose a bit on the way down . d - i do n't know what it is , this seems to drink even bigger than it really is . it 's filling liquid sustenance ... and the 7.4 % abv seems to drink more like 10-11 % . very good , and i would buy again , but i 'll be satisfied with the one bomber for now . would seem to be a close cousin of aventinus , as others have noted ."

S"ah yes , another random single from trader joe 's . a 12 oz . bottle into a pint glass , this stout pours a deep blackish brown with a few ruby highlights and a thick tan head . retention is only moderate but never settles below a tan surface film . lots of roasted malt and chocolate on the nose , though not a lot of variety and not very volatile . definite hop presence later on which intermingles in an odd way with the chocolate . i 'm actually picking up some sour notes . not what i expected yet i keep trying to stir them up ? ? ( noted only upon firm agitation ) taste follows with roasted malt and chocolate , but is a bit thin and a bit too carbonated on the feel , at least initially . thus robbing the tongue of much finish on the beer . decent drinkability yet the body just is n't really there , improving a bit with warming and less carbonation . note : says irish dry stout clearly on the label . best served a bit warm , maybe 60 f ."

S"a- pours a clear tangerine hue with a lot of visible carbonation bubbles present . very `` fizzy '' 2 finger head that dies out fast leaving behind no lacing . s- smell is pumpkin with heavy spices , most notably nutmeg followed by cinnamon . very sweet . t- taste is super light . a bit of pumpkin along with a malty backbone but not nearly as distinctive as a lot of the other top pumpkin beers . crisp and smooth but there just is n't a whole lot of flavor . m- light and crisp , very refreshing . d- the drinkability of this is by far the best of any pumpkin ale i 've ever had just because it is so light . a lot of people write off pumpkin beers because they are too gimiky with tons of spices and pumpkin or cloying . this one is neither and it would be easy to knock a few glasses back . with that being said , i respected the balance and would drink it again if someone gave me one , but i would n't seek it out . glad to have had the opportunity to try it ."

S'poured from a 500 ml . bottle into a standard pint glass . pours a clear deep copper with an inch of slightly off white head . offers moderate retention and lacing . smell is light , with a dose of caramel malt mingling with even lighter notes of noble hops and a touch of roasted nuttiness . hops are more evident , and woody in nature , through the foam . nose improves with warming notably . malt notes carry forward to the flavor , offering a well carbonated and moderately lingering close of light caramel . slightly sweet but not a detraction . nut notes are less evident on the tongue than the nose . smoothly carbonated and with a well balanced malt structure that yields a decent feel . unexciting perhaps , but unobtrusive as well , and very drinkable as a result . offers enough structure to hold its own and shows no obvious weakness .'

S"i love a good stout . but a stout has to be drinkable . this stout was overly sweet , sickeningly sweet , with little or hardly any carbonation . when poured a small head can be seen and the booze in this pitch black mixture strips the lacing from side of the glass . smell is a bit overcooked with hints of dark chocolate , some fruits , and some spices but mostly booze . i 've had similar and even higher % abv brews that hid the booze much better than this one . bells , i love your line , and a few of your beers may be my absolute favorites ... . this stout is not one of them ."

S"bought this as part of a mix-a-six pack . i was looking forward to trying this beer but was left dissapointed . this beer pours a pale hazy yellow with light carbonation and looks like someone mixed lemonade with some soda water . the nose is almost non existent but does have traces of lemon and some spices . the taste is quite different than what i 'm used to . it is quite fruity but with an artifical aftertaste that is pretty dry as well . hoegaarden has a nice mouthfeel with light carbonation but the taste just kind of kills the enjoyment overall for me . all in all probably not bad on a really hot day but not one i will search for again ."

S"the memory of this beer haunts me , much like an exceptionally well written novel or an exquisitely filmed movie . there 's nothing incredibly impressive in it at first , and it does n't really stand out as being remarkable under scrutiny ; yet it remains in memory , and that is a sign of brilliance . i 'm continually reminded the delicate combination of malt and hop that gave it such a nice drinkability , and for that reason i 've given it a five in that category . it pours a crystal clear mahogany body that 's capped by a thin layer of creamy off-white foam . the head drops , but it maintains a creamy collar and leaves some thin lace . the aroma is fresh and clean with a delicately toasted and lightly caramelish malt , and a lightly mineral-like characteristic that fades as it warms . the body is light and crisp in the mouth with a very fine carbonation . the flavor delivers a combination of almost juicy , toasted malt and spicy hops . it 's not really complicated , but it is most compelling ! it finishes with a short , lingering note of sweetish malt and spice . well-balanced , refreshing , and highly drinkable with enough character to keep it interesting throughout several servings . certainly worth trying ."

S"smoke is an odd smell in beers . they come off as a strong sour note at the top without much sweetness . clear alcohol notes are in there . the roasted malt is there at the finish , perhaps a touch of liquorish with a hint of coffee in the nose . i want to say vanilla and chocolate but i do n't think those are in there . i 'm mostly picking up the alcohol , smoke , liquorish , and some coffee . pours brown , turns black in the glass , with good head , great retention , and just enough body . impressive to say the least . beers like this make me wish i knew more from those taste wheels . the malt is n't sweet or sour , the flavor hits the front of the tongue which indicates not sour , but the smoke is clearly a very unique flavor for the malt . clear notes of chocolate ( very much on the dark bitter bakers chocolate side , even more than most ) , coffee . there is n't any sweet notes in this beer . i think it would be amazing with sweeter foods , but i have nothing like that to try with it . i can vouch form past experience that this stuff is just amazing with roast chicken and bbq . a rare thing with beer is that imo this is far better with food than by itself . i highly recommend pairing this with food . great carbonation gives this beer a lot of drink ability and a creamy mouth feel . that said it 's a touch to thin all things considered . i think stone for this very `` unstone like '' beer . it 's a very different porter and a truly interesting experience . scored as an alone drink and not as something to pair with food . scores would go up in taste to with the right pairing . by itself this is very interesting but does n't rank that highly ."

' every hop facet is touched upon : an initial resin blast yields way to citrus , leaving a spruce forest in its wake . flavor is an incredibly hard hitting but wholly quaffable arrangement of resinous spruce and pine with some citrus notes that are balanced nicely by a honed malt character containing biscuit , caramel , some burnt sugars , and vanilla . palate is quite full for the style , leaving a sap like coating on the palate . a slight warming booziness sneaks in unexpectedly but is quite welcomed . my favorite of the style to date ."

S"on tap at rustico appearance : poured light gold and very clear with a small white head that faded fairly quickly . ample lacing was left behind in the glass . smell : what smell ? had a very hard time trying to distinguish any aroma from the pint glass . if anything , maybe a hint of citrusy hops but you really had to try hard to find any discernable fragrances . taste : extremely smooth with not a whole lot going on in the beginning or the middle . this beer is all about the finish . the beginning is fair to middling at best with maybe a touch of bittering hops to keep things interesting otherwise not much going on . the middle moves things along to the finish where this beer makes it mark . the finish is all bittering , grapefruit rind like hops that linger long on the tongue well after the swallow . if it was n't for the finish , then i would swear this was some sort of euro macro . the finish makes this interesting , but then again i 'm so used to american ipa 's and the aggessive hoppiness that encompasses them that i might not really have a true understanding of a british ipa and their subtle complexities . mouthfeel : somewhat thin with ample carbonation , crisp and dry . drinkability : a true session beer . nothing to here to wear out the palate . goes down very clean with a nice bitterness in the end . nothing i would go out of the way for , but i would n't dismiss it either . definitely worth a try ."

S"utopias really transcends what beer is . unlike some other `` beers '' out there , this does n't undergo any ice distillation or other techniques to increase the abv unnaturally . it is 100 % ninja made . this beer in the right time and place is a great sipper . i 'd schedule at least 30 minutes for a 2oz pour to do it right . in this situation , utopias is a complex son-of-a-bitch . flavor pop up all over the place including vanilla , maple syrup , brown sugar , bourbon , sherry , caramel , and dark fruits . there are more in there but my brain ca n't handle that many sensations at once . i almost think of it as a cognac or sherry more than as a beer . either way , it is interesting for sure . also of note , when i 've had it on cask before it was n't carbonated . there was a touch of carbonation and decent head this time because it was served out of a quarter keg ( yes , a fucking quarter keg of utopias ! ! ) . also , this is one boozy beer . the full 27 % abv is n't apparent but about 15 % of it is and it is hot . in a different time and place it blends beautifully with canadian breakfast stout . the coffee and chocolate from the cbs add a great sensation to the beer and also drop the abv to a completely reasonable 20ish percent . in a third time and place it is the hardest yet most satisfying kegstand in the world . this beer is to be respected or it will kick your utopi-ass ."

S'old woody 2003 was served from a 12 oz . bottle . in a pint glass , the beer was rich reddish nut-brown color , and was topped by a light tannish head that quickly disappeared altogether . the nose nearly knocked me off of my feet ... big booziness , dark roasted chocolate , and a smooth yet robust bourbony maltiness . i found it to be quite enticing once i got used to the overt booziness . the taste was monsterous and boozy as well , reflecting the nose closely . the rich roasty nutty-chocolate malt base was soaked in a bourbon-like booziness , and had accents of vanilla and earthiness . this gives way to a potently bitter finish , though it is difficult to determine if this comes from hops or alcohol . i enjoyed the level of sweetness thoughout : it was toned down compared to many old ales . all of this sounds off-putting , but i found that booziness worked very well with the malt profile and finish ... and made for a very enjoyable experience . the body was full enough for the flavors but the carbonation was certainly too low ... making the flavor less lively than it could have been . as one would expect from a beer of this intensity , it is not very drinkable ... 12 oz is more than plenty . in the end , a walloping bear of a beer with character , best enjoyed in cold weather as a warmer . i imagine this one would do very well in the cellar for at least 2 years .'

S'served on tap . stood with a light orange hue with no true cloudiness from yeast , and with very poor head retention . the aroma was of faint cherries and either rice or flaked maize and very little of the fruity wheat that i was expecting . the taste was nearly a duplicate of the aroma , how ever the grainy , corn/rice feeling became stronger , and much more cloying . the mouth feel was below average . the wheat flavor lasted only moments and the corn/rice impression stuck like glue , furthermore the cherries were but a fleating memory by this time . although , the beer was quite drinakble and would make a good session beer , however i would opt for something that would be a little closer to par . notes : i was somewhat dissappointed with this brew , from an otherwise outstanding brew pub . on an interesting note , blendingthis with their new higher gravity apa makes quite the concoctuion .'

S"on tap at pizza port solana beach . 11 % abv , apparently . copper colored with slight haze . more a collar than a head , but that 's due to the pour . the nose is dank , weedy , very pungent . grapefruit , herbs , earthy hoppiness . perhaps a hint of malt buried beneath the hop aroma . flavors of grapefruit and earthy , weedy hops are dominant . herbal toward the finish with a hint of toasted , caramelized malt . bitterness is strong and mildly astringent , which inhibits drinkability a bit . the mouthfeel is substantial , on the heavy side for the style but quite dry - or at least the sweetness is covered up by the hops . a very good dipa overall , but i 've had a few better ones from pizza port ."

S"11.2oz bottle at delaney 's , poured into its signature westmalle chalice . cheers to proper glassware ! a : lightly hazy medium-amber body with a finger of frothy white head . less than stellar retention in the wide goblet , but i 'll give proper glassware the benefit of the doubt . the overall picture is lovely . s : bready malt dominates , accented by some delicate fruity esters , a touch of floral hoppiness , and a healthy amount of booze . the chalice does n't make it smell very intense , but it 's clearly a refined and well-balanced tripel . t : starts out with supremely dry , bready malt , followed by a wave of yeasty fruit , then finally some earthiness and alcohol . the 9.5 % is n't shy , but it never really distracts from the beer 's depth of flavors , either . it only improves as it warms , too , getting fruitier and spicier . excellent . m : surprisingly light bodied , and pleasantly effervescent . blissful . d : not at all bad for the style , but not nearly as good as it could be due to the apparent alcohol . notes : great , classic tripel . i liked it far better this time than the first time i tried it over a year ago , but in my opinion it still pales in comparison to st. bernardus tripel . the flavors are beautifully balanced and integrated , but the harsh booziness really takes away from the overall package , keeping it from being truly world class . cheers !"

S"this beer was a hard one to review . pours a dark , almost opaque black in color with a large tan head that sits for a while then disappears into a thin ring . the pour led me to believe this was a thinner version of an oatmeal stout then i am used to . the smell was not something i 'd pride this beer on . it included some faint oatmeal grains , roasted malt , toffee and even fainter coffee bean , behind what i i feel is like a yoo-hoo smell . at first sip you know this beer is betrayed lancelot style by its smell . despite its thin body this beer packs a punch of solid roasted malt , coffee , toffee , cream , maybe slight brown sugar and other sweeter flavors pull through with a dry finish . ultimately this is a oatmeal stout to session . while most flavors are not as pronounced as some other famed oatmeal stouts such as sam smith and troegs , this beer suprised me with an abundance of flavor . if they boosted up the body of this beer alittle bit more id have rated it higher , but nonetheless this is a winter session beer of choice ."

S"acquired at the belgium comes to cooperstown 2007 festival at brewery ommegang from a very generous dfh employee . poured into a snifter , the color is light brown with a thin , bubbly white head . not much head retention , but reappeared with a little swirl . the aroma was very sweet . lots of caramel . the taste was even sweeter . very malty and slightly boozy . carbonation was low and the alcohol was definitely noticable as the beer was a bit `` hot '' in my mouth . decent flavor , but could probably benefit from a little more carbonation ."

S"picked this up on a business trip . with the high abv , the little hotel glass worked perfectly ! pours with just about no head . very clear copper . could be confused for a similar amount of whiskey . smell is of sweet citrusy hops and metal . first sips is very welcome . i needed a hop fix and this hit the spot . citrus hops flavor is first and strongest . also in there is the strictly bitter hop flavor , in the aftertaste , or if you really pay attention past the citrus . rounding it out is the sugary honey flavor . even though there was no head , carbonation is spot on . drinkability : i may be getting a false sense of comfort here because i had a big dinner , but not feeling it too badly yet . even with all this flavor , i 'd like a lower abv . a few bottles are great , but i 'd rather stock up on nugget nectar since it has a lower abv . is it better than pliny the younger ? as far as i can remember , very similar to me ."

S'my first review , cheers ! ! ! 12oz bottle , bought a 6 pack at the local walmart in oak grove ky. ( a ) has a very distinct golden color , poured with light carbonation that created about a 1/4in head , that quickly disspated . ( s ) a noticable cherry smell , very fruity , with a hint of hops . ( t ) the taste was nothing like the smell . there was just a hint of cherry , most dissapointing . ( m ) the body is very light a thin , which dissapointed me as i was expecting a more wheat beer like body . ( d ) the beer is very easy to drink , my wife had one for herself and enjoyed it , and she is not a beer drinker at all . this is an excellent beer to pour for your non-beer drinking friends to open them up to the possibilitys of the better beers that are out there .'

S"nice bottle presentation and cool labeling . i 'm a little biased about this brewery because i bought a sampler a couple weeks back that was full of tasty beers . the smell is nice . almost licorice , but definitely an overwhelming sweetness . as i poured the beer i got a great waft of scent . tasty , tasty tasty ! rich chocolate , caramel , toasted almond flavor . does have a fairly present alcohol flavor , but the acidity does not overwhelm the sweetness . the aftertaste does continue the sweetness but has a bit of a bitter alcohol feel too . no quadrupel is considered very drinkable to me . i can drink a bomber and that 's about it . i could drink more , but i would n't enjoy it as i did the first bottle . so with that said , this was fairly drinkable for a quad . it did n't leave an overwhelming aftertaste ."

S'third coast pours a crystal yellow with some sunshine and light sediment , whoops . the head was a white frothiness that quickly dissipated but a little remained through the tasting . the nose is limited overall . some grainy characteristics are presence , on the lighter end . hints of biscuit & a light bready aroma . some noticeable yeast notes , specifically acetaldehyde . a bit of dms and diacetyl as well . there is a light hoppy note that is more lemony but some alcohol heat as well . the taste is also very limited as well . the malt comes out nicely with a good grainy backing . a bit sweet would have liked a bit more bitterness to balance . but some light lemon and orange in the finish . the yeast is a distract with some sulfur , ok for style , but big acetaldehyde and esters , figs mostly . some diacytl as well but lighter versus the nose . the body is nice considering style . a good malt backing that lingers into the body gives it a bit more omph . some slickness but the yeast is just too much of a distraction . hard to hide some of those flavors in such a light beer .'

S"huge thanks go out to wade ( ba sprucetip ) for sending a random box of generosity my way from the great midwest . killer box wade , thanks dude . pours a clear and vibrant blood red ruby color with a small white head that retains ok , but leaves minimal lacing . nose is full of dark english malts , some slight peat , almost a sour peat like nose , some light smoke as well , but deep fruity malt sugar is king in the nose here . taste follows with an excellent english malt profile , some lighter peat notes , which is nice . i like it when its noticeable and enjoyable like it is in this beer without being overpowering . i hate it when scottish or scotch ales are like getting junk-punched with a giant thing-hand of degoba bog myrtle . minimal smokiness . a nice dark fruit sweetness carries the profile from the middle on , and leads to a suprisingly bitter finish . certainly more hops in here than your average scottish ale . now i do n't intend to indicate that it is a bitter beer , as it is not , and it is clearly and dominantly malt driven as it should be . but for the style it is quite crisp , hoppy , and unusually dry on the finish , which is a nice take , but not to style by traditional standards . but i like it , so f*ck style . the dark fruit profile lingers on into the finish with some almost rock candy like sugars lurking in the background . the mouthfeel is right where it should be as far as viscosity . i would like the tiniest bit less carbonation in this one , but really not gripeworthy in that regard . unusually dry and slightly bitter on the finish , which , again , is not to style , but shaking things up is not exactly out of fff 's sphere of comprehension and i commend them for it . drinkability is where this one really shines , as this beer is very easy to pack away in a style that is usually pretty heavy and not so sessionable . the abv is also not anywhere near noticeable . excellent here . overall , a very enjoyable beer . maybe not 100 % to style in some areas , but its mostly there , and if we all made the same scotch ale , then all of them would be boring . i like the dryness on the finish , i like the extra hop presence ( even if it is n't that much extra , its fun to see what its like ) and i really like how drinkable this beer is for the style . an excellent beer , would love to try the barrel aged version as i think we might have a backwoods bastardish experience . a"

S"it has a nice potent fruity belgian yeast smell with a bit of berry from the currants and some sweet kinda grainy malts and maybe some earthy hop presence as well . i know it has some characteristics of a cheaper adjunct beer the appearance and somewhat the taste but it was made so that is was pleasing the band who said they liked fruity alcoholic beverages and mexican lagers . this is like a craft beer version of the 2 combined . with that being said i get a bit of spicy fruity hop then with some cereal sweet malt ending with some fruity berry tastes from the currants and belgian yeast and a very subtle earthy hoppiness to finish off the taste . for such a standard style its has a nice big taste to it . you ca n't really make a belgian golden ale taste any better or `` extreme '' than this unless if you hop it to the hills and have a crazy alcohol percentage . what i like best about this beer is the thicker almost creamy almost syrupy mouthfeel for it being a yellow golden beer . the body of this beer almost reminds me of some of the lower alcoholic stout beers which tells you this beer is made with quality right there . i also like that it hides the 7 percent so well its as drinkable and goes down as easy as any of those adjunct lagers . i can understand why some people do n't like this beer that much or its nothing special but for the style of it being a golden ale its amazing.i think the problem is that a lot of people do n't like golden ales ? with that being said i recommend this beer as another well made line of beers in dogfish 's music beers ."

S"the only good thing in my book about coors light is that it 's not bud light or miller lite . aside from this though ... as for some more specifics ... a : its the same color going in as going out ... s : its best not to , but if you must or do so by mistake it has a tangy metal stale beer sort of hint to it . t : its like water , but worse . pretty unremarkable to bad . though it does have a somewhat sweet aftertaste that makes drinking it en mass not overly daunting . m : its very light and bubbly d : why a 3.5 ? not because i 'd ever willingly want to drink this , but if its a situation where many many beers are going to be consumed then coors is far from as bad as it gets . though in a normal situation when enjoyment is a priority , then i 'd give it a .5 as i could never get excited about drinking it ."

S"on tap at trumbull kitchen in hartford ct . this beer is very similar to sierra nevada pale ale , and is , in my opinion , an upgrade over hooker 's apa . very clear , amber color . a well made beer overall -- it drinks like an ipa although with the intensity of a pale ale . was suprised at how good it was ."

S"i had a big 22 oz bottle of this at the stir crazy asian restaurant in woodfield mall . a - the bottle shows a crazy half-deer , half-dragon creature called a kirin , and the the brew pours clear , golden , and a shade darker than most macro lagers . the head is one finger for a few seconds before reducing to a collar . s - thin and rice-y , with some sweet malt and 40 oz malt-liquor funk notes . t - sweet and malty , with surprisingly noticeable alcohol and a nice hop tang at the end . m - crisp , clean , and palate cleansing . this is an excellent food beer , especially for hot asian stir fry . d - this is n't anything other than what it 's supposed to be . an easy drinking food beer , or an excellent pick for an all night super-session . this is a nice beer for gulping , not sipping ."

S'i used to drink these from a can in high school and wondered what all the fuss was about beer in general ... awful . anyway , a friend had a few bottles in his fridge and i decided to see if there was any difference ... appearance : pale yellow smell : none that i could detect . taste : watered down to almost nothing , but what little there was was not offensive . mouthfeel : a beer needs viscosity to have mouthfeel , no ? this is water . drinkability : pretty good if you just finished mowing the lawn on a 90 degree day and are feeling a bit dehydrated .'

S"$ 3.09 at merchants for a 12oz bottle . 8.0 % abv . this one seems interesting ... a scottish style ale brewed in belgium . pours out to a very dark chestnut , forming a large soapy tan light tan head with average retention and some mild lacing . carbonation is mild to moderate . the aroma is filled with dark fruit ... i get prunes , raisins , a little sour milk when swirled , fruity esters , distant smoke and alcohol . the mouthfeel is smooth with a medium-dense body and pillowy carbonation . the taste begins with dark fruits and some moderate sweetness , then is unfortunately marred by a strong and pervasive metallic sheen throughout . some roasted wood and soap are in the finish , and some chemical bitterness , like hop extract is in the aftertaste . overall , quite sweet , almost saccharinized . quite rich as well . one bottle will be enough . a decent brew , but a little too sweet and artifical tasting . the metallic taste also hurts it 's drinkability ."

S"my old friend.. one extra overall point for the bottle caps . we played pbr poker every monday night in college . a good staple . good for sharing , and never leaves you feeling cheaped out . taste is balanced , and slightly on thebitter side for some macros . although corn might be present , there is a malt presence as well , and the hops leave a good solid bittering , as well as a slight grassy skunkyness that works for the beer , strong hints of ( banana ) drinkability is out of this world . i could sip or chug 12 in a night easy , as long as i eat a good meal and stay hydrated . good for having drinking competitions which you beer snobs out there might not be familiar with . i could go on but i 'm sure most of you have had pbr before ."

S"the beer pours a hazy orange , and smells like grilled sweet peaches . it tastes sweet and smooth , with flavors of caramel , dark honey , grapes and peaches , and wraps up with a nice , light hoppy bitterness that was well balanced in with the other flavors . everything about this beer was really well put together -- it was lightly carbonated and felt smooth in the mouth , and i probably could have guzzled it . i was wary to try an esb but it was a great introduction to the style and something i 'll definitely order again . it 's a pretty fantastic beer , something i 've been recommending to people who are wary to try something too much in any direction ."

S"i had this at on tap at a baltimore pub a few blocks from my work . i swear you could add a couple drops of red food coloring to miller lite and end up with the same product as backfin . now , as far as cheap college beers go , i rather like miller lite , but i expected more from a locally produced micro . color is red , looks good . approx . 1 '' thick off-white head that left moderate lacing . taste is very grainy like corn or buscuit , much like miller , only with a slight hint of hops at the end . the mouthfeel is thin , however , this does make it a good thirst-quencher when eating crabs . but if it came down to it , and it were between backfin or miller at restaurant , though the backfin is better , i 'd save myself the cost of a `` premium '' beer and get the miller . not a bad beer , but not very good either . unremarkable ."

S'12/19/2002 bottle sampled 03/12/2004 at the maproom good pour , fairly muddy , with some drab browns , yellows and oranges . good light caramel colored head . aroma of vegetables , beet sugar ? , dry pulpy hops and ripe brown fruits ( pears , bananas , mangos ) . starts out immensely sweet , huge candied sugar taste dominates the palate . mouthfeel is extra-super-double full and slightly syrupy , definitely chewy . raisins , prunes , figs , dates , more sugar and alcohol . yes , definitely an intense alcohol flavor . alcohol adds bitterness and attempts to dry this out , but cant , this is so sweet . finishes sharp and acidic due to the alcohol , with some sweet caramel flavors and more raisins . i thought raison detre was sweet enough without having to up it to this level . i guess if they added more hops apparency , it wouldnt be the same beer , but it needs something , this stuff is just plain brutal . interesting celery flavor though , yes , that definitely reminds me of celery .'

S"picked this up at a local store , and did not realize the whole thing with this beer is a `` smoked '' flavor . i ca n't stand the smoked flavor , so i am trying to be nice , but this just is n't my thing . bottle looks old , i feel like i am back in time . cracked the bottle , and it literally smells like dip to me . i am scared to drink it . good pour , nice head , dark color but light at the same time , not a heavy beer . 1st sip , tastes very smokey . very malty , but nice and light , if they got rid of the smokedness i would probably really dig this beer . i am a little disappointed , but more with myself because i should not have purchased this beer . seems like other people like it so i think it 's just personal preference , but i feel like i am drinking beer , with a bk smokehouse burger mixed in . not for me , sorry . i usually dig the german beer too . one thing i will say is that the smokey flavor tastes more authentic than i have had in american beers , so they probably did this right ."

S'pours an extremely pale yellow color with a light , airy white head . decent retention and very nice lacing . i seem to prefer my white ales to actually appear nearly white ... go figure . i dig the nose here as well . not much orange or other citrus , but plenty of coriander . i actually get more of a malty smell than the typical tangy wheat . very much reminds me of apple jacks cereal . the taste provides more of a wheat and orange feel than the nose indicates , but still leans toward the lighter spice side of the witbier spectrum , a la the modern day hoegaarden . refreshing and clean tasting , but a bit on the thin side and not quite as carbonated as most wits . being a fan of the style , there is always room in my fridge for this one !'

S"appearance : again i found myself reaching for my trusty belgian tulip and i gave this beer a nice tilted pour and got a nice one inch head that floated on top of the honey orange colored liquid with much grace . as i was coming to the end of the bottle i must have unsettled a little bit of the yeast cake because i got a few floaters in my glass but nothing to get overly excited about . as i gave it a swirl i 'm getting medium to high amounts of of lacing which creeps down the sides of the glass slowly . in my usual fashion i held the glass up to the light and noticed that a pretty good amount of light is shining through ( almost clear ) which really brings out the vibrant gold and orangy colors that this beer has to offer . smell : this beer screams of complexity ! right up front the bourbon hits you while the maple syrup is too far behind it . with undertones of vanilla , oak , and something that reminds me of toasted marshmallows i ca n't wait to drink this beer . i do n't plan to wait any longer so i 'm going to dig in right now . taste : oh man is this a beer or a sweet manhattan ? as in the nose the bourbon takes the front seat but you do n't get bowled over with the typical burn or heat of whiskey . but make no mistake some heat is present but it seems to wrap around the syrup and makes me want to eat some pancakes . as the beer gets warmer i 'm getting something like faint cinnamon with fluff marshmallow in the finish which might i add is very long and warming with oaky notes . drinkability : what a great beer to bounce back with after reviewing dogma , this is really what i needed . heavy , complex , sticky , and sweet this really hit the spot . while i do love a great bourbon i really enjoy bourbon aged beers . in my opinion barrel aging adds a incomparable layer of depth to just about any beer . in this case where they took maple soaked bourbon barrels and made a solid wheat wine it was a equation for liquid heaven . this beer is very limited so if you can find it i 'd be sure to grab it ... hell grab two and see what some age does to this beer . i 'd have to say i think this will be a new favorite to add to my list of great beers ."

S"a : very dark with generous head . light does n't permeate except for a tiny malty ruby red at the bottom . 4 s : typical ss yeast . reminds me of the oatmeal stout . after careful deliberation i actually think the smell/taste is kind of reminiscent of a cardboard box with fermenting apple juice/apple cider splashed on the sides . 4 t : excellent . malty toffee/coffee . i really like the sweet toffee and the earthy coffee , which includes a sort of bitter aftertaste like an espresso . the espresso notes linger in the mouth but the bitterness does n't . 4 m : excellent . nicely carbonated . 4 d : i could drink this all night easily ( if it was n't so expensive as an import ) . has enough complexity to keep from getting boring , but the 5 % makes it readily drinkable . 5 i do think strongly flavoured food will drown out a lot of the flavor of this beer ( as i experienced ) as perhaps the flavor is a bit subtle , but that 's hardly a bad thing ; and is to be expected for the style and alcohol content . make sure you let it warm for a bit before drinking ."

S"an old stand by when nothing else is available ( and when it 's on sale for $ 5 a sixer at lowe 's foods ) . an agressive pour yields a hazy amber yellow beer topped with a fluffy , loose white head of medium large bubbles . head is short lived and leaves not a trace of lace . smell is dominated by sugary sweet orange and spice tones followed by a hint of lemon and buttery wheat . too sweet and lacking in depth and complexity . flavor is citrus sweet with cinnamon , clove , and corriander . it almost tastes like an orange creamsicle . a little character from the unmalted wheat comes through on the finish , but it is too little , too late . too sweet and unbalanced . the orange flavor almost has to be artificial , is it ? big bubbles of quickly dyeing carbonation land to a flat mouthfeel supported by a light , watery body . in spite of all it 's shortcomings , it is still easy to drink , almost like soda . 5 $ a sixer ... good for budget drinking or for cooling off on a hot day . i can hardly even compare it to troublette or ommegang witte ."

S"bought this about 6 months ago , cellared it since then . double dead guy actually tastes like a fairly simple beer to me , although i have trouble pinpointing the specifics . it 's a dark orange color , and a tan head , but with little lacing . a sweet caramel smell is there , and it 's also present in the taste . i actually liked this better when it was colder ( 45 degrees ) . i find this brew surprisingly drinkable , and would actually default to that word to describe it"

S"when i was browsing the store i must have been in the mood for an actual cookie because upon seeing the label i had to go for it . a : pours belgian blonde , considerable carbonation and head retention , moderately cloudy , noticeable yeast . s : not actually that fragrant , but picking up some citrus , banana . t : not that far from from what you 'd expect from blonde ales but lacking in complexity . definitely not noticing anything resembling cookie/biscotti flavors other than up-front sweetness . not sure how to describe the finish except for a noticeable but not overwhelming off-flavor . m : lively carbonation but offset with over-stickiness . d : i think the trouble is i 'd rather have almost any standard belgian strong/blonde ale . it 's not worthless , just not noteworthy in any way . the only thing i actually like is the picture of the cookie on the label ."

S"poured from a 12 oz . bottle . appearance - pours a dark mahogany with a creamy tan , one-finger head . changes a lot under some light to a bright red . no lacing . smell - wow . huge nose . lots of christmas-y spices . most of all i 'm reminded of ginger , then some nutmeg and molasses . there 's some malt in there as well . overall , it 's an incredibly strong smell . it smells great , but it might be difficult to drink if the taste is just as strong . it 's just a little too much . taste - definitely not quite as strong as the smell , thankfully , but still pretty potent . the flavors seem to meld more in the taste . after several sips , there 's a spice here that i just ca n't seem to discern . i think it 's some ginger , but it 's difficult to say for sure . there 's also some breadiness in the dark malt finish , which is the best part of the taste . the spiciness is good , but it just feels a bit overdone to me and makes it difficult to drink . mouthfeel - fairly thick and a bit sticky . not a lot , but i definitely appreciate it for a winter drink . might be better with a little less carbonation , but overall definitely what i like for a cold night . drinkability - definitely better for sipping . the strong spicy flavor would make impossible for me to have more than one in a row ."

S"red wine glass , from bottle . bacchus pours clear & blood-red with a thin reddish head . the nose is sour with distant hints of chocolate , but otherwise difficult to decode . in flavor it 's also sour , but milder than some sour ales and more citric rather than lactic . it 's also quite toasty . apple and lemon dominate the overtones , and the aftertaste , which is faint , has hints of bitter orange and lavender . in the mouth this is , like other sour ales , quite refreshing , and not caustic like a gueuze . i was looking for something like rodenbach but not , and i found it ; while nowhere near as complex or fulfilling as that ale , bacchus is a competently-crafted sour belgian ale which deserves a second look ."

S"on tap into pint glass at o'briens sd 8.5.09 . clear golden brew one finger head quick dissipation with some decent lacing . overwhelming hop presence in the nose , if there is any malt character it is hidden . hop bomb , bitter and piney with a bit of grapefruit on the taste buds . the only beer i can compare this to bitterness-wise is ruination . decent mouthfeel , with a fairly dry finish . at this abv one pint will suffice , thanks , though the alcohol is very well hidden . to be honest , i was a bit disappointed , this beer was lacking in balance , but that 's the point , is n't it ? recommended for hopheads , though a craft newbie would head straight back to macroswill after tasting this bitter hopbomb ."

S"750ml paper wrapped bottle , serving of it poured into a goblet smell is typical , mild hops with a sweetness and yeasty meld taste was no surprise , a hopped up belgian pale ale , not sure i would classify this as a strong pale ale , but i 'm usually not sure about turning on red either . this brew has a sweet taste considering this is advertised as a hoppy brew , in my opinion , i notice the sweetness more than anything . i ca n't wait till belgium has the `` stones '' to throw in a crap load of hops into their bpa 's . but overall this is a great beer , which hides its abv pretty darn well , i 'll gladly buy another ."

S'pours a hazy golden color with a large fuffly head . the aroma is phenolic almost smoky in nature . a nice sweet taste with a smudgy , slightly unappealing bitterness . lots of yeast in the bottle which affects the finish . it has flaws but it has a pleasent spiciness to it that makes it quite enjoyable the produced on date 5.277.75 what does that mean ? .'

S'sampled on tap at surly on darkness day , oct 23/2010 . pours deep red-brown with a hint of haze . when held to light flares of orange and ruby come through . a small dense dark tan head forms , dropping slowly with tons of thick lace . aroma is good . coffee . vanilla . dark and milk chocolate . caramel and a bit of toffee . multi-grain bread and biscuit . light alcohol . hint of smoke . taste is pretty similar to the aroma , but the coffee is more forward , with teh chocolate and vanilla more background players . medium-high bitterness level that builds even more along the way . vanilla and tobacco . mouthfeel is good . medium body . medium carbonation level . drinkability is so-so . the bitterness builds and by about the 6oz mark it was definitely overwhelmingly high . strangely , the alcohol feels a touch warm too . i think perhaps this is just a matter of trying to jam too many ideas into one beer . interesting though .'

S"this is one of the offerings from a rather new brewery out of tulalip , wa . from the bottle , this pours a hazy gold with a thick , sudsy head that recedes slowly . the bouquet is a mix of dough and apples , and the doughiness comes through in the flavor as well , emerging as a pronounced butteriness . the body is rounded out by a slight fruitiness -- again , apple . what 's lacking here is the crisp finish that i expect in a pilsener . the length of this brew is so consistent that it has the texture of an american blonde ale rather than a true pils . ultimately , this undermines the beer by taking away that quick hoppy finish which makes pilseners so ( in my mind ) refreshing . it 's rare that i want a beer to lose some length and body , but here , the length is actually a characteristic of czecko 's imbalance . eventually it just starts to taste a little slimey . a mixed result overall for this brew from aldergrove . with so many fine pilseners on the market these days , it 's hard to see why i would go back to this one ."

S"had the luck of running into this on tap at ashley 's in ann arbor . textbook imperial pour , jet with a tan head on top , good lacing , really hard to find any fault here . the nose is heavy on the chocolate with other subtle , sweet tones also present ... sugar , caramel . the flavour on this was a fairly standard take on the style . a malty profile with the chocolate and caramel tones from the nose coupled with the roasty backbone that makes the russian style what it is . not a lot of hops present . i like the direction that they were going with the flavour , but it is almost too well-balanced , it 's tasty , but nothing really jumps out at me either . the mouth on this was thick , coating , appropriate for the style . tremendous marks for the easy drinking nature of this though , no problem drinking a pint , i would say it is amongst the most drinkable of the big russian imperials that i 've had . the bottom line : this is n't a bad beer , but it is not as exceptional as stone 's other big beers . i would n't pass one up , but there are many others in the style that i enjoy more ."

S'yes , this is a very drinkable beer ... . but that is because it tastes like a watered down belgian wit ... . let me explain ... . the appearance is as it should be , with hat gold color and yeasty haze , and high carbonation ... nose seems just like a belgian wit ... . completely wrong for the style . even the label admits they use orange peel and coriander in it . all the smells and flavors in a saison should be coming from ester produced by the farmhouse yeast ... not from spices . if they did use a saison yeast strain , you would not even be able to tell due to the spices they added ... ( i just rolled my computer chair over a stinkbug while reviewing th ebeer and i can still smell the peppery belgian-wit-like nose from the beer ) ... flavor is mostly the same as the above , with a slightly closer to saison finish on the very back of the tongue ... but just barely ... . ah and drinkability ... i must admit i could drink a ton of these on a warm day ... . it is very refreshing.. as a saison is ... yet so is a belgian wit , which this beer should really be renamed as ... the label admits to the use of spices and the fact that it is only 4.7 % abv ... how can this be deemed a saison ?'

S'0,33l bottle . mindestines haltbar bis 03.08.11 . it pours a nice color , very light , clear , and pale pils with a sudsy bright white head that leaves all the lacing int he world . the smell is pretty interesting . it has some herbal , grassy notes but also some zesty fruit aromas like lemons , oranges , peaches , melon . the flavor is nice too . it has a grassy/herbal bite to it that leads into some tasty malts that perhaps have a bit of butteriness but not an overwhelming amount , the fruitiness can be tastes as well and a little bit of sweetness , the finish is a bit bitter with some herbal notes but also a faint bit of fruitiness . this is a hyped-up beer and is the first pils i have taken the time to sit down with here in germany to examine closely but it is a winner .'

S"thick , luscious , creamy , black-brown , with a reddish-brown and thick head that reduced down to a ring and nice dusting swirl . lovely ! amazing scents of darkness ! piney hoppiness , chocolate , red wine ... yummm ... surprisingly vineous taste in there . hearty red wine flavors , roasted malts , chocolate . dark coffee in the after taste . body is not as thick as it looks like it would be . flows easily and smoothly over your tongue . do n't get me wrong , there is a ton of flavor going on here ! this is great for sipping or relaxing , but maybe not as a session . very good stuff !"

S"a dark root beer color with a big tan head that settles and lots of clumpy lace . there is a sharp chocolate aroma with odd citrus hops overtones . it 's a very unusual smell that is not immediately recognizable or even obviously attractive . the taste is smooth and heavy with charcoal , chocolate , plenty of alcohol , a bit wine-like . i would n't call this highly drinkable but it has a real quality feel in its body . it 's a bit too heavy for my tastes but it is good . recommended to those who prefer some weight to their brews ."

S'poured this beer into my snifter . the beer was a pale yellow color with an unstable head that soon feel back into the glass . the beer was lightly carbonated and very few bubbles rose to the surface . the beer smelled mostly of adjunct corn with a little dms . the beer had little taste , no hop flavor at all , and was very watery . overall this was not a very good beer and i would not want to have another .'

S'from 12oz bottle a- pours a hazy/murky deep golden yellow with some orange highlights to it . nice 1 finger white head which died away pretty quick leaving no real lacing on the sides of the glass . s- musty bready smell off the bat . picking up some small hints of orange peel and clove . big belgian yeasty smell though . smells wonderful ! t- nice musty bready bite to this . very clean tasting . can detect a faint trace of the alcohol . clove and a strange banana-y taste along with this . m- light-medium mouthfeel to this . very crisp and clean tasting . carbonation is good for the style and really gives the beer a push across the palate . a great presence of yeast on the tounge after a sip . d- this is a very easy drinker and maybe one of the best american hefeweizens i have had the pleasure of drinking . would and will drink again . also would recommend to people who want something to bring them in easy to the style !'

S"after trying some other `` let 's see how strong we can make this '' brews ( sam adams triple bock for instance ) i was suprised to find that there was more to this brew . decent taste ! ! ! what a concept ! ! this beer tasted like coffee ice cream when first poured semi-cold . a very nice sweetness at first , with ice cream really coming to mind , masking the alcohol as well as one could expect at 23 % . at first it seemed there was no way this was 23 % , but when i let it warm a bit the alcohol was strong and the beer seemed more like a brandy . split a 12oz and that 's about all i could drink of this stuff , but compared to the sam adams ( about the only brew i 've had that is similar to this ) this brew was much more drinkable and enjoyable to drink . a novelty nonetheless , but a solid effort . drink this one cold ."

S"if only i could bottle up the fragrance of this beer and sell it as a perfume . when i first dipped my nose into the chalice , i exclaimed aloud , `` god damn ! '' this beer had quite large shoes to fill in the aroma dept . as well , as i had had a beef roast slowly cooking in the crockpot for the past 8 hours soaked in a chimay marinade filling my home with succulent aromas . the beer pours to a plum color , showing through in ruby/amber when held to the light . a perfect pillowy foam cap loiters atop the beautiful looking liquid for quite a long duration . i 've already mentioned how awesome the smell is . i will list specific aromas that i can pick out in the nose , but none of my description could do the bouqet of this beer any justice . it smells of plums and raisins , possibly even apples and berries . also lurking behind the fruity smells are the sweet smells of belgian candi sugar and malts . like i said , there 's no way my words could give justice to the aroma of this beer . the taste started off quite delicious , but after a while , it began to be quite sweet and tartish . has a bit of a cranberry , apple , raisin/plum , red wine sourness that can cause you to pucker up . the sweetness is also apparent up front , but quickly fades to sour and bitter . the hop bitterness in the finish is actually quite pleasently surprising . also had a huge oak taste in the finish , especially when warmed . the body seems to be kind of light , but the high alcohol content still remains fairly well hidden inside . not too highly drinkable because of the pucker factor as well as the high alcohol content , not to mention price . i 'll probably try the trippel as well , but i do n't think i will buy this again ( although the smell is quite tempting , i know of a few beers i like quite a bit better with just as awesome of a bouqet ) . worth a try ."

S"first of my blind bomber reviews . thank you so much neorunner ! appearance here comes the opening pitch , i suppose . i 'm at a loss for words . a pilsner or mug glass for this ? this was definitely off-speed , slow and steady . microfine collection of bubbles seal in the liquid beneath at least a finger of depth . they range in color from cream to rose in gentle flow . given time to rest , the necklace and thong panty bring some delight when gazing into . it reminds me of that change of inning where you peruse the spring-time sky . fun , but only in moderation . when it comes to the main body , it is too easy to describe . burgundy murk that is penetrated by light to reveal ... nothing . where the hell are my cascades of bubble ? or even a single bubble ? ahhh , it is just visible if i grab out a magnifying glass and peer from the top down . weaksauce . bouquet the secret of this beer is starting to come out . it slowly begins to focus ... a simple cursory inhale brings me apple cider . i know this characteristic aroma like the captain of the white sox . an explosion of smells come out of nowhere when this beer throws a high fast one by my head . i detect things like barley , strawberries , grape similar to concentrated juice , and faintly of potpourri laden vesicles long emptied . its good , but how often has a beer nailed this particular smell-set for me . you see a cocky pitcher throw his heater once , and you 've basically seen them all do it . flavor profile in anticipation for that third pitch , i ca n't help but feel like this beer has no more secrets . before i know it , its over the plate and in the pitcher 's mitt . my jaw drops ... i ca n't track it . this took my expectation of a barley wine and watered it down with come concord grape juice before it served it up . a second sip brings a change-up right through my box . i ca n't get a solid grasp on this son of a stitch . this time i think high alcohol content barley wine with grape tones . what kind of beer is this ? the opening is always a solid offering of apples and barley . these flavors break off into two categories . we have a low sliding option that slicks grape down my tongue and finishes with a mildly alcoholic reminder of what was once there . the second possibility is a variant on the first . a strong-fisted knuckle of ethanol stabs forth with tinges of pine and grape juice . this one finishes up unexpectedly , hopped up wine . oral sensations just as quickly"

S'bottle code 07a06 pours with a brilliantly clear , straw tinged , gold color that sits underneath a voluminous , easily three-finger thick , off white colored head that slowly falls back into the beer . the aroma is a mix of fruit , spicy thin hop notes and a dry grain-like character . the aromas remind me of pears , green apples , grassy herbs , and a touch of biscuit-like grain . despite the fruitiness this reminds me of the aroma of a amped up macro-lager , though it is certainly a bit more hoppy . the beer is quite dry , yet still has a soft fruitiness to it . it rests with a sort of mellow creaminess on the palate and finishes with a touch of light bitterness . the beer seems to quickly disappear in the finish with nary a remnant of the light flavors . this beer is quite light all around ; thin and watery , it is most notably sharp with its hop bitterness and carbonation . there is a grassy grain character here , which balances the bitterness but does not make this beer much more appealing . this beer certainly does not have any flaws , but it was clearly made for a beer drinker other than me . far to thin , with out even a refined malt and hop character . i find this beer uninteresting as it seems to serve as a replacement for a macro-lager . purchased : 58 degrees , tucson az'

S"year-old bottle . big boy tulip . all by myself . i had this on tap a few times , & it seems things have mellowed just a bit . a bit darker , like an old chardonnay . rocky , chiseled , off-white head . very spritzy . when fresh , it is better then a bouquet of almost anything your local florist can put together . so natural , with overpourings of lavender , rose , grass , & chamomile . never soapy or harsh , & just so seductive . with this aged bottle , there are certainly remnants of what once was , but the flowers have wilted more then somewhat , & been overlapped with fruit . a base of sweet tea is highlighted with scents of strawberry & pear . some very mild lavender does still remain though . slightly sharp & bittersweet , with just a hint of menthol & yeast . the sweet tea comparison is very inviting . taste-wise , you first have to get past the extreme carbonation . champagne-like bubbles . taste is chamomile & white grapes . a touch of caramelization has settled in . a clean leafy bitterness . it just barely hangs on to that dry saison finish . not the easiest quaffer , but only because i 'm encouraged to pay attention . never overbearing or intensely herbal , but softly fragrant & even juicy at times . easy alcohol , & an okay price tag if left for special occasions . awesome fresh , & still quite interesting when not . : )"

S"this pours a light golden orange with a modest , bright white head . a thin film sticks around until the end and leaves spots of lace . the aroma is ... unexpected . full of pumpkin pie spices . and pumpkin . and mashed ripe banana . and allspice . i 'll admit i picked this up because i enjoyed corne de brume from the same brewery , but i did n't know what style this was . and i 'm still not sure . but without even tasting it i 'm beyond positive it 's mis-listed here as an american ipa . no idea where that came from . the taste is similar , with an odd vegetable aspect too it washed away by a bright , clean floral bitterness all with a strong allspice aspect to it . is it allspice ? let me check my spice rack . yeah , it 's allspice all right . there 's a taste of straw and grains underneath . there 's a herbal earthy mineral quality that sticks around in the aftertaste . light bodied and lightly carbonated . certainly not an american ipa . and by no means a great beer . i 'd put this somewhere between an belgian pale ale and a pumpkin beer ... i guess . weird ."

S"pointless beer , essentially a lionshead but more subdued in every area . being that the regular lionshead is a fine cheap lager which is better than it 's expensive alternatives i would ( grudgingly ) recommend this to those who are trying to get light beer drinkers to look at more craft like beer . still , i think its pointless , life is too short to drink light beer . appearance-hazy golden , minimal head . smell-subdued tone of grains taste-watery but fresh , like any light beer , it does n't taste like crap which is a plus but that i suppose is because it is tasteless . mouthfeel- goes down smooth and light , like it is n't even there . drinkability-could definitely throw a few of these back on a hot day , but then again i could do that with a regular lionshead as well ."

S"poured from a 22oz . bomber into a tulip glass , the white christmas is orangish caramel colored , with an initially large , amber tinged tan head , that quickly recedes to a bit of surface skim leaving moderate lace . the aroma is spicy with a firm , sweet malt backbone . as predominately mentioned on the label , there 's dried orange peel , mace , cinnamon , coriander , and white pepper . the taste follows the aroma , heavy on the coriander and pepper , with a rich maltiness . there is also a slight smokiness to it . the finish is quick and clean , as is often the case with beers using more spice then hops , aside from a bit of pepper lingering at the back of the throat . the mouthfeel is creamy with a moderate , malty body . the drinkablity was only moderate , as while i was initally really loving this , after a while the spices got to be a bit much . i think their spice choices were good , but could use a new formula , maybe more citrus and less astringent ? the bottom line , as you might have noticed from my descriptions of this beer , is that this a lot more like a belgian saison then a belgian wit , aside from the extra body and higher attenuation . in fact , it reminds me alot of dupont 's new years offering , avec les bons voeux , so much so that i assume it was their intention to clone it . which is a great thing , because i absolutely love that beer . however , i 'm not sure they got the spice ratio quite right , and i do n't know how much , if any of the spice came from whatever yeast they used . so while it falls short , it is a valiant effort and still pretty good . and of course much cheaper then the dupont , although not a strong abv wise . scoring note , i am judging this as a saison , not a wit . either way , it 's under attenuated ."

S'without doubt the tastiest beer i have ever sampled . nothing else i have ever had tastes quite like it , so bear with me as i try to put this touching experience into words . 1975 vintage , 180 ml bottle that has spent the last 34 years in the cellar of a beer collector in england . acquired privately at an amazingly cheap price . pours a thick , syrupy , opaque black with a finger of tan head . a finger of head ! the carbonation here is remarkable given the age . smells ... so unique . fruity , woody , funky , meaty ... a hint of roastiness . will this taste anything like a stout ? yes ! sweetness envelops my tongue as i take a modest sip , followed by a slightly roasty astringency , and a sharp bitterness lingers long after i swallow . the stout backbone is very apparent from beginning to end , but the flavours have evolved dramatically . honey , fig ... a faint saltiness ... soy , meat , tobacco -- but these are really well-integrated into the whole ... woody sherry-like notes , lightly oxidized . absolutely heavenly : words fail me . the mouthfeel is luxuriously full , syrupy , and with a creamy carbonation that is astounding after all these years . i am floored . this beer is simply overwhelming . the drinkability is only hurt by the fact that i could only ever have one in one sitting .'

S'amazing taste , and brewed with a honey , that gives it an extremely smooth , albeight sweet taste . very similar to chimay reserve . with 9 percent alcohol , this one will sneak up on you fast ! excellent example of a belgian trippel from someone who hasnt done it before .'

S"i found this 22oz brown bottle at the binny 's store in plainfield , il for $ 5.49 . 5 spices listed on the label , so i was anticipating a spicy , flavorful beer . the beer poured a clear golden color and made a nice 1 finger white head that lasted a few minutes and left some good lacing . as for the smell - what smell ? this is the weakest smelling spiced beer i ever put my nose into . if you breath in heavy and swirl it around a bit , you might find a hint of malt and some white pepper , but that 's it . the taste is a bland as the smell . nothing offensive , but not the spicy christmas beer i was hoping for . it 's ok for a lager but disappointing as a spiced beer . the body is light to medium with moderate carbonation . easy to drink but so is water . this beer needs more flavor !"

S"on tap @ pour judgement . $ 6/pint . a- really pale pour , not what i remember , pretty good head though . lacing is spotty . s- nice piny hops with a twinge of onion which again i do not remember . i thought this one was much more floral when i had it before . t- nice pine bitterness , but there 's a bit of the gubna in this one . this beer is not how i remember it , dirty lines ? old keg ? better in the bottle ? onion/garlic and a rough , harsh bitterness . hop profile seems to hav shifted away from the tropical fruit notes i enjoyed in the bottle . m- pretty potent lingering hops , moderate body . d- low . i did not care for this one on tap . i did not finish this beer , which is very rare . i will have to try this again in bottles to see if my plate has shifted drastically or if this was just a fluke . as it stands , i 'd suggest getting bottles of this and checking the freshness date ."

S'22 oz bomber poured into chalice , no date but it was released in early january . appearance : deep dark charcoal like black with a dark cream colored head that is very thin . smell : smells of sweet oats and breadiness . subtle aromas of vanilla and mystery dried fruit . taste : ver rich and creamy upfront with a strong roasted malt flavor of oats , maple . then quickly fades to a strong bitter hop bite , linger flavor of pickled cornichons . mouthfeel : very full-bodied and creamy , a meal in a glass . carbonation is medium , though i would say somewhat high for a ris overall : a very tasty and complex ris , the head brewer at smuttynose recommends letting this one sit for about 6 months which i did and i would say it could go even longer to let the hop bite mellow out a bit more . still a very tasty ris , well done smutty'

S"12 ounce bottle into sam adams perfect pint . i want to do this review more justice , but the beer had a nice orange to golden hue with good effervescence and a dense egg shell white head . from there you will find basically a direct clone of flying dog 's raging bitch , minus the little bit of extra belgian yeast flair that makes that beer extremely kick ass . i was impressed that sam adams was able to get as much belgian yeast character into this beer , as i have generally found that to be something they do n't succeed with very well . nothing bad about this , good fruit and spice tones , nothing off in terms of fermentation or style approach . simply overall found it to be derivative of raging bitch , as i said minus that flair that flying dog gets into their belgian ipa ."

S"had this on-tap at the comet at hopnosis . pour is from the tap to a pint glass . this could easily be my favorite offering from founders yet . review is from notes taken on 12/3/09 . appearance : pours a well-balanced coffee brown with light hints of toffee brown to ruby red ; no head to speak of , just a very thin whisp of a skim in the center of the surface ; body is mostly opaque so i ca n't see if it 's well carbonated or not ; no lacing to speak of . smell : definite presence of sweet maple syrup ; strong whiff of alcohol that is bourbonesque ; slight oaky/vanilla scents ; nose is quite strong and inviting - almost making me hungry for pancakes just smelling it : ) taste : i 'm overwhelmed ... wonderful flavors of maple syrup , caramel and burnt sugary malts ; elements of bourbonesque alcohol ; slight hints of chocolate ... flat out amazing . presence of alcohol really begins to grow as it warms , but it 's still very well blended with all of those other sweet flavors . mouthfeel : body is a tad flat , but being barrel-aged it 's not that uncommon ; body is a little slick as well , but definitely leaves the mouth sticky ; belly is left quite warm and full from this offering . drinkability : absolutely fantastic flavors and smells , sits a bit heavy though and the abv is too high for too much , and also i would imagine that the super sweet flavors would start to turn a stomach after a while , but i 'm fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to try it and would gladly have another pint at some point if the opportunity presents itself ."

S"2009 release , bottled last week , bought from a cold box in chico . needless to say i have high expectations about the freshness of this beer ! makes a great appearance on stage ; rich , lively carmel colored ale and a big glorious green head with lace to spare . the green fades to cream and collapses after about 5 minutes and it coats the glass with carmel colored sticky webs . without a doubt lots of hops were used to make this beer . fresh hops aroma , along with signature sn maltiness . besides lots of chinook-like aroma there is fruitcake , oak sawdust , and general beerness . aroma is milder than i expected . on to the taste . punishing bitterness and strong carmel malt is the main idea . all that nice hop aroma is vastly overtaken by the big malts . surely a blow to the palate with hops , but not something you 'd want to experience too much of . i do n't think it all works together 100 % , but my generous 4.0 goes partially to the fact that it 's so damn hoppy , and i have a soft spot for really hoppy beers of all types . a bit undercarbonated letting the heavy carmel malts and unfermented sugars bogart the mouthfeel . it 's rich and chewy with a heavy body , almost like a mini-barleywine . sticky and dense too . it looses it 's carbonation and it 's hop aroma relatively quickly . this is a big beer , very filling and a bit dehydrating . it 's got very good hop qualities but the huge malt body is a bit too bit to call it refreshing . one 24oz bottle and i am freaking full ! a good experience for sure , but one is enough for me . cheers !"

S"it 's hard to review a rogue beer . when was it brewed ? why is it so expensive ? so yeah ... it 's rogue , i 'm sure this is a 5 dollar beer sold for 9 . i 'll just have to see how it works out . golden orange colored body . big pillowy cream head . a lot of bubbles shooting up from the middle , very tiny . bourbon barrels aroma just dominates the nose . mixed in are some citrus hops that barely are able to separate themselves . also a bit of caramel malt as well . this beer lacks the flavor the nose hints at . opens with almost not flavor , and has it moves back you start to pick up a strong malty caramel finish . there 's a touch of hops in the finish and not much else to speak of . the barrel aging has mellowed this beer but not imparted much flavor . perhaps a bit of vanilla from the barrels . the 40 ibu 's i feel are greatly a result of oak aging ruining an ok beer . the end result though is n't bad . it 's a tasty malt head 's ideal use of oak i 'd say . kicks with way too much alcohol , heavy bodied , and rather creamy . a step down from dead guy to say the least . this bottle will be all i want and then some . maybe make a 4 pack of this in 12 oz bottles ? i mean if you like it 12 oz is more than enough . if you do n't like it you wo n't even consider them . oh wait ... this is rogue . they 're fine with their beers just sitting on shelves for months/years ."

S"the drinkability is certainly there considering the low abv and lightness of this apa . the beer pours a very , very clear amber color with some head , retention , minimal lacing . the beer is pretty well carbonated and the effervescent carbonation is apparent throughout . the smell is not overly distinct , some bready malts , some nutty flavors , some sweetish malts of the caramel variety , not much indication of the sharpness to come . the taste has a bit of lemony tang on the front end , it segues into more maltishness in the middle , and finishes with a crispness and hoppy bite that does not balance all that well overall . this beer is somewhat complex , there are some bready flavors , some tinges of nuttiness , and plenty of dryness . there is very little in the way of sweet malts , or sweet anything for that matter , but there is n't much ripe hop either . the beer is reasonbly recommended if you are itching for a dry , fairly carbonated , lightish , bready malt beer apa . it 's good , but it is certainly not my favorite apa ."

S'a gentle pour results in a wispy skim across the surface , that looks like a smudge of cirrus clouds . some spotty bits of lace randomly dot the sides of the glass . decent retention . the body is a lighter shade of brown , that glints ruby in the sunlight . clarity is ok , you can see the underside of the surface bubbles through the glass . savory aroma of black cherry , red wine grapes , minerals , leather , and balsamic vinegar . really nice , and i find myself inhaling deeply before every sip . tannic and fruity , notes of apple butter , cherry skins , tart grapes , with a lingering taste of oak and vague maltiness . tart and acetic , though rather mellow and well integrated . definitely more mellow than the grand cru , and more savory . full and rich despite the lower levels of carbonation . i could easily put away a 750 of this with ease ... one to be savored .'

S"this has a nice clear yellow-orange look , with a tight off white head . really nice nose with big hops , piny , orange zest , a bit of malt there , not much . i compare this to other dipa 's and it does n't stand up to maharaga , one of my favorites , of cource the abv is much lower , the mouthfeel not as heavy , i do want more from this style although it is well balanced , just not as complex or deep as others . because of the lower abv it 's more easier to drink this , more of a nice drinker for hot days , not a sipper but an easy bomber to go down . not my favorite but nicely done ."

S"appearance - hazy caramel amber body is darker than most lagers , let alone pale lagers . small amount of visible carbonation . lots of sediment/floaters dispersed equally throughout . short white head with low retention . smell - sweet , light and nutty . honey . smells quite a bit like a blush wine . leave it to the french to make a beer like that ... taste - dry as hell . has a bit of sourness to it . tastes a whole lot like a gueuze . i almost suspect this has been mislabeled as a euro pale lager . noticeable alcohol . tastes like an 8 % abv , even though it 's only 6 % . mouthfeel - light and a bit astringent . overall drinkability - this might be interesting and go well paired with food , due to the uncharacteristically potent dryness . as a session beer , i think it falls a bit flat . it 's not an easy beer to drink . this beer was probably designed for people who 'd rather be drinking wine . i 'd rate it within style , but the beer itself is n't even within the style . so the rating here is pretty much just personal opinion ."

S"consumed at lax radisson beer dinner , 07/16/08 . pours a ruddy red/brown . cloudy . no real carbonation to speak of . the aroma is all cherry all the time . real cherries , not the flavored syrup kind . aroma is a bit sour as well , making me fear a gueze/lambic flavor ... the flavor is thankfully more tart than sour . very cherry , with more cherry note sin the mid taste and a cherry finish . there 's a bit of maltiness in there ... oh , wait , there 's more cherry . definitely an after-dinner dessert beer . your tolerance will depend on how much you like cherries . i do n't think i could do a whole bottle of this one ; it 's a sharer ."

S"pours a fairly transparent golden orange with bright white head . smell is mediocre . nothing incredible going on here . taste is also quite bland . a bit of malty sweetness but none of the spciness i would expect from a hefeweizen . in fact the sweetness is way out of balance , and this tastes very little like a hefe . on the upside , the carbonation is good and this one is highly drinkable . overall : do n't bother unless you 're handed one ."

S"pours a slightly hazed bright golden yellow colour , with a thick and foamy head of pure white foam . head is excellent , and although it does n't retain particularly well , the lacing is good as well . overall , it really is an excellent looking pils ; clean , sharp , and boisterous . pleasant sharp hops on the nose , resinous with citrus and crushed vegetation . very clean and crisp - a slight hint of yeast to add a little depth . not particularly strong or astringent on the nose , but there are lots of extremely pleasant characters . sharp hops on the palate , which is otherwise extremely clean and clear . the vector of bitterness spears through the centre , leaving a resinous sharpness on the otherwise clear an mild palate . some residual sweetness on the back , but mostly this is a crisp , sharp and very drinkable pilsener . while it does n't have the amazing hop character or intensive fragrant bitterness of the best pilseners i 've had ( for example victory prima pils ) , this is really an excellent example of the style . murray 's like to say they do n't brew to style , but as far as i 'm concerned , this is exactly what you want from a pils . it 's crisp , sharp , clean and astonishingly drinkable . a really excellent beer . another wonderful brew from murray 's ."

S"2004 vintage no . p82552 saw this at the local liquor store and decided to give it a try . bottle is 8.5 oz . pours a dark ruby with no head . aroma is a strong sweet malt with a noticable bite of alcohol.taste is very thick , sweet and malty with not much carbonation . alcohol is definately present in the taste but not overpowering . this is a unique beer that i can not compare to any other i have tasted up to this point . the drawbacks of this beer is lack of carbonation ( mouthfeel suffers because of this ) and it 's almost overpowering sweetness . i definately could have been aged for a bit longer , but overall a good after dinner beer . i will defiantely purchase this again with the intent of aging it for a few years ."

S"i had this a recent family get together . not my first choice for beer by any means , but it was free ... . poured , well like a macro . transparent yellow with a white that disappears quickly . carbonation was moderate , but boy did it ever disappear after awhile ... . the smell was nothing much : very little malt , and maybe a kiss of hops . the most dominant thing , however , were the grains . reminded me of field corn fresh off the fields in late fall . just as with the smell , there was nothing much there with the taste . thin , light bodied and tasting of light corn adjuncts and faint malt with an oh so slight hop finish . i 'll probably never return to this stuff except maybe at family gatherings , reunions and such . about all that 's going for it is that it is easy to down ."

S"bottle 881 from 2003 , sampled march 2007 pours a blackish , dark , chocolate brown color with a fat-one-finger thick brownish tan colored head . the aroma smells of coffee and smoky phenolic notes as i pour this brew into my glass . upon deeper inspection the aroma takes on a rich , almost dusty , chocolate note and a dark , sweet maltiness that in combination evoke thoughts of chocolate malt ball candies . clearly some of these aromatic notes are derived from the age of this brew ; also notes of rum , port and perhaps even a touch of the sweeter character from tamari are noticeable . the taste is quite dry , with a sour edge to it that makes me think of lactic acid . this acidity could just be residual notes left from the roasted-type malts used in this brew , but i am not too sure . up front this beer has a soft , palate coating maltiness , though it ultimately yields to a lightness in the finish that is derived from the acidity in the finish . i actually do n't think that the acidity is from any sort of infection , i think it mostly has to do with how this beer has aged , and the fact that my palate might be particularly sensitive to it right now . there are not funky notes here that might be indicative of something wayward . dry , chalky , cocoa powder notes ; touches of burnt plums ; flavors reminiscent of coffee that has been left a touch too long on the hot plate all of these flavors and more that i ca n't quite pull out make up the flavor of this brew . the aroma is actually quite intriguing , yet the flavor does not live up to that initial promise . still this is an interesting beer to sample , and i definitely would still buy a bottle of this to try in hindsight ."

S"first off , why does beer advocate have the shmaltz brewing co listed in california ? the label on the 22-ounce bottle i just drank puts shmaltz in saratoga springs , ny ( though why they 'd be there instead of coney island is another freaky fact ) . anyway , the label is a fun addition to my beer label collection , and i 've enjoyed other shmaltz brews , so i had to try this `` steel hop lager . '' i bought this photogenic bomber ( `` arouse ! your liquid curiosities amaze ! your oral sensibilities indulge ! your inner beer freak '' ) from the big bottle craft brew rack at the ithaca coffee co 's gateway commons shop , 311 green st , while much enjoying a thursday afternoon ithaca beer co cask tasting of their flower power ipa , july 15 , 2010 . it sat in my fridge `` alive '' freaky sword stunting for a week , waiting for a home-made pizza to get baked to eat with it . my first disappointment hit right away , as opening the bottle cap caused no pssst at all . i wondered if the bottle had not sealed ? pouring into a pint glass gave me a brief thin head , though , so i guess it was capped ok. a very cloudy honey amber color , with thin persistent lacy film of just barely there froth still had me worried something was off with this beer . smell revealed 3 of the 4 great beer odors : good piney hops , sweet malt , ethanol . no yeast smell at all , though . taste , like the smell , had a real nice complex balance of malt and hops . still no yeast , however , leaving a hollow space in my mouth where that part of beer should be . mouthfeel thin and just barely carbonated . no way not to notice this lager is almost flat . i would n't want to drink another sword swallower if this is really the way it 's supposed to taste . wish they 'd put a best before or brew date on this bottle so i could have some idea if this one was stale or made this way on purpose . a dot-matrix batch code stamped on bottle bottom gave `` 4121005080758 '' as some sort of inventory control number ; shmaltz would do better to give us the brewing date if such brews go bad before we can drink them ."

S"appearance - 4.0 poured a finger of foamy pink head that steadily reduced . colour is a deep , barely transparent red . smell - 3.5 the first smell is a musty cork aroma ( please do n't be tainted ! ) that may actually be the oak barrels that the beer is brewed in . some fresh cherry ( particularly skin ) , slightly herbal . taste - 3.5 wow , this tastes like sour warheads ! i was told of the mouth-puckering sourness before , but this has just blown me away . wow ! there is a distinct damp woody flavour , muted cherry flavour , a little vinegar and the sweetness overpowered by the sourness . nice aftertaste . mouthfeel - 3.0 puckering sourness dicatates here , a low level of fine carbonation . moderately weighted , leaves the mouth feeling a little sticky . drinkability - 2.5 low . true to the style , somewhat refreshing , but i think most would struggle with this , as i did . overall - 3.65 perhaps this is a good example of a traditionally brewed lambic , but it is just too much for me . very expensive also , but it was worth the try . shoot me for saying it , but i think i prefer belle vue kriek !"

S'old style is one of the beers i love to pick up when i head home to the up . it is not easy to find in west michigan but a mainstay in northern wisconsin . old style is a light gold color that has a slight pale hint to it . the smell is sweet and sugary . this lager is sweet . it is similar in construction to a good martini . the gin is the malt i.e . the dominate flavor . the hopsis the vermouth , and in a good dry martini there is very little vermouth . this beer has very little hops . due to the high malty flavor , old style feels good when it is quaffed . this is a beer that goes well with the one day of summer in the up . all in all , this is a good american lager .'

S'i had a few of these pours at the brewpub and they were really pleasant exercises . the pour rocked a deep and rich brown with a decent head that jizzed off lacing to a decent extent . the nose was light and wafty and filled with brown sugar and cream and just the requisite amount of bog funk . rich and boastful . very appealing . the taste was slick and tasty with plenty of brown sugar and caramel to go around as well as the smoky peat ambiance that defines the style . the mouthfeel remained light and refreshing even under the hefty tones that proliferated . this beer has a creamy finish that would make bob proud . the drinkability was superb . this beer is an example of a highly drinkable beer that deserves respect . i believe the abv was advertised at greater than 8 % , however it was just a pleasure to consume . i was not disappointed . my first trip to jamesport was nothing less than a memorable and enjoyable one . the fact that this brew pub does not distribute bottled packages makes me feel lucky to be able to partake as the product is very respectable . i am a fan . if ever , oh ever you should happen through lovely ludington be sure and treat yourself .'

S'tasted by a half-pint at the devenshire cat , sheffield . served by a handpump fitted with a sparkler . a : golden hue , creamy white beer head with superb retention ; carbonation is stable . s : citric theme of hops ( goldings-like ) with a lightly floral touch ( perle hops ? ) , along with a quite refreshing edge of hop resins and a thin flow of juicy malts . overall the aroma features the intense and lively citrus-ness with very little intervention of malts . t : a profound depth of unripe tangerine-like citric flavour and camomile-like flowery bouquet both prevail on the palate , laden with a very light but substantive maltiness at the back a straw-ish , tannic , mildly zesty bitterness creeps down the palate , expanding towards all corners of the mouth ; also lingering in the finish is the great length of aromatic and chewy maltiness . m & d : smoothly-carbonated on the palate , well-structured in the flavour profile , a complex but clear hop theme with a great depth . a supremely quaffable golden bitter that improves on the palate sip by sip !'

S"well i had to go and buy a second twelver of these fine mediocre beers . i mean it aint that bad . really i mean it tastes like beer ya know so what could be worse it aint no ice beer or a lambic or a belgium . it is some single row malt with some sugar and a dusting of low alpha hops . but i do n't mind drinking it so i give it an overall c to c- but for 11.99 a halfrack and with the sweet champagne bottles i felt it wer n't too bad after all . so i got 's me another twelve this fine halloween mornin ' . i kinda like this for a work beer when i sit back and paint i likes to sip on a brew and you know this one is a brew so therefor it must be kinda okay ... smells like beer , tastes like beer , it must be beer ... ."

S"pours a dark black with ruby hues when held to light . there is a nice thick finger and a half head that is a creamy tan color . good lacing is present after the head goes down . smell is very pleasant . there is a strong carmel and chocolate presence . there is also some coffee present as well . taste is just like the smell . there is some sweet carmel as well as a little chocolate with some roasted bitterness as well . the taste is good but not as strong as the smell was but is pretty good . mouthfeel is a little more thin than i would prefer . i enjoy this beer . maybe not as much as other porters but i am impressed by ab 's effort . their second solid effort out of the sampler that i have had to go along with the bavarian wheat . i would buy this regularly if available because i am sure it would be available everywhere here in st. louis ."

S'most recent vintage released just this week . nice rusty pour with some big league bubbles into my great taste of the midwest tasting glass muted sourness , canned crushed cherries , and a touch of soapiness tartness and sourness are muzzled here . the cherry presence reminds me more of cherry pie filling than of fresh cherry . there is a cleanness in both the mouthfeel and finish of this beer that leaves me wanting more . while quite enjoyable , i expected a slightly more bruising sour experience . oh , what could have been with this beer . a local sour would be a real treat . having said that , this beer drinks so smoothly and easily . that , coupled with the lack of crushing experience , make this a breeze to drink .'

S"12 oz into a pilsner glass . pale , clear , white-headed beer . the nose hit me right out of the bottle . american adjunct for sure . very light and not as clean as i 'd like . there is a faint grass smell there but not much else . taste is clean and just a bit sweet , but grainy-sweet not sugar-sweet . a light tang accompanies . it is refreshingly clean and free of aftertaste . mouthfeel is slightly fuller than what i usually experience in an aal but not so much to be a medium-bodied beer . carbonation is pretty standard and the finish is slightly dry . even as the beer warms slightly the aftertaste does not get out of hand and the overall light-grain , tangy-goodness remains . this is pitcher beer and i would love to try it on draught . quite quaffable . a very drinkable aal . slainte ."

S'wow , fantastic beer . reminds me of why i got into the hobby . this tastes what i remember my first sierra nevada pa tasting like after the sea of pabst and ice beers my underage buddies would always drink at their parties . now a grown man and an experienced beer enthusiast , something that hits me as something special is few and far between , but this definately does it for me . nothing really special , malty enough , hoppy enough , light enough , just enough . and i think thats why i like it so much . i can not honestly say why it deserves the 4.4 or whatever my average will be , other than to say it is just perfect . nothing extreme , not too malty , not too hoppy , no smoke flavor , no pepper taste . as a dedicated rogue fan , im almost tired of these gimmicks . ( but not quite : p ) i may have a new all time favortie beer , a bread and butter beer that meets you right in the middle . first alameda brew iv had , if the rest are this good , i may have to be replacing my rogue bumper stickers . ( i love portland ) after a second and third tasting of this brew , i must say im a bit let down . the first bottle was incredible but 2 that followed a few weeks later tasted mostly like fat tire , a bit immature and tasting like brewers yeast . not sure what went wrong here , perhaps a bad brew or something , il have to get another bottle to try again in a few months . oh well , il always have the memories of that one perfect bottle ... .'

S"bought this one because i enjoy a good cider . not expecting much , but it was cheap anyway . let 's give it a shot . 12oz bottle into sam adams perfect pint . pours a slightly red-tinged golden color with a finger of head that immediately disappears . huge , visible carbonation . the aroma actually works . smells like apple pie . not sure how i feel about drinking twelve ounces of it , but it smells good . you know what ? this actually is n't bad at all . strong cinnamon at first , which gives way to a solid apple taste , and finishes on a sweet candy apple note . nice cleanliness on the finish . again , i 'm still not so sure on a huge glass , but it does n't taste bad . the mouthfeel is nice and light , with a bit of drying on the end . the drinkability does suffer here though , as expected . the first 4.5 % alcohol brew that i 'd ever call a sipper . i 'd take a four or six ounce serving with gusto , but 12 ounces , or ( god forbid ) a whole pint is just too much . overall , this is a lot better than i expected though . the concept actually works . do n't expect many `` beery '' flavors though , but it 's surely a lot more complex and enjoyable than a smirnoff ice apple twist or what have you . taken on it 's own merits , it 's a pretty good beer ."

S"thanks to my buddy bill for this bottle . poured from a 2007 vintage 12oz . bottle into a nyc craft beer week 8oz . glass . a : hazy , orange-ish color with a good amount of tight bubble carbonation that fizzes - impressive for a beer 3 years old . s : sweet 'n ' sticky maple syrup , yeast , caramel malts . t : bitter , caramel , bitter , toffee , bitter , raisins and such . a well-rounded flavor profile at this point . m : great carbonation for this style and age . leads me to believe this could have held up another couple of years , albeit it is a little watery right now . d : the best feature of this beer . it 's very hard to tell that this beer is 11.5 % . the bitterness is a little cloying but if you let it sit in your mouth you experience the richness of this beer . overall , i did n't think this one was sour or infected as others noted with this vintage ."

S'copper hue with a slight haze . stiff , stabile , one fingered rocky ivory white head leaves dense , muddled lace . the aroma is comprised of soft floral hops with an undertone of doughy , underbaked biscuit . trace lemony , citric twang . tame , but clean aromawise . in flavor , prevalent in malt character is simple , gentle , lightly bready pale malt . hints of medium lovibond crystal add a subtle toffee note . sturdy , firm hop bitterness overruns malt sweetness lending a parching dryness . stately herbal hop flavor . virtually devoid of yeast derived character , save a paltry fruity tartness that arises late . lightly bodied , with a spritzy , but passably dextrinous mouthfeel . finishes with quickly fading hints of dry , bland cracker with an herbaceous twang . well crafted and thirst quenching , but not terribly satisfying nor exciting . akin to an overhopped kolsch in overall character .'

S"thanks to joey for sharing this one at la bella last night , seems like i was the only one that did n't quite enjoy it . poured a honey color with about a quarter inch of foam , decent retention and mostly large bubbles made up the head . the aroma was of yeast esters , apple , hints of strawberry , belgian candy sugar , pilsner malt sweetness , and hints of banana . oh , no ! with the first sip comes this horrible metallic flavor that lasted till the last sip . after the initial metallic flavor i tried to concentrate and find other flavors and was able to pick up some banana , spices , yeast , apple , and flowers in the finish . however , every sip had a distracting rusty nail flavor , like sucking on a penny . at first the malt sweetness tried to assert itself on the palate but the metallic finish killed it . not that complex either . the mouthfeel was also distracting , very fizzy and effervescent and not in a creamy/soft texture , it was quite aggressive at first and hard to drink . i kept stirring my glass to get out some of the carbonation and it got a little better . i had trouble finishing my last 2 ounces or so . the alcohol was very well hidden though ."

S"whoa ! i do n't know what i 'm reviewing here . pours a decent amber but a very , very disappointing head that melts to tiny lacing on the ring of the glass within seconds . aroma is initially begium malt/yeast although a little weak for the style . taste is a total shocker for me . initally a mildly sweet malt that gets overpowered and disappears completely to a very sour lemony bitterness upon swallowing . not a hop citrus ... merely a lemony bitterness without a hint of sugar . aftertaste is both lemon peel and something metalic . the mouthfeel lacks all of the fine carbonation richness that should be present in a conditioned beer of this sort i wish i could say that this was merely a bad bottle but in truth , the flavors seem intentional and as such just do not belong in this style let alone beer at all . sorry angel city ... .abbey it 's not ... belgium it 's not ... beer ? only by ingredients ."

S"from a brewmasters collection mixed six pack . 12 ounce bottle poured into a sam adams perfect pint glass . beer pours a deep red with a barely noticeable , thin white head that receded to some slight lacing . aroma is sweet and malty . nothing to write home about it . taste is buttery and sweet , very malty . the carbonation seems inefficient and the mouthfeel on the whole is a little thin . drinkability is pretty good though . you can definitely drink a few of these in a sitting . i 've paired sam irish red with corned beef and cabbage before and its a good pairing for an irish dinner . as others have said , there are n't a lot of irish reds on the market and sam 's offering while not a world class beer is a pretty good representation of the style and a lot better option than many of the mass produced irish beers on the market today ."

S"the ipa was a pleasant surprise to kickoff my visit to the russian river brewery . my only real criticism of this beer is that it is a bit similar to other russian river entries . it does n't beat out their two current freshly hopped beers , but then blind pig and pliny the elder are two of my favorite beers , so that 's no big deal . it 's a flavorful ipa with a lot of citrus and pine hop notes . the beer pours a handsome light amber with a big white head . the smell is a bit weaker than i 'd like but it 's well-balanced with pine and flowers hops pairing with clearer malt than some big ipa 's . the taste is more hops than malt . certainly in line with russian river 's style . there 's more citrus than bp and pliny , and it packs quite a punch even with those beers as my main point of comparison . sorry to keep referring to those beers but i 've had quite a few bottles of them this year , and they were my only experience with russian river and my motivation for visiting . the mouthfeel is fairly superb for me . i like a strongly bitter aftertaste on an ipa . it calms the sweetly floral nature of the hops . while it 's still a quite drinkable beer , i did knock it a bit for this bitterness . it 's enjoyable but after a few of them i can imagine my mouth begging for mercy ."

S"well , this is a style i certainly have avoided like the plague for a long time . my hunch was that it would be a rather bland , unexciting genre hardly befitting my need for a complex , tasty , and taste-fulfilling concoction . but , in the spirit of adventure , i was willing to go the extra mile and sample this version of the blonde ale style . admittedly , it took a free sample bottle from a local representative to get me to that point , but , oh well ! it pours a straw yellow with amber-ish background , with a fizzy , white head that came and went very quickly . the aroma is mainly of grain and light malts , with a citrus overtone . wow , this one sure is highly carbonation : one swallow and i felt my belly poof up like a balloon ! it 's lean bodied , and the mild flavor is mostly malt and sweet citrus . a mild hop character comes forward at the finish , but it , too , is lightly noticed . definitely related to kolsch , but without the complexity . easy to drink , that 's for sure . this is a style i do n't find myself getting interested in , but i 'm sure its `` drinkability '' will garner many fans ."

( i had a gift card to use people ) ... i asked for this to be served without the damn lemon ... . the beer poured nicely , created a 1 finger white foamy head . the color was a light yellow and it was cloudy , hence the unfiltered style . the smell was only average , it was very yeasty- i did not pick up much citrus or hop aroma . the mouthfeel was average , slightly watered down . the taste was average . this is a great `` starter beer '' for trying to get someone out of the american light lager box . 7 years ago , i would have loved this . the taste is not bad , just not much going on- very yeasty , slight wheat taste , no hop or fruit notes to speak of . this is a good beer- i think it would be great for a hot summer day ."

S"notes from 5/3/10 . bottle from zoso1967 ( thank you ! ) shared with tchopcraver ( thank you ! ) pours a strawberry copper red with a one finger head that lingers throughout the brew . lacing sticks to the glass and forms objects that look like white mountains . i have to say the head and lacing of this is second to none ... very impressive . the smell of cherries dominates the scent . i 'm also getting a bit of strawberry , spicy clove , and alcohol esters . the overall scent character is much like a dessert wine . wow , this is much more sour than anticipated . i was expecting a wine quality and it is anything but . this has a similar quality to a tear jerker gum ball . the taste of cherry starts the flavor and quickly morphs into a sour explosion that changes character and lasts for 12 seconds . the taste of this beer lasts forever , it is wonderful . this is relatively light in mouthfeel but really gets the saliva going . the strange part is my mouth is really dry and clean afterword . this beer eats my saliva . overall , this is a very drinkable ale . strangely , i think it would be really good mixed with iced tea like an arnold palmer ... though that would be disrespectful to supplication . the complexity keeps me coming back for more , this is a treat ."

S"well , it 's better than corona , but that 's not hard . reviews on this one seem to bounce around more than usual , which is interesting . here 's my take : appearance : clear amber color . light lace , fades more quickly than i 'd like . smell : light , malty , not much else . taste : bland , tasteless , mildly astringent aftertaste . i really expected more . mouthfeel : probably the best quality of this one . thick , almost creamy feel , even without any real taste . drinkability : not the worst beer i 've ever had , but overall rather bland and uninteresting . drink it if you 're handed one , but i can think of a lot of things i 'd rather be drinking ."

S'a - poured into a glass , beautiful clear milk chocolate brown color that i can see straight through but almost no head . a pretty head would have made this a perfect 5 s - booozy , chocolate , lots of malty sweetness t - roasty and chocolaty with a tiny taste of mellowed out hops . overall , this beer is definitely helped by the barrel aging . m - very rich , but not at all thick . the perfect combination . d - i could session this with no difficulty'

S"poured a light orange color with a thin foamy white head on it . i could nto pick up any pumpkin aroma here , just the nutmeg , cinnamon and other fall like spices . still pleaseant though . the taste is sweet and spicey but does n't have much else . the mouthfeel is kinda watery and light . for the same price i would probably go with post road pumpkin by brooklyn brewery . this is n't a disaster though as it is pretty drinkable , it just is n't very deep . its a spiced beer . for the price you might as well go for a real microbrewed pumpkin ale because all this is is fall and christmas-like spices mixed with a ho hum ale ."

S"i will defend this beer to death for its price . i understand its horrid reviews in the german pilsener category but my love for it is as on the surface as can be . it 's an $ 11 case of beer that does not offend in any way . in a world of natty , beasts , and lionheads ... old german holds my heart for the cheapest/easiest to down beer . obviously there are no overwhelmingly impressive characteristics about any of the five beer senses [ a , s , t , mf , or d ] . do not buy this beer because its a quality german pilsener . i do buy this beer because i want to drink heavily or for its simple lawnmower qualities ."

S'this lager was in a gift pack , brought to me from the uk , which had 5 european lagers . it pours golden colour topped by a thin , white head . the head settled quite fast . mouthfeel is quite smooth and the flavor consists of malts and hints of hops . quite drinkable lager .'

S'this long anticipated beauty poured as black as black can be into the snifter and foamed up a thick , gooey brown that left lacing everywhere . beautiful . the smell is strongly of licorice , backed up by some roasted malts and chocolate . very little hop presence , but there is just enough to let you know it is there . a bit hot on the alcohol . the taste starts verrry sweet and then is cut by the strength of licorice and sent bitter until the end . very interesting combination . the mouthfeel is lighter than i was expecting , but still very heavy , just enough carbonation . this beer is a sipper , it is hard to get down a full bottle , but it is definitely a nice offering from dfh .'

S'served in a pint glass . coloring was pale yellow . the head disappeared rather quickly and did not lace at all . it smelled of roasted corn and rice . zero hops detectable . the taste was that of a bmc lager , blande and leaving me wanting more . light body . i gave it a 3.0 in drinkability because it went down easy and left zero aftertaste . i would buy it if pabst or bmc were the only choices .'

S"persistent beige head sits atop a ruddy , lightly hazy brown brew . loose lace is left . the aroma is dominated by milk chocolate and dark caramel sweetness complemented by surprisingly light banana fruity esters . slight sour apple tartness eeks into the end of the aroma . flavorwise , nutty malt and prune like fruitiness quickly yield to dark , raisiny special b and mellow chocolate malt . sweetness is akin to diluted molasses and is well controlled , not overbearing , but is somewhat one dimensional . light on the palate all around , smooth in mouthfeel and highly drinkable . mild banana ester reemerge in the otherwise neutral and slightly watery finish . westmalle 's double is surprisingly understated and shy in malt and yeast character , but is nonethless very well balanced and highly drinkable ."

S'bottle inspection : best if consumed before 12 and 20 notched on the label , sampled on 8 and 27 ( given its an anniversary beer , i cant really get after them for not putting the year ) . nice folksy art on the front and story on the back , but no technical info ( abv . etc . ) aroma : slightly perfumed hop and citric notes . hops run peppery ( saaz ? ) and the citric notes are light orange peel . appearance : perfectly transparent shiny gold glass with a very respectable half finger of tight white head that gave curtains of lace . flavor : full bittering hop and well balanced by a cracker malt . the flavors blend well and while the hops are on the bittering end , they dont burn or become overbearing in any way and there is a nice lemon rind twist in the finish . a well put together beer ! mouthfeel : carbonation is a bit heavy , on the edge of foamy , but given the light body the overall impression is almost airy . overall impression : frankly , i wasnt expecting much . abita is a fair brewery that im fond of for sentimental reasons ( as many mardi gras veterans are ) , but this is a well crafted brew . happy 20th abita ! heres to the next 20 ; cheers !'

S"good medium amber color and decent head retention . smells a bit hoppy and sweet . this beer holds it down , and is a favorite of mine . however , it has a few misgivings that make it near the bottom of my list of beers i 'd buy and keep on hand in my home . it is too sweet a beer , i dont know if that is indicative of all vienna lagers , or just this one , but its too sweet . carbonation is also a bit overwhelming , especially when its too cold , which is why you need to drink it at 40- 45 degrees , not the crazy freezing temperatures they would normally serve it at bars . that being said , this beer broke the way for commercially acceptable `` good '' beers . it deserves a place in history for that . a really good brew , not great , but good ."

S"the canquest ( tm ) rolls on , this time with a big cock ! from the can : `` pasteurized to insure optimum quality '' . my pour produced two fingers of rocky , bone-white head with decent retention . color was a sunshine yellow with ne-quality clarity . nose smelled strongly of adjuncts , especially corn , like silage . back to the aals after a brief hiatus . oh well . mouthfeel was medium and it tasted faintly lager sweet with an overlay of adjuncts . it was pretty much the same old same old as far as i was cancerned . if i were ever asked to do a blind taste test , i could easily recognize the style , but to identify the brand would be well nigh impossible . the finish was kind of watery and even a little bland . it was drinkable , but it was also a dime-a-dozen . oh well , on to the next such beer . it does not seem like i am going to run out of aals in a can to try any time soon . no way is it worth seeking out and i would take up cooler space only if it were the only beer available ."

S"i was introduced to this beer after complaining about how shitty american beers were in compairson to some of the finer foreign beers . this is a huge step up in my opinion from almost all the beers you 'll find at the average college party . from bottle to going down the hatch this beer screams quality . dark and malty it reminds of some types of guiness and even has a slightly bitter aftertaste . soon after it become the beer of choice to give someone who `` hates beer '' . it 's not perfect but it 's an exceptional beer with my only complaint being it 's very hard to find outside of the central us ."

S"a caveat : this beer i am reviewing is apparently an experimental trial run , and its formulation at this time is not necessarily the brew that will eventually ( perhaps ) bear the same name . it is having quite a little difficulty in the pangs of infancy . and i do n't think the cask treatment helped its cause , whatsoever . on-cask at whole foods cask ale tasting at cigar city . i was not impressed with this beer , nor was any one of the other five people i was with . it pours a very hazy deep brown hue , like dark and cloudy iced tea , with no head . not surprising for cask ale . it smells very pickled , with overwhelming impressions of rye , caraway and way too much booze . the taste is the same as the smell , but the booze is even more out of control , and not in a good way . there is also a rancid grapefruit impression . i get the feeling that bottles of rotgut whisky were dumped into this brew , it seems quite adulterated . the feel is not good , flat and syrupy with very unpleasant lingering flavors . while i do not particularly care for the regular version of this beer , i absolutely loathed this one ."

S'this is the best light beer that i have tasted . it is far better than the typical american light beers ( bud , coors , miller , etc. ) . i would even say this beer could almost compete against some non-light beers . if i cared much for my caloric intake this would be the brew that i would drink . before this beer , i had practically given up on light beers and figured none would have enough oomph to please my taste buds . this was leftover from some visitors at my house-party . comparing this to the standard sam adams is unfair , but this is a good light version of it . it has much less body and has a much harder time holding any head . it has a pleasant light hop flavor . it is very drinkable . all in all , it is possibly the best light ever .'

S"from the bottle , it pours a medium brown color with a coppery glow in the light . it is quite clear with no hazing , tiny bubbles that quickly build a half-finger thick head of off-white foam that dissipates just as quickly , and leaves minimal clean spotty lacing as it recedes . it has a different aroma than i 'm used to , and fits the autumn bill very well . there are hints of candied hazelnuts , a very light touch of chocolate , gently roasted malts and sweet caramel . everything is followed up by the slightest bit of warmed brown sugar . the nut brown reminds me of the week before christmas , when the house is a continual rotation of smells of sugary treats , pies , and just lots of down home cooking . sounds of families mingling and laughing , compromising personal space to appreciate the one time a year everyone seems to get along ... and this beer there to help it all go smoothly . speaking of smooth , though the initial tastes came across almost spicy and thick with carbonation on impact with my tongue , it quickly turned thin before i swallowed . the medium carbonation with a thin mouthfeel seem to make this beer a little more watery , but it 's all rounded out with the taste . it presents a tangy nuttiness with sweetly toasted malts , a hint of chocolate again , and something buttery . there are virtually no hops present and therefore it lacks a certain bitterness i 've come to love about beer . although both the smell and the taste are quite faint and lacking robustness in comparison to most of the other beers i 've tried , this ale is really very quaffable and distinct in its own sweet nuttiness . holding no aftertaste whatsoever , this is a great drink to have regardless of the situation , unless of course you 're looking for something a little more interesting ."

S"purchased a while ago at mass bev in lawrence . i figure it 's about time to give these mikeller brews a try ... appearance : looks almost like molasses as it pours from the 22oz . bottle . this stuff looks thick and decadent . darker than the darkest night . if it looked like this outside , i 'd expect a vampire to wander by my window . that 's how crazy dark this brew is . pours a very large mocha colored head that slowly recedes leaving very sticky lacing all around the sides of the glass . smell : smells of uber-coffee hit you right out of the bottle even prior to pouring . small hints of oats . roasted smells predominate this hearty brew . roasted oats , roasted chocolate , roasted nuts , roasted vanilla beans , etc ... taste : this ris has an incredibly balanced taste . after the roasted coffee blast on the nose , i was expecting something along those lines , but the malts of this beer definitely win out . the chocolates and vanillas , the smoothness of the oats , and the slight tinge of licorice . mighty interesting indeed ! mouthfeel : this has a solid feel . it 's not quite as heavy as it appears on the pour , but this is definitely an ris through and through . the roasted notes do linger for a while after each sip making this a great sipping beer for those leisurely evenings around the house . drinkability : i think this one bottle will do nicely for me . it has all the right tastes , and the 7+ abv provides a nice warming sensation while not smacking you across the face . i do n't think this could ever be a sessionable beer , nor do i think it was ever meant to be . at its current price , this beer will become one of those once in a while beers for me ."

S"i tend to group breweries into `` countries of inspiration '' categories , and capital is a down-the-line german brewery . so it should come as no suprise that their `` brown ale '' tastes more like a vienna lager . after all , that is the vibe they rock . the beer pours a nice light brown , almost a deep gold with a nice white head . the head manages to survive the best efforts of my whiskers to destroy it , and it leaves some lacing on the way down to boot ! the beer smells like toffee and fresh cooked bread . there is also a vague estery presence from the yeast but i ca n't quite put my finger on it . it is very fruity , but not overwhelming . the fresh , crusty bread note carries over into the taste . but the toffee is strangely absent and has been replaced by a nice , light chocolate . the fruit medly also makes a nice showing here , taking backseat to the malt but in doing so it compliments them . the mouthfeel is nice a light . the beer has a nice , knacky , dry germanic finish that i relish . the carbonation is light and does n't get in the way , hardly noticable . i dig this brew . but i think it suffers from being between worlds . the english esters get in the way of the overall germanic quality of the brew , while the name of the beer leads one to expect more of an english malt character . i really like it , but it is a style bender in an area where styles are rarely bent ."

S"1995 vintage ... definitely the oldest beer i 've had to date . pours a dark brown with no head , normally i would rate the appearance lower because of this but due to the age of the bottle no carbonation was expected . smells like strong raisins , port , chocolate , oak , ash , earthy earthy deliciousness . the taste is amazing , almost a bitter bakers chocolate up front with a warming malty goodness in the rear . perfect blend of flavors , nothing jumps out . very chewy , but amazingly smooth beer , just a touch of bitterness on the start , finishes remarkably clean . i could not drink more than a nip of this , so the packaging is perfect . but i could see myself sitting in front of a fire sipping this quite often . delicious beer and something that really needs to be tasted to be appreciated ."

S"got this because it was from great divide ( makes yeti ) , and because of the name . appearance : poured into a tulip pint and did n't see any foam forming , so i poured faster . apparently bridget does n't give head ( or not much ) . dark reddish color . smell : best part of this beer . distinct olive smell , bit of sweetness , and otherwise malts . the malt smell increases as the beer warms . i do n't recall ever smelling olives on a beer before , and it 's nice . taste : not bad , but not great . that olive smell only translates a little to the taste . normal coffee and roasted malt stout/porter taste , decently balanced , with a minor contribution from the alcohol . stronger bitter aftertaste than the flavor would suggest . mouthfeel : a little thinner than it could be , but the carbonation comes out in the mouth , helping it along . drinkability : i 'd only have one of these at a time , partly due to the aftertaste ."

S'a : pours a nice dark brown with slight ruby hues and a decent head that recedes to a thin film but leaves very nice lacing in the glass . s : nice soft bourbon smell fills the nose with the candied malts hiding in the back . t : a sweet caramel taste with the bourbon riding along . the bourbon is pretty well balanced here . m : smooth , thick , and creamy makes this beer oh so good . d : the only place where this loses points is the abv . the 10.2 % it clocks in at this year ( 2008 ) is pretty well hidden but a few could easily catch up to you . i love this beer though and plan on stocking up on the next release !'

S"12oz bottle into a perfect pint , courtesy of rtrain12 ( thanks , ryan ! ) a - pale gold , just a little bit cloudy . nice , towering three fingers of head that has some decent retention . not much lacing . s - i had a pliny before this one , and i have to say that the aroma is not very far off . this has some outstanding notes , including grapefruit and pine . it 's very reminiscent of a west coast ipa . very nice . t - very much a letdown after the nose . there 's a bit of the hops , but not much . some sweetness , in the cotton-candy area , and some notes of yeast and bread . no alcohol detected at all . m - medium-bodied and smooth . d - i could drink this all day , all night , and all the next day . off the charts . o - while it 's an outstanding everyday brew , the flavor is a bit lacking and leaves me wanting . still very good ."

S"sounded intriguing- an imperial stout aged for 6 months in old rye whiskey barrels , then , served on cask . it was actually pretty disappointing . pure black body , but no head or lace . nose was straight american whiskey- all vanilla , oak , and alcohol . no imperial qualities- if i wanted bourbon , i would have ordered some maker 's mark . tasted strongly like a bourbon as well , with strong alcohol and vanilla . if i really stretched my imagination , i was able to discern some light fruity , vinous flavors . dry and alcoholic . did not work for me . mouthfeel was flat , lifeless , thin , and watery- perhaps the aging stripped the body from this brew . i could not drink this- i actually sent it back . oh well ."

S"as i posted in my gluek ice review , the word `` ice '' in beer is something that college kids tend to look for . it means cheap , low taste beer that results in a fast buzz . if you did n't buy this to get drunk , then why did you ? there is nothing going on here beer wise . it really had to be made with the intention of getting drunk , and fast . no one in the right mind would enjoy this beer casually drinking it . you chug it and after 6 or so you will start to enjoy it more and more . hey , its drinkable , thats about all i can say ."

S"sixer from the lcbo . pours a nice reddish-gold with a huge frothy head . the head has really good lasting power , and laces to the bottom of the glass . this is probably the best looking lager i have seen in a long time.the aroma is full of leafy hops with only the faintest hint of malt - its nice but could be more upfront . the taste is very good , slightly sweet malts lead through to a mildly bitter hoppy middle , before tailing off into a grainy dryness . there 's a nice caramel and spice flavour underlying it all . the body seemed a bit light , and maybe a bit more weight would have made it more satisfying , but that 's a minor quibble . the drinkability is ridiculous - this could be enjoyed all night long . an eminently sessionable lager , and an excellent flagship beer from sam adams ."

S'a favorite of mine for reading on a cold evening . it looks very nice when poured , some head going away quickly enough for the first drink . the smell is the carmel . the actual taste is a nice light bock . any carmel taste , to my impression , is from the smell . some posters say they taste/smell brown sugar . i do not taste that exactly , but something sweet is in the mix . i like mine chilled , and in a pint glass . the taste is very good for reading and drinking , a drink every few minutes or so . this is not a beer to sit around and really put back while watching football or the like , drinking it quickly or having more than two at a sitting gets overly sweet .'

S"at the office , in morristown , nj . at first blush , you are probably saying , 'ramstein ... ipa ? ? ? what 's a german beer style specialist doing brewing this beer ? ' well , this beer is actually the winning brew in this year 's office homebrewers competition , but since it was brewed on contract with high point and is now on tap in every office location with a ramstein taphandle , i figured i 'd give it a review , with the hopes of high point brewing it again . into a pint glass , it poured a cloudy amber/copper , with one finger of white head , that retained seemingly forever , and laced very well . very little visible carbonation . i am not sure , but the nose definitely smelled of dry-hoppiness , with a pungent dry herbal aroma , in addition to orange peel , apple and pear . the taste revealed the aforementioned fruit initially , and then dissolved to a bitter orange peel , very dry finish . medium thickness , and way smooth ; no carbonation felt whatsoever , and very creamy'ish . i forgot to ask what the abv was on this beer , but whatever it was , it was well-hidden , and super-drinkable . a great session ipa . hopefully high point continues to branch out into more beer styles outside the german umbrella , if they are going to make them this good ."

[ edit : knocking the drinkability score back further . really running out of gas on this one . ] not on the level of a belgian quad ( you might argue it 's a borderline quad to begin with ) but then , what is ?"

S"this beer was bought strictly for the novelty aspect and based on my personal preference of spicy foods . with this in mind my grading/judging of this beer is done with such a mind set . a - it looks like a regular cerveza but with a green tint to it . which is probably due to any pickling affect that the pepper went through while settling in the beer . a little bit of fuzz upon first crack but goes away as soon as it comes . s - like a pepper in a beer . you get a hint of the pepper spice but nothing poignant or over-whelming . t - upon t he first pass over the tongue it tastes like a regular cerveza , nothing fancy . after a couple of seconds you start to feel a twinge of spiciness from the pepper that is at the bottom of the bottle . i thought it was a nice kick and would serve great with chips or other mexican style dishes . to best explain the after taste . it is that of those pickled peppers that one can place on salads or subs . m - yet again much like other cervezas ; just with a pepper twist at the end . drank it at room temperature so curious to see if drinking it cold affects any aspect of the beer . smooth at room temperature . enjoyed the spicy tones left on palate . d - this is a type of beer that i would enjoy one of . if i had bought a six pack of it , it would be shared with me and at least 9 other people . this due to the fact that i doubt that six individuals would actually enjoy this beer enough to drink an entire one . well except for me , i enjoyed it and ate the pepper found at the bottom of the bottle . like i said at the beginning of this review , bought based on novelty and hopes of there being notes of pepper 's spiciness . with this in mind , beer accomplished what i had sought out from it . was not looking for high alcohol or great taste . just a weird beer with a spicy kick to it . i would drink it again , but if someone offered it to me . also , considering my tastes ; i would not offer it to someone else . for it seems that spicy foods/drinks that i enjoy others do not enjoy because it is too spicy or they do not like spicy foods . maybe i should find new friends ? just kidding ."

S"plenty of yeast swirling around in the bottle , but it makes an absolutely limpid pour , with no head -- not even a slight film of foam across the top . carbonation is terrible . probably because of the flatness , there 's hardly any aroma . if i put my nose about a centimeter from the top of the beer , i can smell a modest fruitiness . on tastes the flavor comes through a bit more clearly : light cloves , moderate fruitiness . appropriate flavors , but no `` zing '' present . mouthfeel : the flatness makes it terrible . this beer is a bit like a beginning homebrewer 's first attempt at hefeweizen ... and probably they either under-kraussened it , or opened it too soon . not worth buying . ( on later edit : i 've opened 2 more bottles of this , and each has been as flat as the first . i 'm just chunking the rest in the trash . knocking down the drinkability a couple notches because i 'm sure i did n't just get an off bottle ) ."

S"pours a golden , slightly hazy color . a fluffy white ( very white ) head sits on top , with a good amount of bubbles streaming up the middle . the aroma is fresh , and very strong of herbs . it would be easy to say this is over spiced , but i thought it was really nice . parsely comes through and is instantly recognizable . the rosemary seems to be the strongest of all , and is fresh and of high quality . traditional beer aromas are minimal , with just enough yeast character to indicate that this is a beer your smelling and not a spice rack . so instead of reviewing this as a saison , i 'm considering it a spiced/herbed beer , and for that i ca n't think of a better use of herbs in a beer . the flavor is also bordering on overwhelming , but it 's still tasty , and in a way , balanced . foccacia bread comes to mind first . there is also more of the base saison flavor than in the nose . even though it 's minimal , the saison style really complements the beer . it 's sweet and yeasty up front , with the nose really helping to bring out all the flavors . a full , robust herbal flavor is found in the middle , while the finish is dry and spicy . i really get the feeling that the brewers did a lot of tweaking to balance the flavors and bring out the herbs in the beer the best they could . the mouthfeel is light bodied , but firm . there is a good level of carbonation , and a dry finish that complements the herbal flavor . the only downside to this beer is that it 's almost strictly a novelty . it was very nice to try , and i 'll get it again , but as far as drinkability goes , this is a treat beer that is more of an experience than it is a traditional beer ."

S"my first crack at a berliner weiss . 16.9oz bottle poured into a tulip glass . this one pours a pale golden/straw color with a bit of haze . so many tiny bubbles make its appearance almost champagne-like . a fizzy , towering head quickly recedes to a thin ring which is only kept alive by its highly active carbonation . smells at first like sweet grains . wheat and a small amount of citric zest come through . after a while of sniffing and trying to pinpoint the aroma , i finally settled on apple sauce . it makes me think of a big bowl of apple sauce . nothing overwhelming , but it 's there . tastes mildly citric . a wave of sweetness from the wheat . a nice drying tartness . nothing overwhelming in the way of sourness- the slight pucker actually is quite pleasing . fizzy , spritzy carbonation lighten the body , but the flavors are washed clean and it seems a bit thin . however , the pleasing tartness and the clean finish make this one highly drinkable . an extremely refreshing beer for the summer ."

S'poured into a nonic pint glass . pours a dark brown clear color with small off white head , thats leaves minimal lace and very little head behind . brew smells of sweet caramel malts , bready , and a grain smell . not much scent . brew tastes carbonated and finishes refreshing , has no real punch to it in any direction . can taste the sweet caramel malts and not much else . very ho-hum . this is an easy drinking brew , but really is just too bland for me . i wouldnt be offended by it , and it wouldnt offend if it was at a party . but it just is kind of lackluster .'

S"i hate to say this , but as a big anheuser-busch fan ( sorry to admit that to some folks ) , this beer totally disappointed me . i would like to say it may have been a pack that was cooled , warmed , cooled then warmed again , but it still could n't be this bad . in reading past reviews , it seems there may have been a bad batch . i see it goes from a good call to low 2 's in ratings . i 'll give this another shot , but i did not like this a bit ."

S'appearance : a little darker than i thought a light beer would be . smell : a little fruity , a little nonexistent . taste : a little nutty , somewhat bland . mouthfeel : very light , a little sharp drinkability : exceptional . i had this beer at a sandals resort in turks & caicos . my other choices were red stripe , macro brews , or hard liquor / mixed drinks . i enjoyed this beer . i brought a six pack of this home from my trip , and it is less exciting to drink in my living room than it was to drink on the beach or in the pool . overall , i think it was the best beer that i had at the resort . i did have the amber version of this beer in the airport before we left , but i do not have enough of a memory to review it now . i do remember that i liked it much better , very similar taste except richer and fuller .'

S"got this can from my brother when he went down to the states . america 's oldest brewery eh ? well maybe the us 's but i believe in america as a whole , molson 's been around longer . that 's enough of the history lesson , lets see how this one fares . appearance : good clarity and carbonation and it did produce two fingers of head . however lack of lacing and retention bring this one back down to earth . as a red/amber lager this one is certainly walking the line as it seems to be more of a light orange . smell : slight scent of roasted barely , and that is it . nothing bad , nothing exceptionally good , nothing all the strong either . taste : well , it tastes like how it smells , the entire beer has the taste of roasted barley which then ends with a light dusting of refreshing hops . there is a certain charm this beer has in it 's simplicity . mouthfeel : nothing much to complain about , but nothing really exceptionally noteworthy . it seems to do everything decently . the carbonation is a little high but not excessive . there is n't really much in the way of aftertaste or transitioning , but it does n't really need either . drinkability : much more light and refreshing then you would expect from an amber lager which is good , and it adeptly avoids the hay like taste that other lagers suffer from . just a nice , smooth drinker . final thoughts : well , as i commented about molson earlier , this beer seems to be very similar to molson canadian , in that it is a marker beer . when you think , what an average generic beer should taste like , this one fits the bill . it 's not bad , it 's just ... well what it is . i 'd pickup a six pack for the right price of course , but it 's not going to knock your socks off ."

S'almost copper with big tan foamy/frothy head with good retention and nice lacing . sweet floral and pine aroma . sweet floral citrus flavors with unique pine counterbalance . sweetness dominates and finishes with a moderate hop linger . very tacky and foamy feel . this one hop seems to have all the hop flavors rolled into one ( if they really only used the one hop ) . however , the label states that it also has what i took to be a lighter , non-resinous feel . what your left with is a mouthcoating , very tacky feel that lingers on and on and becomes a huge distraction . very nice flavor and aroma , unique even but not one i look forward to having again because of the feel .'

S'surprisingly , i have never had this beer before in my life . i felt a little curious today so i picked up a sixer this afternoon . as far as looks go , this one is a very nice looking macro lager . about a one finger head that stays the entire time . plenty of bubbles in the beer to keep the stark white head replenished . crystal clear light bronze in color . most other beers in this genre have a tiny head that leaves in a fizzy hurry ; this one never leaves . nondistinct smell . maybe little corn aroma but nothing that would deter me from drinking this beer . husky , slightly malty . a little sweet . nice flavor profile . clean and crisp . a little sweet . some hop bitterness as well , which seems unusual . this was pretty tasty . i have to say , this may be my new go-to beer . i had a favorite but this one may be my new one . clean tasting with a dry and crisp finish . i think a 12pack will be in my refrigerator in the very near future .'

S'clear , amber-bronze in hue ; the liquid looks pleasant but not too marzen-like . off-white head , at the apex the foam was one finger tall . head retention was fair ; the bubbles steadily fell to a soapy cap . there was no subsequent lacing . overall , this isnt a bad looking beer ; nothing wrong with average . the nose is clean , no its empty with a background aroma of caramel malt and dark fruits . marzens should be malty with some earthy/spicy hops in the background . not too surprisingly this version lacked this ; it doesnt smell like a marzen . not inviting . frankly i found it offensive to my principles , dont call this a marzen ! yuck . is this really even a lager ? vaguely malty upfront with some nice but fleeting caramel notes . some dark fruits as well . hey , not bad but the finish is clean and empty with metallic notes . any sense of maltiness falls apart as well . again , the fact they brew with extracts is way too obvious . in a blind taste test i would never call this a marzen . i would never call it good either . there just isnt anything here ; bland , empty , and lacking direction . of the dozen beers from ak ive tried this is one of the least offensive but also further from the style they are aiming for . whatever medium-light in body , heavy carbonation , the mouthfeel is grating yet rather watery . the mouthfeel is unpleasant . drinkable ? no . do i foresee a reason to drink this again ? no . should you ? no ; this beer sucks . sadly , this was one of the more praised beers at the opening day tasting . by praised i mean least insulted . i purchased a bottle at the brewery . avoid .'

S"review is for the 2000 edition . executive summary : took a chance on this one , and while it 's not all i had hoped for , it 's still worth it . this has aged very well . makes me want to hold on to the 2004 bottle i just grabbed . appearance : pours a deep , murky mahogany into my snifter with a thin off-white head that reduces to little more than a film . lacing is moderate . smell : would be fantastic if it were n't for this hint of staleness i 'm sensing . wish i could tie it to something . perhaps musty is the best way i can describe it . otherwise , raisins and dates are evident . taste : wow . just wow . i thought i had tasted barleywines before . this is incredible . sticky-sweet , but not cloying up front and finishes clean , with only a slight alcoholic twinge to it . a very well balanced experience . mouthfeel : candy . my teeth are squeaking . nice for the style . drinkability : price , intensity of flavor and abv make this a one-time sipper . does n't mean i wo n't go back and grab a couple more , though ; )"

S"appearance - brown bottle with a nice blue and silver label . comments on thistle brewery and sleeman brewing . i suspect this to make the beer seem more scottish . crystal clear pale gold color with few signs of carbonation . maybe one finger of head that did not sustain whatsoever and i see white particles in the beer . not a good start . smell - corn is by far the most dominant smell here , i am catching some wheat and hops in the background though . pretty plain and standard stuff . all in all could use some more character but not bad , it 's just generic . taste - starts off a bit watery , but then turns to a nice corn and wheat flavor with a slight touch of hops at the end . not much is really going on here though , it 's pretty generic in taste . this beer was clearly designed to be hammered back . it is worth noting , the beer does n't taste chemical laden as with many cheap beers of this nature . mouthfeel - despite of weak head and no signs of it , the carbonation is quite good . aftertaste is there and lingers a bit but it is subdued . however , i seem to get some film feeling at the back of my tongue after a while . that and i would have liked a little bit of head . drinkability - my dad loves this stuff and i see why . i could drink this stuff all night or on a hot and sunny day . it 's cool , refreshing and goes down easy and as a `` buck a beer '' it deserves something of a free pass in this department . light on the stomach too . final thoughts - all in all , probably one of the best `` buck a beers '' out there . it 's clearly a buck a beer for a reason , as nothing about this beer is going to knock your socks off . however it 's surprisingly drinkable , surprisingly cheap and if you are on a budget a welcome alternative to laker , lakeport or lucky . i do n't usually buy buck a beers anymore , and the generic and often chemical taste stops me from coming back , but i would recommend it to anyone whose on a budget ."

S"a : deep tarnished copper with a fizzy beige head . a lot of very fine particulates were floating around alongside the tiny carbonation bubbles . the head only has average retention . rather than leaving lace , the beer left behind a thin trail of the particulates . s : complex beer . the smoked malts provide strong aromas of smoke , molasses , hickory and maple . hops add a bit of pepper and grass to the festivities . t : the complexity from the aromas find their way into the flavor . a combination of molasses , maple and honey make for a fairly sweet beer overall . burnt and smoked wood flavors compensate for the sweetness . bitterness provides a sharp pepper bite . the smoke flavors linger into the finish , and stay on the palate for hours after the beer is gone . i do n't think i 've ever had a beer with a finish this long . m : medium body is dry and feels almost ashen . the carbonation level felt a little high . d : this beer was a definite change of pace for me . drinkability is tough for me to judge , as i 'd have to be in just the right mood to drink another one of these . however , the beer seems an excellent example of the style . i enjoyed the beer best when i started drinking it alongside heavy cheeses ."

S"had the bcs on tap at the ginger man in nyc , somehow buying a $ 9 glass seemed more wise than the $ 20 four pack . but what the hell how often do you come across this beer on tap . a- this beer is dark as a black hole . zero light penetration , i can feel the time and gravity getting sucked into the glass . : ) it arrived in a snifter with no head at all that is to be expected tho , the tiny bubles i found were also very dark like coffee . s- this thing stinks of burbon , that is all i really could smell . this is my first burbon barrel aged brew so i did n't know what to expect . to be honest i was a bit shocked , everytime i went for a sip i thought i was about to drink burbon . t- amazing complex taste , but again i was shocked by the burbon flavors . i thought it might be like an ipa where the brew reeks of hops but the taste is n't as strong or an oak aged brew , but this thing really tastes like booze . sipping only with beer ! m- the mouth feel is thick , but it ends nicely . the thickness slides down easily and drys the mouth in the finish . d- i lowered the score on the drinkability because it was a challenge to finish , simply because it was so strong . this beer wo n't sneak up on you thats for sure ."

S"purchased in japan , best before 2009 & # 24180 ; 6 & # 26376 ; . deep amber to pinkish-red in colour with a rocky off-white head and thick , crystalline lacing . lacing is unusually intact , must have a high protein content . carbonation uniform with fine-medium bubbles . aromas of rusty iron , autumny ale hops and dried stone fruit . enticing , perhaps served even a little cold , it would open up more at higher temperatures . bitter on the roof of the mouth but a satisfying sweetness lingers in spite of this . sweetness is not overpowering though , and the acidity of the carbonation is also noticeable . stone fruit on the palate , peach and plum , as well as a rusty hop fruitiness . satisfying but appropriately balanced - this is still a beer for a hot day , in spite of its flavoursome , slightly astringent hops . mouthfeel is dry but not unpleasant , however this sample has a slight skunkiness - not overpowering at all , just a lingering sense of not-quite-fresh that is noticeable . probably just the sample , it would be undoubtedly better enjoyed in california . in spite of this , i wish i had bought more than one bottle of this . a good beer for all seasons , except perhaps the depths of winter ( although it would be a good session beer following some heavier , meatier brews ) . overall , better than i remember , even though i remember it being good . i 'll seek out this one again ( not least considering its history and importance ) and hope to try their other creations someday ."

S'pours a dark rubbish brown beer , there is a beige head that left quite quickly , the nose is woody , fuity , very refreshing , roasted barley notes , perhaps personal but chocolate is noticeable . the taste is red fruits at first then , some red wine touch comes . after that , the strong malt taste overcome . you can clerly taste the strong abv , 18,2 . the after taste is rich , long , and malty . this is a very good oak aged stout .'

S"review from notes . had this on epic jill andrews weekend , at the show itself at nightcat in easton , md ( nice beers for such a small venue , also had a dfh indian brown ) . it was bottled and part of a bucket o ' beers promotion . made the show even better . that said , while appearance was good , and smell was strong too , the taste just did n't fulfill the burnt caramel promise on the nose . it felt a bit watery , not really big enough mouthfeel for a porter . that said , it was still a tasty brew , with not too much abv , and i could see myself repeating it if in the mood for a dark beverage in delaware . that is ... if dfh were n't so nearby ."

S"a : this 12oz bottle says it was bottled 12/18/2006 and cost $ 7.49 at my local beer emporium . it pours a rust-colored brown with a roasted 2-3 finger head . this looks as good as any of the big ipas made by stone , smuttynose and company . s : it smells like ( in order ) alcohol , honey/caramel , moist german rye bread , tomatoes , and hops . given that there are no tomatoes in the beer , that must be a result of the extra-stewed hops . the smells are not overwhelming , complementary and not particularly theatric . i like it a lot . t : there are two layers of flavor : honey/plum/rye syrup on top of more alcohol than any wine . the alcohol is hidden well , until you swallow actually , and is revealed along with some hoppiness on the hard palate . however , when i say it 's well hidden i certainly do not mean that it 's subtle . the alcohol is well hidden much like it is in schnapps . once you taste the sugar you know something silly is going on . no ipa should be this sweet . ever . m : heavy sugar syrup clears with the carbonation when you swallow . the body is quite heavy . the alcohol has a mellow bit on the back of the hard palate and the hops nip a the the tongue after you swallow . there is n't much going on , especially for an ipa . d : the 90 minute ipa is far better . this beer is expensive novelty and it 's too strong to drink in quantity ."

S"sampled from 12oz bottle , no born on date . nice amber color , no head at all , and a kind of stale look to the beer ( no carbonation ) . smells grainy , bready ... .slight malty . tastes alot like a sugar daddy , after you 've been sucking on it for 1/2 hour ... very weak tasting caramel . no hops that i picked up at all . mouthfeel a bit flat..nothing special here . but this is a very drinkable beer , i like it , but it 's not worth the cost ."

S'tasted this at the border beer bust and was a bit surprised . it was one the beers in the experimental category and it was a bit like drinking a cream soda without most of the sweetness . i almost scored it in second place for the category , but the lightness of the beer let it fall behind . excellent flavor , the vanilla is balanced with the light straw malt and the low hopping makes it extremely drinkable . i could see turning on non-beer drinkers pretty easily with this beer .'

S"it appears cloudy brownish orange with a small off colored white head . smells of caramel and molasses , there is a strong citrusy grassy hop smell as well . it tastes like caramel and brown sugar . there is a strong and complex flavor of hops there is a nice citrus flavor , a grassy flavor and a very strong bitterness . the bitterness almost completely overtakes the caramel flavor . this tastes to me like a super bitter barley wine and i 'm loving it . to put it simply there are strong flavors but they are balanced very well . the carbonation is moderate low like a traditional english barleywine . the drinkability is not so great because the flavors are so intense and the alcohol content is quite high . overall a good beer . i know this is an old bottle of this but it stood up well to time . overall a very good beer ."

S'i sampled this beer from a 12oz bottle poured into an imperial pint . golden amber in color with a one finger white head . this hangs around a while and leaves some lacing . smell is of hops and some lightly toasted malts . the hops smell citrus-like . taste is the same with a nice dry finish . this brew leaves little to no aftertaste . it would make a great palate cleanser for a spicy or heavy dish . the mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a good crisp burn from carbonation . this beer is not the very best beer i have ever tried but the price and availibility in my area make it one of my favorite session beers of all time .'

S"i tried this one again to see if i 've warmed to this brew . unfortunately , this time i seem to have soured to it ( no pun intended ) even more . appearance : nice dark reddish brown with a excellent fizzy head . smell : vinegar fumes . some fruit and wood is also noticeable . did someone mix balsamic with malt vinegar and label it as beer ? taste : god , it 's even worse than i remembered it . fruity vinegar with some tannic wood tastes . cloying sweetness makes sure you know there is plenty of sugar in here . hmmm.. this might be good to use as a base in a sweet/sour sauce . i actually managed to finish it the first time i tried it , not this time though . mouthfeel : highly carbonated . impressions : to give you some perspective . a few years ago after reading an article about how prison inmates make `` wine '' out of ketchup , juice , and fruit snacks with moldy bread as the fermentation culture . i gave it a try out of curiosity . the funky , weird smelling drink i got was still not as bad as this brew . if this was the only beer on earth , i 'd be a teetotaler . -- -old review -- - appearance : clear reddish brown body with a fizzy tan head that actually seems to amplify with time . highly carbonated and effervescent . smell : sour malt vinegar smell . i did n't expect it to be that strong . some faint fruit is also present taste : sour and sweet . slightly fruity as well . i ca n't help but feel like i 'm drinking balsamic vinegar . i would n't exactly say that these flavors are pleasant . mouthfeel : medium bodied with a lively carbonation . impressions : i 'll preface by saying that i 've never had a flemish red before , but i really tried to keep an open mind . there may be a possibility that i got a bad bottle . this just was not good . i had a really hard time even finishing it . it was like drinking balsamic vinaigrette . i 've heard this described as being `` wine-like '' , frankly if i had a wine that tasted like this , i 'd think it had spoiled . this just tasted too much like vinegar ."

S"appearance - appropriately golden , with a frothy almond head . the light bubbles make the beer look really inviting - my mouth is watering ! nice and clear too . 4.0/5.0 smell - flowery sweetness and sugar . lemon , banana and honey too . 3.0/5.0 taste - the belgian taste is dominant - all of the spice , coriander and lemon are really potent and easy to pick up on . i do n't mind the sweetness and it masks the alcohol extremely well ( and at 9.5 % abv , this one will sock it to ya ) . the use of wine grapes is different - it adds some tartness to it that you do n't normally see in a tripel . the taste changed a bit as the beer warmed . - 3.5/5.0 feel - a clean beer - there is a little aftertaste , but it 's very mild . flavor is predominately on the tongue . 3.5/5.0 drinkability - i got ta say , i enjoyed the beer , but i did n't really think it was so amazing that i would buy this by the case . i could get a bottle of new belgium tripel for about 1/2 the price . 2.5/5.0"

S'11.2oz . bottle poured into a tulip . bottle # 04128 , vintage 2006 . ( a ) - pours a hazy , almost cloudy dark brown ; almost black color that produced a quickly dissipating off-white head . ( s ) - rich & ripe dark fruits with a dense biscuit-like wheat . bits of banana & lemon with a spicy cinnamon kick or something along those lines . a tad musty in the far background from age . ( t ) - a rich maltiness that is reminiscent of raisin , honey , butterscotch , and dark ripe fruits . has a touch of dry wheat and banana at the end . warms the throat and stomach after each swallow . ( m ) - a good carbonation level and balance . reminds me of a super rich belgain dark or quad with that extra abv kick as it goes down . ( d ) - an interesting and fascinating beer . its already 4yrs old , but it could hang out for another 4 yrs with how potent this bad boy is . malty as hell , with a good sweetness . one of these is plenty for me ; this is so rich and filling . a slow sipper definitely'

S"this is one of the absolute most approachable beers i 've experienced . with all the recent conversations about approachable , easy going transition beers i wanted to start off by saying this definitely falls in that category . appearance : typical for the style . it is a pale golden color , completely translucent . head fades fast and leaves no lacing . smell : musty and sweet right up front . it is gently malty with a clear presence of some hops but it is just laid back and relaxed . taste : the taste is the same way . laid back and relaxed . this beer is interesting and good to taste but is remarkably easy to just drink with out thinking . the lightly toasted malts have a barley caramelized attribute to them . the hops character does not want you to notice it ; so well balanced and simply supporting the overall affect of the beer on the palate . there is a bit of homemade bread or dough attribute as well , maybe that is what subconsciously says take off your shoes , sit on the porch and enjoy the hell out of me . mouthfeel : the mouthfeel is incredibly smooth . this style tends to be very crisp and this one is light crispy and only gently bitter in the dry aftertaste . a bit more slick than some . drinkability : many of the characteristics of this beer may seem reserved . it may not be as big as some of you my prefer , but it is remarkably easy , one of the most enjoyable session beers i can think of . hope this is helpful . cheers !"

S"this pours a very dark amber , almost brown with an off white head . the head disipates into a thin cap as there are little to no carbonation seen rising to the top to act as support . no lacing present . smell is muted with hints of nutty malts and absolutely no hops . comes off as smelling like a brown ale and almost looks like one too . taste is dry and more of the nutty malts with a slight berr hint . despite the dry finish there is a distinct after taste that i ca n't put my finger on as to what the taste is , but i 'm not a fan of it . maybe its a poor attempt of the hops trying to break through . very drinkable and somewhat thin lifeless mouthfeel . i 'm glad i only bought one , although it seems as if other reviews have found this to be better than i . maybe things have changed with the recipe ?"

S"this is the second time i 've had this beer , and i 'm still not sure how i feel about it . there 's no comparison point . it pours a beautiful golden red color , very slightly cloudy , and i swear that it 's glowing from within . very little head , very little carbonation . smells sweet -- honey , clover , honeysuckle , and alcohol . hard to detect hops through the alcohol smell , but it 's there . the taste is complex . i 'm not terribly good at picking things apart and identifying components , but here goes : i get a little orangey/lemony citrus at the front end followed by a burst of sweetness with maybe a little oakiness . as it sits in the mouth , the hops come out , and then the alcohol burn overpowers it all . the aftertaste of the film left in the mouth is hops with a caramel character . overall , i think the incredible strength is a drawback -- the alcohol is too astringent . as it warms up , the alcohol comes out even more . it 's thick and syrupy and filmy . it clings for a long time . the beer is to big and powerful to be very drinkable . i 've been working on this one for about half an hour , and i 'm probably not quite halfway through it ( this is definitely a sipper ) . i would be interested to try this beer after aging it for a few years -- i wonder if the sweetness would mellow out ?"

S"a `` darker '' complexion that their pale , as i 'm waxing poetic i 'd call it chestnut-amber in color . poured with a bare minimum of head , but i appreciated it while it lasted ( thing is , the bartender poured the beer to damn-near overflowing ! ) hops are earthy and herbaceous , spicy and subtle all at once - i really , really enjoyed the nose on this one , and let it sit for a good minute to warm and to take in its finer qualities . a bit skunky in a good way , too . medium-bodied yet this drinks like a lighter bodied ale , and also tricks you into thinking it 's smaller somehow ; i 'm thinking this happened because i let it warm a bit ? the other thing is , last time i enjoyed this was in a smokey bar and now ( thanks to anti-smoking efforts everywhere ) no more smoke in bars to get in the way of me and my beer and this is *much* better than i remember as a result . harvest ale 's alcohol is higher than pale 's but does n't *seem* higher due to its unique body and texture . mouthfeel is definitely creamy , juicy , but amply punctuated by spicy hops . notes of honeydew melon and cherry from some of the tawnier malts used in this really give it some depth , especially as the hops add a familiar pineapple musk to this brew . and then there 's the bitterness : piney , resiny , oily hops with a touch of stinging nettles , it 's a bitterness that lingers on your palate like the acrid smoke of an old man 's favorite pipe - even in a smokeless bar ! wonderful stuff , and makes me think a lot more highly of it than just `` the smaller brother of celebration '' , even though there are some similarities . a heck of a deal too - it was 'two for one ' night . . ."

S'i drank a couplle of 11.2oz bottles last night . when i got on to write my review tonight i was very surprised at the ratings the elephant has received up to this point . it makes me wonder if everyone got a hold of old or badly handled/stored beer . i am usually reluctant at the site of imported green bottles , but i wanted to give this a try . it just came back to town after a long absence from sa . carlsberg has their place in beer history so i wanted to pay homage . the beer poured a golden color with a decent white head that left good lace in the glass . my first whiff was very slight hops and bigger malt . the flavor is malty , almost a sweet flavor . i was very surprised at how fresh this beer tasted . the second bottle was every bit as good as the first ! the 7.2 % alcohol was not evident at all in this strong lager . i hate that malt liquor label crap ! it conjures up immediate visions of mickeys or colt .45 . this is not in that category . i would put this up against checkvar or pilsner urquell anyday . i know they are not exactly the same style but as far as an imported lager goes they are close . i would strongly recommend anyone who rated this poorly in the past to give it another try . you may be pleasently surprised , i was !'

S'this brew is a pale straw color , nice big bubbly white head . good lace follows that down the glass . mix of lemony crisp malt and flowery hop on the nose . crisp grainy malt front , lemon peel and a good level of bittering hops for this style . fairly creamy , full mouth . quite a refreshing beer that i will be enjoying after a day of blading this summer .'

S"pour is brilliant deep yellow with a monster white head on top ... too much head actually , very difficult to get this beer out of the bottle because of all of the carbonation . nose is very yeasty , with a strong spicy , peppery edge . sour grass like most jolly pumpkin beers . flavour starts out tart , almost fruity . it then segues into light peppery sour tones with oak highlights , crisp finish . much less aggressive in the sour department than most of the jp beers . mouthfeel , not altogether thick , but well-carbonated , good hop action , with a strong oak tone in the middle and a good , wine-like dryness , interesting . drinkability , decent but not amazing . in terms of the beer itself , it 's tasty but not particularly remarkable . in terms of rebuy , it 's a skosh pricey , so i 'm not in a hurry to pick it back up again . the bottom line : jp has carved out a mi niche for themselves as purveyors of sour beer . oro is another example of the style , but it is subdued enough to possibly have some more cross-over appeal . i personally found it solid but not remarkable . i do like the oak presence though ."

S'12-oz can . pours dark but not opaque . small persistent head . nicely coats the glass . a fruity aroma , apple , i think . some caramel notes also present . anise , too . chocolate notes are milk chocolate rather than the sharper varieties . excellent malty sweetness up front with medium intensity . hops are subtle and finish cleanly . a very pleasant texture with medium body and a soft creamy texture : very pleasant . highly drinkable . overall a very pleasant beer .'

S"pale to medium pale color , medium carbonation , very quickly dissapating head . boy is this beer corny , like me ... i thought this tasted like a slightly hoppy american pilsner . much better than your run of the mill gas station malt liquor in a paper bag , cept ' for liqor de ' malt . the alcohol wasnt really prevalant . goes down smooth , no burn , for that matter not much aftertaste either . i think this would be a good transition beer for some who feel they like their bud but are willing to go out on a limb . its not overly different but if you look for it there is something enjoyable here ."

S'i have been blessed two days in a row , yesterday i drank delirium nocturnum and today i am drinking stone 9th . the beer looks extremely good as it sits in my glass . it pours a dark straw gold with a beautiful creamy white cascading head . excellent lacing , color and head retention combine in this beer to give it a very appetizing appearance . the nose of this beer speaks of floral hops . there is also a sweet malt presence detectable behind the forefront floral aroma . would like a little more from the aroma its good but i think that something more complex could have been achieved . as the beer warms alcohol becomes more apparent . the taste of this beer is unique . i really do like it . the first thing to hit my tongue is the hops , a boquet of floral tastes first hit my tongue and continue to linger into the aftertaste . what makes this beer interesting is that there is a very noticable sweet malt taste ( caramel ) that hits the front of the tongue after the inital floral hop taste . it lingers for a moment and nicely balances the previous and still present floral taste before quitely slipping away just as suddely as it appeared . again i think something more complex could would benefit this brew . alcohol is somewhat evident in the taste . i definitely prefer arrogant bastard over this when it comes to strong ales . 9th anniversary is a medium bodied creamy beer in the mouth and feels real good . this is a beer i would definitely drink more of , however this is the only bottle i have and it being a limeted edition release that would not be possible . its too bad really this is quite a good beer . i feel though that as i keep drinking this beer the hop taste that was somewhat aggressive to begin with is less and less aggressive with each sip . i think that the floral taste is easily wearing out my palate . seems like with every sip it tastes different than the one before . i know that many beers flavor profiles change as the beer warms , however i have never had one change so much as this one . i think my palate is getting worn out from the hops . it makes it hard to determine the flavor profile of this beer . the high use of hops in this beer deteoriating my palate make this beer harder to drink than it should be . it feels like i am drinking a new beer each time i take a sip .'

S'on tap @ o briens . pours light red , nose of apricots and soury ( new word ) goodness . fruit notes start to pop as the beer warms up . not much flavor on the front of my pallate but heavy fruit aromas in the middle and a slight bitterness on the finish . slight head disipates quickly with a light lacing left on of top . for such a high abv and sour beer it is very drinkable . i plan on drinking quite a few of these tnite . cheers !'

S"pours a crystal clear garnet hue with a medium head that fades to a ring after a few minutes . aroma is malty bock elements and just a little campfire . taste is mild malt , mostly very dry . good caramel brown ale sweetness but not really sweet , some very light fruity element , some dry cocoa powder . dusty smoked malt , charcoal , not overwhelming or obvious but building throughout the glass . mouthfeel is light and easy , still a little crisp , revealing its lager base . i 've had smoked porters and other rauchbiers before , but this is unlike anything i 've tried and is difficult to compare to anything else . based on a traditional munich oktoberfest/marzen recipe , according to the brewer . ps : this review was written from a freshly brewed sample . i had it again after a few days and the smokey flavor is much clearer , a little more robust . might have had time to settle a bit . pps : the flavor continues to improve as this beer matures for a couple of weeks . smokey flavors have deepened from a light smoke to more of a darker campfire nature . yum ."

S"poured from a bottle into a nonic . pours a golden straw with a modest thin head that dies immediately and leaves no residue . no cloud . aroma is of weak malt and corn adjuncts . not very much to say . flavor is of weak sweet malt and corny flavored adjuncts . there may be no corn here , but it tastes like there is . slightly fruity yeast hit is a redeeming quality , but it only comes throiugh cold . as the beer warms it gets more mediocre . i know hops are supposed to be light in the style , but this beer has so little it 's hard to even detect . i hate to say if the hops were light struck , i might be able to taste them more . sweet crackery bread and a touch of honey on the middle , mixed with a spoonful of thin wheatgrass smoothie . metallic and sharp edged flavors of copper and blood . this beer is slightly better than a macro adjunct lager , but not much . the malt being a bit stronger here than bmc is the only redeeming quality . mouthfeel is overly carbonated and harsh . the finish is very dry compared to the flavor . drying on the tongue , with a thin body makes it drink as easily as water . overall , i have been trying the minhas/city brewing/g . heilmann/huber/berghoff beers since they tried to expand into the craft market , and some are surprisingly decent , like the berghoff pale ale . however it seems there are more duds than winners so i think i 'll stay away a while . the fact that the label on this beer claims `` artisan collection '' and it was so mediocre at best , kinda pissed me off . ( edit to add ) if they would have just called this a `` light ale '' or soemthing besides a blonde ale , i might not have even bought it , but if i did the scores would be a bit higher for a different style . call it a `` summer ale '' or some other creative shit and you woud draw less ire and venom ."

S'same best before date as noted previously , 3/31/11 . a : smallish head on a dark , but not impenetrable , brew . a little light shines through on the edge , revealing maroon hues . there is a touch of lacing on the burgundy glass . s : nice barrel-induced aromas : scotch , vanilla , wood . t : a tasty if subdued imperial stout , which is very dominated by the springbank barrel it was aged in . there are some coffee and burnt malt flavors , but they are mild in comparison to other rises . i am pairing this with dark italian chocolate ( amedei from tuscany ) and this helps offset the extreme whiskey notes . m : this feels thinner than expected . while the carbonation is low , this is fine for the style . the finish is dry . d : the 10 % abv is only vaguely noticeable , paradox 17 works well as a sipper .'

S"well it looked real good in the glass with the creamy white head sitting on the enticing amber brew . but other than that this beer is nothing special . there is no great smell to grab your attention , maybe just a hint of malt and floral hops . the taste is creamy and smooth with just a hint of hops , but i would n't say it 's very bitter at all . overall this is a very smooth and creamy beer that has no spectacular taste . at the same time it 's enjoyable enough and it 's easy to put back a few . not usually my first choice at my local pub , but i also would never complain is someone bought me one ."

S"giant , sticky marshmallow head composed of bubbles of all sizes fills half the glass and more , quivering like gelatin where it sits above the rim . eerie orange glow extends from the head through the chestnut-colored liquid with amber highlights . lots of protein ( ? ) floating around in the beer leads to medium clarity ... with little carbonation to be seen , the head eventually dies , although very slowly . as soon as the cap leaves the bottle , the smell of clove-studded oranges fills the kitchen . after pouring , the glass fumes with gigantic odors of spiced apple , cinnamon , and nutmeg ( which in turn suggests egg nog ) . coriander gets stronger , and right quick . celery ? vegetal nosefeel ? dried flowers and cedar chips ... mental images of primaeval fern rainforests . wait , it gets weirder . heavy cinnamon and nutmeg flavors can barely stand up to coriander and celery seed . cilantro , then more nutmeg . raw , assaultive nutmeg . space alien vanilla pods . swishing in my mouth , i finally find some light toffee flavors ... but i 'm grasping for them , as i am for plum in the aftertaste . mouthfeel is prickly and almost numbing from the spice alone , slightly syrupy across the palate . nutmeg belches fit for a toho monster rev up about halfway through the bottle . judgement ? let this be made clear : everything they list on the label will be tasted in turn , and tasted big . other than that ... this beer is like psilocybin that 's been localized to affect only the tongue . as with psychedelia , the overall experience is difficult to perceive ( or verbalize ) because the mental shifts of proportion involved are just too great . a beer that bends my tongue as far back and forth as this one could be called `` fun '' to a certain extent ... but it 's just too weird for me to find truly enjoyable ."

S"serving : bomber poured into tall snifter appearance : almost black , ca n't see through it even when held up to light , very minimal off white head smell : first off i must say this beer has an impressive and wonderful aroma but it is all wrong for an imperial stout . black coffee , chocolate , roasty . smells like a great porter . taste : coffee , chocolate , roasted nuts . again much like a good porter . mouthfeel : feels thick right at first but quickly washes down the cheeks feeling very thin , low carbonation , slightly dry . drinkability : i could chug this stuff down on a cold night . alcohol was very well hidden . notes : i thoroughly enjoyed this beer but i am afraid someone must have switched the labels . i was tempted to rate it much higher than i did , but could n't do it . everything about this beer screamed porter ! i love porter and this would be a fine example of that style but it took major hits on a lot of points because it is just a poor example of its style . the smell was not of imperial stout but i loved it so much that i rated it highly anyway on that category ."

S"pours a dark mahogany , but very clear . the head is thin in consistency and hieght , and does not retain very well or leave any lacing . the nose is mostly clean , just some faint toasted dark amber malt and noble hop aromas . roasted and smoky flavor , with a generous dose of skunk . in the aftertaste , the off-flavor turns medicinal and astringent , which will eventually ruin the finish and drinkability . mild carbonation and a light body . perhaps this was lightstruck , but if this is how it 's supposed to taste , there is a gross imbalance of taste that ruins what would be a smooth mouthfeel ."

S"schmidt premium pours a lofty creamy head over a pale , clear brew . the nose is your typical macro beer corn and rice funk . carbonation is hyperactive after a hard pour , but tapers off to a steady stream . flavor is slightly sweet corn with a hint of grass in the finish , which i was a bit surprised by- still this is an old man beer all the way . i love the rainbow trout on the can- time was it was what was on the outside of the can that distinguished a brew , not the contents ( which were about the same ) . i used to really like the cans with the scenes of 50 's type pipe smoking dads hunting and fishing and whatnot . it sure beats reality , which is real dad types swilling beer just like this and pissing off the side of their boats or having close calls in deer camp . ahh well . nostalgia kicks ass but this beer does not . it would be funny seeing the look on the face of one of those guys after they accidentally took a big slug off a can of bender thinking it was just like schmidt ..."

S'poured into a maudite snifter yeilded an extremely dark liquid that has a beautiful head that was stubborn and stuck around for a while . lots of hops . next to smuttynose imperial stout this is probably the most hoppy ris i have ever had . pine and grapefruit dominate the hop character with chocolate and a hint of coffee dominating the malt aspect , with some cherries in the mix as well . chocolate , dark berries , prune and coffee . a very hoppy beer with some bitterness coming from both the hops and the roasted character . alcohol is hidden very well but still contributes a warming character . next to darklord this is the most viscous mouthfeel i have ever experienced . a fantastic ris that i will seek out again in the future . i would be curious to see how age mellows the hops and changes this brew .'

S"i 've had this bottled or canned , right now i 'm drinking out of a can poured into a glass . appearance : a typical american golden color -- not pale yellow , but actually goldish looking , so i 'll give it a little credit there . smell : frankly , not good . it does n't really bring to mind any beer ingredients , maybe a faint faint hint of a dash of hops . otherwise it smells fairly unpleasant . taste : unlike the smell , i actually enjoy the taste quite a bit . immediately it presents almost no taste while in the mouth , especially if `` your beer is cold '' ( blue mountains -- great idea ... ) . however , the aftertaste is pleasantly sweet , making it actually a very acceptable 'banquet beer ' . mouthfeel : not much here . it 's pretty light . maybe just the tiniest bit overcarbonated , but far from unpleasant . drinkability : i 'll give this beer credit . the general blandness of the beer actually helps support its name of 'banquet beer ' , because it wo n't interfere with the taste of the food . however , the aftertaste makes it an enjoyable beer to quaff with a meal . its 5.0 % abv rating makes it a beer you could enjoy over a long meal and into the night . overall , imo , better than any miller product or bud product . probably my favorite generic , cheap american beer ."

S"on-tap at the toronado . a : inviting cloudy yellow/straw color with generous head that laces down the glass as i drink . s : fruity , floral , belgian malts . a little bit of spice is detected . a fairly muted smell , though -- i 'd be more impressed with some pungency so it did n't require so much swirling to bring out the aromatics . t : banana , citrus , crisp wheat , and light spice ( clove , coriander ) . not a lot of flavor evolution , but 's a clean , crisp profile that refreshes quite well . m : crisp , with lively carbonation . but it feels a bit watery . i 'll have to revisit this and see . d : good session beer , but not so impressive and flavorful that i 'll seek this out over 'average ' and cheaper witbiers ."

S"appearance : clear golden peach body . moderate carbonation . a loose foamy head of 2 inches with minimal agitation in the pour . nice overall look . smell : not really strong , this has subtle smells of fresh hops , dried flowers , freshly cut grass , some light tropical fruit . taste : this is a delicate ale , not a hop soup like ruination or dreadnaught . this has a real dry malt base , with little residual flavors from the sugars . the 8.5 % abv is very well concealed , and this drinks very lightly . the hops impart little in expressive flavor ; rather , they only contribute their own real taste . this tastes like fresh hops , raw and green , fresh from the plant . these do n't even taste cured , they do n't give the multitude of flavors that hops can create . fresh cut grass , perhaps some pineapple and orange , not quite as much ascerbic grapefruit of others but some . this finishes with a marked bitterness ; it 's obvious that some high alphas were used . overall , i like this very much . it 's much more approachable than most dipas , and i could actually drink a few of these . mouthfeel : light for such a big beer . really delicate , nicely put together . not cloying at all . drinkability : this is the most drinkable dipa i 've ever had . this is n't so noisy that it can only be had in a single serving . i really enjoy this , and even though it may not be last year 's groundbreaking version , it 's still very good and a great departure from the sloppy `` let 's throw everything in except the kitchen sink `` dipas that have recently come into fashion . a nice accomplishment ."

S"i had this on tap at the cloverleaf tavern in caldwell , nj . it was served in a southern tier tulip . look : very orange ! it had a very thin head that was a little orange as well . smell : this is probably the strong point of the beer . it reeks of pumpkin pie without being too aggressive with it . taste : this is usually where pumpkin beers fall flat with me but where pumking lives up to its name . the pumpkin pie aroma does n't dominate the taste and it actually tastes like a beer instead of some kind of pumpkin pie flavored wine cooler . feel : light bodied , nicely carbonated . very smooth and refreshing . drink : very good for this . i was surprised to see it was a 9 % abv beer . overall , this is what pumpkin beers should really aspire to taste like . i saw this on tap and though i have generally despised pumpkin beers so far , i figured i 'd give it a go since i 've never seen it on tap near my hometown . i 'm happy with my choice . i think if i were to go for another pumpkin beer in the future , i 'd go for this one ."

S"appearance : pours an inky , dark , caramel color with a dark tan head that does not stay around for long . smell : resiny hop aromas and a definite caramel background . taste : wow ! drinking this brew is like getting punched in the face by hops , malts and rye ! very sticky , resiny hop presence up front , backed by a very strong caramelly rye malt taste with the hop bitterness coming back at the end . like the bottle says , `` brewed with an obscene amount of malts & hops '' . m & d : thick ! they really pack in the ingredients here . while tasty , this beer is very difficult to drink , especially during the summer . this high-viscosity brew would be much better on a cold fall night ."

S"bomber , bottled on 3/9/10 , poured into a wheat beer glass ( reviewed in october ) . i 'm going to say this right off the bat , i did n't like this beer ... at all . considering the fact that i loved their hefeweizen and hefeweizen dark i am willing to give weihenstephaner the benefit of the doubt and believe i might have got a battle or old bottle . a : looks exactly like the hefeweissbier , dark golden color , hazy , massive 3-finger foamy head that lasts forever and leaves good lacing . s : right away i knew either something was wrong or this was n't for me . the banana and over-ripe fruit was just way to strong . it smelled like someone stuck a 2 week old black banana up my nose . i knew there were some other flavors and spices in there , but it just did n't come through . t : oh yeah , way to robust . i like bold flavored beers , but this just tastes like an old banana . i can taste some other fruits , bread , yeast , and esters when the initial burst mellows out , but it 's still really sweet and old tasting . m : i gave this a 4.0 because although i do n't like the taste , the mouth feel is pretty much the same as the hefes . d : i could n't finish this and ended up pouring out that last 1/3 of the glass . i really want to try a fresh bottle of this again because i love wweihenstephaner and it just did n't seem right ."

S"sweet , sticky bottle of `` meh . '' not worth $ 20/6 bottles . i hope you are n't scouring the earth for this one . extremely nice presentation , appearance , etc . no surprises , though , as this criteria has become par for the course ( imho ) among beers at this price range . got ta give it a 5.0 , but that seems to be commonplace at this price , and should not be weighted 20 % in the score . nose is very nice , like a bowl of zingers microwaved for 1 minute ( say , 2 chocolates , 1 yellow , and 1/2 raspberry ) . again , par for the course at this price . it did not get me high , so i give it a 4.5 . taste is pretty good ... imperial stout-ish ... add some honey and butterscotch the aforementioned bowl of zingers and we 're close . no coffee . also , this tastes a lot like alcohol . hopefully this needs to sit around for a while at 55 to mellow ( or i 'm just hypnotized by the post-hypnotic suggestion to `` cellar '' that 's printed on the bottle ) . feels like a thick , satin , high quality ( and alcohol ) beer . or , perhaps , feels like a nicely concentrated right-bank bordeaux . got ta give it a 5 . ( i 'm kinda binary so a 1-to-5 , graduated on the halves scale is hard for me to work with ) not especially drinkable . gets you drunk too quickly , and i had to spit to provide a reasonable reading . this is a fantastic novelty , but i wo n't be falling over myself to drink the remainder of my horde . likely trade-fodder ."

S"what an interesting beer . there is a lot going on here and it is very different than what a typical american beer drinker would expect out of something called a beer . pours and orange/brown color with a thin head that dissipates almost instantly . lots of bubbles , almost like a soda . no hops smell at all . has a herbal cirtrus smell and taste . a spicey bite follows the up front taste of fruit . reminds me a little of a true gingered ale just not quite as spicey . the carbonation does not let up as the bubbles never stop . a very complex and interesting brew that i would try again . i ca n't see drinking more than one at a time though ."

S"poured into a small tulip it forms an easily managed fizzy white head that falls to a solid cover . no lace . body is copper with a slight haze . smell like i was dropped off at a prune factory , except the prunes are in liquid form mixed with some medicine . quite medicinal to me and the drinkability and taste factor suffers . suggestions of chocolate deep in the backdrop never really become a factor . tart at times , more so in the smell but it creeps in when its cold and fades as it warmed . it shows some belgian strong dark ale characteristics but it has a near golden body ? whatever , i 'm not going to trip on mouse turds here its just not all that good no matter where we put it . notes : the taste was the best part of this offering which gives it a big boost but its just an ok brew at best . 12oz bottle picked up for curiosity and a chance at finding a gem . this is no gem , this is not a belgian strong dark ale and finally this is not worth another sampling ."

S"got this in a trade with mebuzzard early this year . thanks jason ! 12oz bottle topped with silver foil . brewed 9/25/03 , bottled 6/9/06 , label says 80ibu and 18.4 % abv . pours deep dark red , barely brown and slightly transparent . a strong swirl brings up a few bubbles that disappear again almost instantly . clings to the glass like wine or liquor . aroma is intense . lots of alcohol , but not hot . fruit - cherry , date , raisin . grape . caramel and toffee . the alcohol and fruit really make me think more of a mead or port than beer . bit of chocolate too - jay suggested chocolate covered raisins and i thought it fitted fairly well . taste is equally intense . lots of alcohol , but actually much less `` hot '' than i expected . it still hits you up front , but then mellows into a nice pleasant warmth . lots of fruit again . date , raisin , dried cherry . toffee . bit of caramel . dark chocolate . not quite as nice as the aroma . only a tiny hint of roast - certainly not to stout levels . biscuity malt . mouthfeel is nice . low carbonation level . medium body , but bigger than i thought it would be . drinkability is pretty good . definitely unbalanced towards the alcohol . and with less body and bitterness than i thought it would be . an interesting and complex beer that i definitely enjoyed , but not an imperial stout . maybe a barleywine , american strong ale , or even an old ale . no roast , colour is a bit light , thinner than expected . as a result it loses points for aroma , taste , and mouthfeel . still , well mellowed and very drinkable considering its size ."

S"appearance : golden yellow color . thick white head that occurred even with a careful pour . the head was persistent . way to go . smell : light belgian funk . slight bready aroma with some faint grapefruit aromas ( hops perhaps ) . smells like the standard mischief . taste : citrus fruits with the hops coming through fairly strong . i ca n't get any taste influence via the brett addition . i 'm sensitive to hops so i 'm wondering if the hop presence is muting any brett presence for me . mouth-feel : medium body with a spritz-y carbonation . overall : call this a belgian strong pale ale like the standard mischief and my ratings would go up quite a bit ( i like mischief and have gotten multiple growler fills in the past ) . but it 's labeled a wild ale so i 'm anticipating a sour or funky ale which i do n't get with this one . i loved the wild 57 that was served at the rs initiation party and was hoping this would be along the same vein . i really would like to get some standard mischief and compare it with this one ."

S"pours a dark , rusty red-brown colour , with only a slight film around the top of the glass . no lacing , but the body looks thick and heavy . some large bubbled carbonation which pours surprisingly quickly up the insides of the glass . not bad overall . light tannic bitter aromatics on the nose , with a bit of leather and grainy whiskey . little sweetness , the black-tea tannic notes are the most prominent . smells rather darker than it actually is . taste is redolent with booze notes , especially when aerated . big clunking notes of dark liquor , aniseed , and acetone with a tingling feel that ca n't entirely be put down to the carbonation . rather bitter in a clinging , chemical way . unfortunately , all the notes are confronting and harsh , with little to leaven or balance the palate . it 's a big and boisterous beer this one , but it feels too much so - there 's nothing lively or jubilant about it . it ends up sitting heavy , serious and rather depressingly unenjoyable ."

S"my first beer of this style . appearance : opaque brown body , slightly reddish coloration . small khaki-colored head that dissipates quickly . leaves a small amount of lacing . smell : sour , tarty aroma , a hint of that `` mustardy '' aroma i always get from lambics , has the aroma of a wild ale , probably due to the yeast . slightly musky at the bottom . this seems pretty much what i expected for-style , so i 'm giving it a 4 . taste : strong notes of sourness up front . breadiness in the middle , slightly malty and grainy . underneath the sourness is a mild touch of apples and cherry . finishes clean and dry with only a slight tart . mouthfeel : fairly thin mouthfeel , no real carbonation , slightly chewy . drinkability : i 'm dinging this a bit because i find it fairly undrinkable . i know the tartness and the sourness is to-style , but for my palate it 's fairly overwhelming . i 've given it credit in the higher categories , so i do n't feel bad for dropping its score a bit here ."

S"i would rate this brew as saranac 's version of orval . and a fairly successful one at that , too ! appearance - pours a dark orange with a short-lasting head that settles into a fine cap . a bit murky , looks really enticing . smell - a well-balanced aroma comes through , combining a pale and caramel malt bill with ( maybe ? ) some of candy sugar to thin the beer out a bit . taste -the flavor follows the aroma nicely . as with all successful abbey beers , this one has its viscocity balanced by the thinning effect of candy sugar . it 's hard to tell how closely the orval recipe is recreated here , but something tells me that the dry-hopping technique was omitted and all the bittering/flavoring hops were gotten in the boil . the yeast used is obviously somewhere in line with that used in the original ; the flavor profile is very close . is it fermented a second time with a different yeast ? i ca n't tell . mouthfeel - here again , the beer differs from the original : not as effervescent , but quite pleasant in its own right . drinkability - as with an original orval , the relatively low alcohol and mellow blending of flavor components make this an eminently drinkable brew.two , maybe even three ! a fine effort by saranac with this one ... : )"

S"i 've had this one quite a few times , but i have never reviewed it , well i have notes here from a tap version of this a 1996 keg , that i had a glass from at ludwigs in philly a few months ago . anyways , this is a dark cola brown brew with a fizzy khaki head . it is reminiscent of an eisbock in looks , but the aroma is much more deep , imho . very complex with a huge maltiness as well as maple flavors , and maybe a hint of coffee , and dessert as well . dark fruits and nuts also slip into the olfactory senses . taste is doughy and malty with not much of an alcoholic feel except for a slight `` port-like '' tinge of booze at the finish . mouthfeel is thick and viscous and the drinkability is good , but not excellent unless you are freakin ' insane . a lovely tipple , aged keg seems similar to aged bottles , but super fresh this one is not too good . give it at least 1 year ... if not more ."

S"12 oz brown bottle . no sign of a date . it pours slightly dark for th style , it is an orangeish/reddish/copperish brown with golden highlights . the head is large and off-white , it is frothy and takes a while to recede leaving some decent lacing . the smell is caramally , boozy , and pretty hoppy as well . it has a bit of citrus and pine in there that smells candied with the sweetness this beer carries in the smell . the taste is a bit weak for a dipa . it has lots of grain and malt flavors , a hit of caramel and some smooth nicely flavored hops that do n't provide much bitterness over the top of all that . my main qualm is that it is a bit watery . it is merely okay , one of the lesser dipas in wisconsin . very drinkable though , if you want a summer dipa that you can just suck down on a hot day this would work ."

S"slowly becoming a fan of dogfish head , and it should be no surprise considering the great suds they 've been producing as of late ... so this is one that i had to try simply because of the word of mouth i 've been hearing ... such a strong one and so expensive ( $ 11 at my local beer store ) ! ! ! it was recommended to me by the bierkraft associate that i pour this one into a port glass ... and how right he was . like the midnight sky with a new moon , this beer is pitch black and completely opaque , with a thin and fine veil of a head that quickly disappears entirely ... such mystery ! the smell is warm and inviting , almost like a hard liqours ' , with scents of malt and a little chocolate , although im not sure ... this type of brew is new to me . one sip knocked me into a seat and blew me away . strong taste , wtih heavy alcoholic bite . very malty , with chocolate and coffee undertones . it is pleasant to drink with meats and cheese , but in small amounts . had to split the bottle with a friend . could have drank the whole thing myself , but my low tolerance would have found my drunk afterward . the aftertaste is not as bitter as i would expect , but rather bittersweet , again like chocolate . i imagine this being preferable during cold winter nights or rainy days ... not an everyday brew ."

S"this caught my eye as i entered tw as a great price on a sixer of dubbels ! let 's give it whirl and see if it pans out . popping the top i get that great belgian smell of yeast , spices , some brown sugar and cinnamon . pours into a chalice to a hearty translucent brown with a wispy head . taste is also classic belgian with an up front sweetness from the double malts and a tartiness in the middle as the carbonation and hops take over the sweetness . finish is mildly bitter and clean . this is an easy drinker and the 7.3 % abv is barely noticeable except for attributing to a silky smooth mouthfeel . this is a good brew and a great value ."

S'gorgeous golden amber colour with a fair head . smell i found to be a little metallic , but in a good way , with some herbiness aswell . taste is great . very herby , tempered by some butteriness and a fairly strong alcohol flavour . mouthfeel is quite abrasive , probably due to the carbonation and the peppery taste . it is never overpowering though . i find this a very slow beer to drink , owing to the intense flavours and aforementioned carbonation . i was pleasantly surprised to find this beer in my local supermarket , where the next best beer is probably guiness in cans . maybe someone must have made a mistake when they were ordering the beer . if so i will take advantage of it while it lasts .'

S'this beer was perhaps the most disappointing one on tap when i visited two rows . especially because the pub had 4 beers to appeal to the light beer drinking crowd , and only one darker beer to showcase more complex flavors . at a brewpub , i think it should be the other way around . this beer tasted pretty much as if they had picked out the darkest grains available and brewed up a quick beer . in otherwords , it tasted pretty much like my early homebrewed attempts at stout . the results are usually drinkable , but very unspectacular . this was just an overly roasty , ho hum dark beer .'

S'pours black with a mocha moderately sized head , that looks really creamy . first thing that strikes me when smelling the beer is the really appealing combination with rosted malts ( coffee , cocoa ) and fruity american hops , and some fruity eyast esters , really apealing . reminds me alot of dark hops from beer here ! the rather agressive american hops are present in the form of grapefruit and a light piny-ness , and they combine very well with roasted malt flavours , in particular with a fruity kind of coffee flavour , really nice . a very noticeable note of toffee awakens as the brew warms up as well . the taste is really well balanced throughout , and a lingering bitterness in the back makes itself very known at the end with a finishing bite . creamy and at the same time light mouthfeel , with a very well fitting carbonation , small and soft bubbles .'

S"from notes : i heated this up as per the instructions to the recommended 120 degrees . pours a dark chocolate brown , almost black color with a thin chestnut brown ring . slightly roasted aroma with lots of spice , alcohol and dark berries . hints of pepper , clove and anise as well as some plum , raisin and grape . full bodied , thick and syrupy with a very prominent spice character along with hints of dark berries and astringent alcohol . there is some subtle citrus complimenting the dark fruit notes . hints of currant , plum and raisin as well as a very prominent anise flavor that overpowers the rest of the beer . although the beer is only 7.5 % , the alcohol presence is strong and off putting . i 'm not sure what this beer tastes like cold but heating it up seems more like a novelty than anything else . it tastes mostly like an alcoholic herbal tea . i was intrigued by the idea but it did n't really work ."

S'a- this beer is golden yellow , very clear , with a huge amount of carbonation . there is a nice , albeit fizzy , head . s- the smell is a bit yeasty , nondistinct sweetness , with a slight skunkiness . t- very light bodied malty sweetness and a small mettallic tinge . m- mouthfeel is fairly thick for a macro and very fizzy . d- this beer , while not amazingly complex , is one of my favorite session beers . its very light and easy to drink , while having an excellent taste that keeps me from being bored after drinking a few .'

S'a dark brown with a tan head . considering the abv not bad . smell is solvent and chicory coffee . a sweet alcohol edge and a cornucopia of dark fruits . somewhat medicinal . thick roasted grains and a touch of molasses . taste is full of wood with oak in particular . more of the roasted grains and molasses . vanilla and almond extract . alcohol is present but well done . it folds itself into the profile nicely . finish is mildly hopped with a touch of iodine and alcohol . feel is thick and syrupy with just enough carbonation to lend a touch of creaminess to the consistency to break it up . this is a sipper . you know right away that this beer packs a punch and you respect it or fall on your face . still you keep picking the glass up to imbibe again . wow . this is a mild brute of a beer . i will have to cellar a few of these .'

S"beer review from ba mag aug 2007 . here we have o'fallon 's famous smoked porter , brewed with over 60 percent smoked german malts , dropped into whiskey barrels and allowed to mature and worm its way through all that charred american oak . oh , yeah . pitch-black , opaque and topped with a creamy coffee-colored head that drops to thin , large-bubbled ringed lace . massive whiskey nose , a bit boozy ; rich vanilla , some smoked meats , charred wood and ash . round and smooth , a bit silky ; lighter on the palate than anticipated . sweet up front , with a touch of molasses , brown sugar , chocolate and coffee . semi-sour , but not in a bad way ; oaky flavor breaks through with a soft herbal hop note . deep whiskey flavors throughout the beer , with vanilla and spicy alcohol . smoky toward the finish , with more wood . finishes surprisingly dry and clean , with some light whiskey residuals and a husky edge . though the smokiness has been dulled down a bit by aging the beer in wood , it 's still very present and blends extremely well with the whiskey characteristics that it picked up , which are themselves not at all overpowering , but rather quite complementary . an incredibly complex and enjoyable brew -- big thumbs-up to o'fallon . great on its own , as a digestif or paired with some chocolates ."

S'750ml corked and caged bottle . i had some difficulty getting the smaller than average sized cork out . drank from my duvel tulip . a- this one pours out a a very dark but ruby red colored body with lighter highlights around the edges of the glass . a rather large khaki colored head forms on top and takes its time falling . lots of even lacing gets left behind on the sides of my glass . off to a nice start . s- my initial whiff brings forth lots of bourbon and fusel alcohol . after that i get a lot of plums , cherries , and some raisins . sweet caramel and toffee malts show up next . a little bit of vanilla from the oak barrel is subtle , but still noticeable . t- the first sip brings back those sweet caramel and toffee malts that i could smell . after that i get some bourbon and plenty of fusel alcohol . some fruits , mostly plum and cherries but also some raisins . a little bit of vanilla/barrel . some citrus ( grapefruit ) and piny hops finish this one off . m- full bodied and syrupy . palate coating with a lingering aftertaste and plenty of heat from the alcohol . d- this bottle seemed a little big for me . i wish i had waited for someone to open it with . id like to revisit this one when it gets some age on it , i picked it up shortly after it arrived around here .'

S"i have n't reviewed a beer in many years , but this one had a profound impact on my taste buds and my stomach . i stopped by eli cannons for an after work beverage and ordered up one of these gnarly concoctions after reviewing a fairly weak beer list for eli 's . this thing poured a deep , dark chocolate with hints of mahogany . head was nonexistent . the smell was predominantly chocolate with a mild hint of coffee . the first sip hit me with a wave of chocolate and even more chocolately sweetness followed by a strong alcohol burn in the stomach . i proceeded to sip this concoction with each sip becoming more difficult than the last . i love chocolate , but the cloying sweetness and lack of complexity and complimentary flavors made this thing unbearable . i could n't handle it anymore , i had reached that dreaded point in every dedicated beer drinkers life . that point of conflict which burdens our soul to the core , but i had no other decision . i asked the bartender to take the remaining 1/2 glass away and do the ever so feared drain pour . seriously , i 've had over 500 different beers in my life and this one was absolutely disgusting . ok , i will keep my door open to this beer , but only under 1 condition . i would try this again if it was paired up with a proper meal that ( gag ) may actually compliment this hideous creation ."

S"750 ml into a goblet/ bottled on april 22 , 2009 p : orange-tinged amber with a gargantuan head of tan foam . it sits atop with the puffiness of a cumulus cloud and has a pretty thick and frothy texture to it . shows good retention and even better rockiness as it sinks and leaves some chunks of lace behind . a : the nose is quite interesting . i get citrus and floral hops , caramel malts , some fruity notes , and that brett-derived horse blanket , leathery kind of character . much more funky than i would have thought for being bottled only four months ago . t : the taste is equally interesting , but in a less pleasant way than the nose . citrus hops hit me with flavors of grapefruit , orange , and lemons while a pinch of pine needles jab at the bitter region of my palate . some earthiness is noted in here as well . the caramel malt is heavily-toasted and plays a more sizeable role than the nose would lead you to believe . but , i think the brett funk just kind of muddles things up a bit for me . it seems a little too forceful with notes of hay , horse blanket , and sweaty leather which kind of trample on the rest of the flavor profile . m : the mouthfeel of wild devil is easily its best attribute . it feels medium-full in the mouth with a rich , semi-sticky creaminess that makes it very palatable , even if it is a bit over-carbonated . notes : i had a hard time rating this beer due to the unique nature of it . i just was n't really feeling the brett'ed ipa idea . admittedly , it sounds interesting on paper , but the actual execution of such a beer was really awkward and not all that pleasant . the funk seems to drown out the hops and makes it feel kind of disjointed as a whole . props to victory for being brave enough to try it , though . it seems like a lot of other people are digging it , but it just was n't my cup of tea . interesting to say the least ."

S"visual sensation : a lucid honey hue even throughout . minimal head/lacing . looks tasty on a hot day , but not much to distinguish it , aside from the golden clarity . midas indeed . nasal sensation : a little bit of sweetness ( honey ) and a touch of spice ( saffron , apparently ) . a touch of grain . very subtle . oral sensation : woah . burst of spice , honey and barley up front , a splash of carbonation , mellowing to a very nice toasted barley/oat that rides off into the sunset . the white grapes add tang and give it vague wine characteristics , which i think are pretty cool . feel of the mouth : nicely balanced -- the sweetness of the honey gets a bit heavier as you drink through , but the spice and perfect amount of carbonation carries it well , for the most part . imbibability : a tasty beer , but the sweetness gets a bit thick near the end of the bottle , to the point that it 's trying ."

S'great looking black pour with a deep brown head . upon first smell , i am greeted by a distinct wood and bourbon aroma . the usual chocolate and vanilla notes have arisen . i think i am getting buzzed just sticking my nose in this . is that possible ? the taste is not quite at the level of the smell , mainly because the wood dominates a bit too much over the underlying flavors . nonetheless , this is still quite a tasty treat . not very hot at all which is surprising based on the other reviews . perhaps i am just used to it by now . i wish the chocolate came through a bit more , but really i am nitpicking . this is a high quality stout , not necessarily a standout among other barrel aged monsters though . mouthfeel is medium to medium-full , a bit too much prickle in the carbonation in my opinion . drinkability is rather low simply because of the harsh woodiness . 8 oz . would make a good nightcap , too bad the bomber is 26 . share this .'

S"i have been waiting to review this for quite some time , quite possibly my favorite pumpkin beer in existence . this is a real treat , and my friends introduced it to me on tap in a goblet last year . i am reviewing a 22 oz bottle poured into a belgian snifter . a - this pours a bright orange . it is perhaps the most orange beer i have ever seen . very clear but vibrant color . you know you are in for something unique already . the head disappears quickly but in this case that 's a good thing . this is how a pumpkin ale should look like . s - i agree this is perhaps the best smelling pumpkin beer there is . wow . rich and spicy . smells more like a baked pumpkin pie than beer ! smells more bready than other pumpkin ales , and not just full of spice . t - wow . sweetness up front followed by spice and pumpkin . the lasting flavor is of pumpkin pie and buttery crust . i do n't know how they infuse a crust taste into this beer but it 's like drinking liquid pumpkin pie ! i get some notes of vanilla in the aftertaste as well as even more pumpkin ! at the end i get a slight hoppiness . my only complaint is that you can really taste the booze about halfway through , but the other tastes are just sensational . such a treat in the fall . m - creamy and thick , it almost feels spicy to your mouth . d - this beer is meant to be savored , i suggest pouring it and noting how the flavor changes as the beer comes to room temperature , as is my approach to rich stouts . a bomber usually satisfies me quite well . i am asking the store to order me a case of this one so i can have one on special occasions over the holidays , i like it that much . if you see this one please please please give it a try after a good fall meal , it is truly outstanding . each sip leaves me wanting more . this beer is so good and it is sad that it only comes once a year . another amazing big beer from southern tier !"

S"pretty interesting beer as it 's a cross between a `` normal '' porter and a rye brew . it 's actually their lightest brew and apparently gets its color from the rye as much as the use of roasted malts . looks a bit like a brown ale . hazy walnut color with a white head . the flavor profile has notes of roasted malts , but they 're not as potent as you 'd typically expect . there 's a hint of cocoa-like sweetness , but the finish is fairly dry . the rye adds a hint of peppery spice , but it 's hidden . texture is silky and this beer is about as easy drinking as they come . an excellent beer that crosses style guidelines of all kinds . i called it a rye beer , but in reality you could call it a porter or maybe even a brown ale , too . i can imagine this beer being a flagship in the future ."

S"appearance : pitch black with a creamy brown head . moderate lacing . smell : very strong malt aroma , with toffee , coffee , and a prominent yeast bite . taste : this was a cask-conditioned ale , served at cellar temperatures . it was cool , but not chilled . and it was fantastic . definitely one of the more complex brews i 've had . the initial run up was all malt , like moretti la rossa or mackeson 's stout . some strong banana-strawberry notes came out halfway through , along with a very savory sort of `` steak juice '' flavor . the finale brought out some strong espresso notes , along with the yeast bite familiar to all homebrewers . i 'm not sure of the abv , but it hit me noticably after only one . and i 'm a fat guy with lots of drinking experience . on the other hand , i was drinking on a very empty stomach . so who knows ? i did get a noticable alcohol tang on the finish , but it was nicely balanced with everything else that was going on . mouthfeel : velvety and smooth . like buttah ! full bodied , and not very carbonated . drinkability : as with so many other worthy beers , this beer was not drinkable in the sense of `` pounding one down '' or `` dropping three or four in an hour . '' it 's a rich , filling brew , and it 'll put you on your ass . overall : this was my very first cask-conditioned ale . i do n't know if they 're all as fabulously complex as this beer , but this was a fantastic first shot . highly recommended ."

'' ) . 13 rebels fairly rolls down my throat & leaves my yearning for another sip , right away . very , very good beer ! i can see how this would not appeal to everyone , it 's unique & quite a bit off the beaten path . i 'll be sad to see this glass go , & it 's moving off at quite a pace ."

S"now listening to ... clocks ticking , fans blowing and toilets flushing 2010 batch from bottle into a large widemouth scotch glass . a - jet black body , so meets expectations there . head was about a nice single finger of dark rust . s - aromas were much tamer than expected , but pleasant . vanilla , coffee and bourbon , but only a hint of actual booze . t - here is where kbs gets its reputation . this is a perfect blend that is only slightly high on the vanilla for my taste . otherwise ... bourbon , coffee , roasted malts , chicory , oak , chocolate and the booze in the taste compliments such bold flavors . m - i was surprised that this was not actually thicker than it is . do n't get me wrong , this is thick enough to hold up , but the whole breakfast stout aspect gave me the impression that it would be meatier . but having said that , i was completely happy with the mouthfeel and level of carbonation . d - ok , i am sure this is where my rdev is going to dip , but i think that anybody who rates the drinkability of an 11+ % beer in the 4+ range is out of their mind . this is a very strong beer and after just one , i was feeling every point of that abv . it is also rich like cheesecake and i could n't just sit around eating piece after piece of cheesecake . it took me close to an hour to drink a 12 ounce bottle . enjoyable - yes , drinkable - 3 ."

S'sierra pale ale : good looking beer , cloudy caramel , had a big white head that disappeared in a few minutes . wonderful aroma , sweet , with a little hoppiness . hits the tongue with a little sweetness , and then a nice bitter hop bite . several sips later , it seems the hops dominate . i can tell this is a fine beer , but the bitterness is a touch to much for me .'

S"bottle thanks to jjpm74 a burnt orange with hardly any head , even after a fierce pour . tiny bubbles on top of the liquid are few and far between . sweet malt and caramel with some apple notes . super sweet malt with some spiciness that finishes rather quickly . some bitter hops but this is all about the malt . i dunno this is n't really my kind of beer . a bit sticky , like watered down maple syrup . shew , had trouble finishing this one , in fact i gave the rest to my girlfriend who apparently loves it ."

S"dark brown clear body with ruby highlights . smells like band-aids , nothing else . highly phenolic , obviously contaminated . the only time i 've ever give a beer a 1 . ditto for the taste . i took one more swing to give mouthfeel a chance . it 's over-carbonated , but all right . terrible beer . i do n't know what happened , but it 's obviously contaminated . avoid at all costs . i 'm drinking a busch light someone left in my fridge to get the taste out of my mouth ."

S"during the pour , the head effervesces rapidly from large bubbles , lingers a bit , and then disappears nearly completely . the color is an opaque straw with a small flowery smell . the taste starts out with a thin feel and a little flavor ; there 's some honey-like sweetness with some maltiness . after a bit of time the high alcohol content is apparent . there 's a slight hoppy finish that does n't leave anything behind . it 's a thin drink with almost no aftertaste ; overall light and refreshing . nothing about the flavor is overpowering ; it has a good balance ."

S"batch 9740 . 12 oz bottle poured into a snifter . a : dark golden color with a nice 1 finger off white head that has excellent retention and lacing . overall , a very nice looking beer . s : lots of citrusy hops dominate the smell . not much in the way of pine or acidity on the nose . lemons , grapefruit , and a little watermelon are the dominant smells . the aroma is not overwhelming but is quite pleasant and balanced . t : i feel like this has all the characteristics of a top tier beer , just that the flavor and smell are not quite as intense as the top level beers of this class . the flavor , while not quite as intense as say a pliny or sculpin is still spot on . two hearted has a wonderful balance of slightly sweeter citrusy hops at the start and a bitter kick at the finish . somewhat like abrasive . m : perfect level of carbonation . nice viscosity and a great aftertaste . d : i think i could drink this all day . it is a crisp , balanced , tasty beer . the alcohol is not noticeable at all . if you have n't tried this one you definitely should , and it should n't be too hard to find ."

S"after a hard day of work i decided to raid the my dads cooler in his boat for an icy cold one . i was expecting busch or miller lite or high life but to my surprise i found glass longnecks . i was puzzled but i grabbed one and my favorite beer glass to give this a try . this is my first leinenkugel product to try appearance : lemony yellow ( duh ) i poured vigorously and got a decent head but it quickly faded into a slick on the top . not much lacing but i was n't expecting it to have much . smell : lemon and more lemon . i got a slight smell of some thing wheaty but not much taste : tastes like beer flavored lemonade . not much of a beer taste in there . it is refreshing though so it has that in its favor . mouthfeel : not much there , it is kind of foamy but does n't feel like i am drinking a beer . it is n't an offensive feel but it is not on par with what i call beer . drinkability : it is smooth for sure . i am sure on a hot day when i do n't want to drink one of my heavy imports i might reach for one of these , unless i am craving a beer then i will grab a beer . just kidding it is ok but i would n't drink it around my buddies . my gf might like it though . overall it is not an offensive drink . it is still refreshing and tasty but it does n't give me the feeling of beer . i am pretty impressed with this company for doing something a little differerent . i am never a fan of flavored beer myself but out of all the ones i have tried this is probably the best one ."

S"a light lager from steelback , probably there best beer i have ever had , far superior to the chain . this is similar to chain in colouration , since obviously , if you look at the box and the labelling on the bottles , they are very similar . and similar in aftertaste . poured a very light yellow , with little head , but what can you expect from a lower-quality light beer ? lacing was very quick , but longer than the chain or the steelback silver . right off the bat , you can smell the metal conditioning cylinders . almost as if you 're in the brewery . other than the metallic smell , it is much better than coors light , of which i will take this brew over any day . taste is lacking , since there is very little taste to speak of , but still , there is some flavouring of the hops ( obviously cascade and/or czech ) . mouthfeel is excellent for a light beer , and drinkability is very good , since i could easily have a few of these before moving on to something better to finish off the evening . you can also load yourself crazy with this , since its also really cheap to buy down the street at the beer store ."

S"appearance - slightly hazy , a reddish-orange hue . a moderate cap of creamy foam . solid sheets of lace as it reduces to a thin complete cover . aroma - a grassy , piny hop aroma . after the initial pour , much of that fades , allowing a crackery grain smell to peek through . the remaining hop presence is fairly well-balanced but still a little light for the style . taste - brief biscuity grain , a touch of diacetyl . the hops are pretty one-dimensional , grapefruit rind . not much depth but they hold their own . a touch medicinal on the finish , not overboard though . mouthfeel - some creamy smoothnes , well-carbonated . drinkability - a little bent to the harsh , bitter side . the flavor is decent but not one i 'd pass around ."

S"picked up a case at the brewery in campbellford - i recommend visiting the brewery ! i poured one into a glass after drinking one from the bottle , and it was darker than i expected , a dark gold-amber with a small fluffy head . serious hops smell , with a whole lot of pine , some fruitiness , alcohol , almost a gin smell i 'd say . a big kick of hops dominates the taste , leaving little room for anything else , which i suppose was their intention . the malt comes through with some citrus , grapefruit notes , but everything gets knocked aside when the big bitter hops hit you . long-lasting bitterly clean finish , again with the pine taste . not exactly well-balanced , but hey , that 's the style . nice smooth mouthfeel , with active , buzzing carbonation to try to keep up with the hoppiness . drinkable for the beer geeks like us , but the average joe might prefer something more neutral . note : ba lists this as 6.5 % , but my bottle says 5 % - not sure which one to believe"

S'picked up during my recent belgium trip . as we had arrived early for our scheduled tour of the brasserie caulier , we decided to tromp around the town of pruwelz . i picked this offering up in a small beer store called le brassin . presentation : 12 ounce brown glass bottle . the label has a red border which encompasses a skyline picture of tournai , recognizable due to the monstrous cathdrale notre-dame on the left of the label . listed as lumire dhiver bire de saison brune du tournaisis . the image and significance of a fancy red , yellow and blue shield at the side of the wording abbaye de abdij saint-martin , is somewhat ruined , and the mystery solved , by the fact that the contract brewer is clearly stated as being brasserie brunehaut in the top right hand corner of the label . it also states that this is 8 % by volume . clearly this is a contract brew . appearance : muddy tawny brown with some oak and chestnut hints that has some ruby flashes when backlit . lovely tan colored smooth clinging head that laces extremely well . fine beaded carbonation . nose : deep sweet caramel nose with lots of sticky devon toffee and thick yeasty odors . the alcohol is evident when deeply inhaled . taste : lots of caramel and thick chewy malts , heavy yeast flavors , light spices and a sweet finish with the merest hint of orange rind . toffee flavors cling to the cheeks and tongue once swallowed , which makes way for a spicy tingle . this has a tasty complex finish long after the beer has been swallowed . mouthfeel : solid performance in this department . warming malty alcohols with a thick chewy character that fills the mouth and warms the stomach once swallowed . drinkability : the 33cl i had was more than enough , quite sickly after a while if i am honest . this is more of sipping beer as the winter ( hiver ) name does indeed suggest . nice for a cold night though . overall : strange but quite intriguing but not one that would entice me to part with my hard exchanged dollars for euros again .'

S"a beautiful looking beer . pours at cloudy golden color with a huge thick creamy off-white head . there is a milky-white cloudiness to this beer that is oddly appealing . the head does not stop and leaves tons of sticky lace behind . wow , some serious big american hop aroma . loads of citrus and pine with a definate acidic character . very faint wheat-beer character , some yeastiness and spice , thought the spice may be from the hops . the hops just completely take over the aroma , possibly due to the soft and subtle nature of wheat . they are raw - like opening a fresh package of hops before brewing . unbalanced and slightly off-putting . and that huge hop aroma can barely be found in the flavor . lots of yeastiness , tons of banana , clove , and bubblegum . mild floral and citrus hop flavors . not much depth and fairly one dimesional - wheat and banana . alcohol brings a little heat . i am not really into this beer . decent mouthfeel , soft but a little thin and overly carbonated . i had enough after a few sips . the fall off from super hoppy aroma to one-note wheat flavor just did n't work for me . i 'm not going to bash this beer just because i did n't like it , it 's just not my cup of tea ( or mug of beer ) . i just hope the schneider better suits my tastes ."

S"ah , behold wild blue blueberry lager i do n't really know what i was expecting with this beer . i saw it sitting there on the shelf , and it looked different , and it looked exciting . one of my friends from boston told me that up north they 'll sometimes serve lagers with blueberries in the glass . so this was probably something like that , right ? well , mostly wrong . but i did n't think it was absolutely terrible . do n't get me wrong , i took my first sip and made a bit of an awkward face . i just on ba really fast to get the consensus , and i think all the awful ratings started to sway me . but i got ahold of myself and really tried to figure this one out . it is n't very hoppy or malty , or anything like beer really . but it faintly resembles one . i do n't think it is quite as bad as a blueberry-flavored malt liquor . but it ai n't that much better . the color 's about what i 'd expect : pinkish-purple . not the most appetizing thing to look at , but whatever . i think the main thought that turned me off with this beer was whether or not all this flavoring was artificial . the front claims that it has `` natural flavors and color from fruit juice . '' that ca n't be all though . just too sugary . a `` bitch beer , '' if you will . my girlfriend would love this stuff . and while i , too , can appreciate an 8 % alc/vol rating , i just do n't dig this stuff that much ."

( ? ) a : an aggressive pour shows off a nice , brassy/copper , but as it rests in my glass , it 's a clear , dark amber goodness . world-class , sticky lacing running all the way up the side of my sippie cup with an attractive vanilla colored head ( kidding , wanting to see if you were really reading this one ) . this baby is a thing of beauty to look at.. s : i got lots of citrus and dry pine aromas trailed by mildly caramelized malts . the aromas are rich and too the point on this one . t : without reading reviews , i 'm guessing a lot of cascade hops were used in the creation of this one . i can taste the rich , strong alcohol pretty easily , as well - definitely a strong ale here . relatively simple tasting of rich hops , lightly roasted malts and alcohol . m : medium bodied with ample carbonation . a real treat to finish off the night . this is by no means sessionable , but rather a nice , occasional treat . thanks to the abv , it wo n't be hard to fall asleep after this one ."

S"had on-tap at barley 's in asheville dirty , cloudy orange in the glass . looks darker on the inside and lighter on the outside . nice sticky finger sized head that last forever . this head is so sticky that i do n't see how they can wash it off . heavy lacing that covers the entire glass . hops in the nose . also , mixed fruits , kinda like a tropicana twister . this brew is a hop bomb . does have a nice sweet , grapefruit like finish , to add some complexity . feels sticky , crisp and bitter in the mouth . the hoppiness hurts the drinkability some . my first offering from pisgah and an excellent offering it was . i look forward to trying some more of there brews ."

S"reviews are from three bottles over two weeks , consistent impressions . pours reddish-orange , clear , nice carbonation , nice fizzy lightly beige head that settles down to a proofing-bread-yeast cap . mells of sweet fruit and of hops , mostly on the citrusy side -- esp . once the head leaves . the taste is a tale of two beers . when fairly cool , good balance between mildly sweet malts with fruit notes and hop bitterness and taste -- some pine , mostly citrus . as it warms ( though still _well_ below room temp ) , hop flavor becomes more pronounced and out of balance . the sweet fruit and citrus hop components separate as well . cool or warm , mouthfeel is fine , medium bodied , ca n't really say it helps/hurts/pushes the flavor . i 've drank about 10 oz . from each bottle . taste is a 4 when chilled , 2 when warmed to my typical ipa temp . ( around 50 degrees ) i should note this is the second beer i 've had recently that drank better cold then at so-called `` appropriate '' temp . ranges . the first ( gl blackout stout ) specifically called for low temps. , and it worked wonders . i wonder if sn assumed the bulk of folks drinking this would do so straight from the fridge , and planned accordingly . under the best of circumstances , however , i would n't be able to finish one before it warmed up to `` yuck '' temps ."

S"hazy caramel color with a finely bubbled head that rises up quickly , and settles down to a half inch head that extends thick fingers up to the rim of the glass . aroma is doughey and yeasty , with nuances of ripe fruits , caramel , and banana . flavor is rich and yeasty upfront , and morphs quickly into ripe banana and grainy brown sugar . some pepperiness and clove emerges in the finish , again coupled with banana and some marshmallow . a yeasty flavor lingers in the aftertaste , and is quickly punctuated by the bitter , tangy flavor of overripe banana . mouthfeel 's a little overly carbonated , too tingly . not very drinkable for my tastes due to the yeastiness and predominating banana flavor ."

S"i stopped by the beer store attached to the restaurant ( great deal , too : $ 12+deposit for 2l ) and saw one last lonely growler of this limited-edition brew in the fridge . i asked about it , and he said this might be the last growler of landlord 's daughter in existence , as they might be retiring the beer . like any good advocate of beer , i had to have it . he warned me that it was exceptionally smokey , and i did n't believe him until cracking it open . pours a thick , viscous black , like motor oil : almost completely opaque to the bare eye , with barely a glimmer of brown around the edges . coming out of a growler i missed out on any head , but the bubbly film on top gives it even more of an intimidating , oily appearance . the smell is smokey all the way , with very strong coffee notes . charcoal , chocolate , a lot of bitter smells , but very well balanced . the taste ... whoa , big punch of smoke up front ( he warned me ) but surprisingly that melts away into a blend of coffee , cloves , bitterness , and a sweet sugary note trying to fights its way to the top amid all of the smokey chaos . after that first surprising punch of flavour , you can really start to flesh out all of the different tastes , with the almost marshmallowy sweetness being the lingering aftertaste . smells like a campfire , tastes like coffee and roasted marshmallow ... should 've taken this one camping . mouthfeel is unfortunately thin and unremarkable , not sure if that 's the growler 's fault . definitely tasty , but one beer filled me up with enough smoke flavour to not want another for a little while ."

S'the beer poured clear amber brown with a tan head that was large and in charge . ( the beer opened with a huge carbonation burst . ) the aroma was earthy with a slight farmhouse character . also present was a slight citrus aroma . the flavor was crisp and tart with an earthy hop bittering and flavor and a light citrus note . the bittering was substantial and well done to keep the flavor in check . also a slight oak character existed in the background . the finish was dry with a lingering citrus and earthy bittering long into the aftertaste . the body was medium but seemed lighter due to carbonation . 750 ml bottle . the beer was nice , nothing to write home about , but well bittered and with a decent drinkability . the citrus note makes me wonder if orange peel was involved .'

S'crummers pours almost clear , reddish amber , with a modest almond head in a tulip glass . the head fades quickly to a thin lace . surprisingly light notes of bread are followed by hay , orange , and subtle , sweet-cut grass and coriander . the mild flavors lack complexity , but tend to be sweet and balanced . the light body and soft carbonation of this beer make no room for alcohol , although it is a bit dry . while j. g. crummers may lack complexity , but it is clearly high on my list of session beers while kicking back with friends . date consumed : 14 august 2008'

S"found this in a 6-pack . not sure if this is from the original 100-barrel run or if they 've released a second run and put it 12oz'ers rather than bombers . a : small ( 1/4 '' ) creamy-white head , fades to a ring of bubbles . surprisingly good lacing , however . pale , a light yellow/orange color . this seems a little lighter than i like my barleywines to be . s : i could smell this one on the pour , from a reasonable distance . perhaps it needs to mellow out more with age ( this is the first of the 6 bottles ) . aroma is strong citrus , notes of pineapple . there is also a pungent quality vaguely reminiscent of a strong cheese . odd ... i hope that does n't carry through in the flavor . t : the strong aromas translate directly into taste . i 'm still getting that vague pungent overtone , but it fades quickly , transitioning into citrusy bitterness , and finishing with a malty , boozy kicker . honestly , that first bite is still hurting me . m : for the lack of carbonation that appeared in the head after what was a reasonably vigorous pour , there 's a surprising amount of residual carbonation for a barleywine . it 's not overwhelming , but it 's noticeable . d : i love me the barleywine style , but this is one that will have to age out longer to prove itself to me . maybe there 's something wrong with this one bottle , or maybe it 's just still young and brash . but until it mellows out , this is n't terribly drinkable ."

S"review number 200 ! decided to open something special . a - black as can be with what started as a monster tan head that has died down a bit but still lingers s - big roasted aroma 's mingle with notes of vanilla . a big wiff of smoke fills my nostrils as well . a hint of sweetness lies in there but mostly roast and smoke . this is just what i look for . t - follows the aroma . mostly smoke and roast in this . however not as much as the aroma would suggest . some chocolate and coffee but it really plays a minor part . finishes with more smoke/tobacco notes . m - this part really kills this beer . the body is way too thin . light to medium bodied with a low amount of carbonation . d - a solid brew and one that i enjoy . goes down real easy . nice roasted notes but not as much as some other ris 's . really needs a thicker body . if you like smokey stouts you would enjoy this one . i 'll certainly pick this up any chance i can get but it is n't as great as i was hoping for ."

S'a : a walnut brown with red rose shades at its margins . head is tan and single finger depth that vanishes rapidly with only a thin ring left to remind you of its existence . still and clear . s : a malt sweetness unique to dark munich with its melanoidins and a slight sherry aroma . toasted nut combined with nutmeg and cinnamon spices . hops and yeast give a fruity and floral scent . the aroma profile sounds magnificent , however most of these flavors are faint . t : a toasted nut and bread dough sweetness briefly greets the palate . then hello hops bitterness arriving way to early with a mineral flavor that clears the sweetness but does not last long either . a slightly salty taste in the pharynx and a spicy heat in the stomach finishes the tasting . m : to be brief , too thin , too still , and too little head retention . d : i got really excited about this beer when i picked it up . i got even more excited when i learned it was similar to a dubbel . unfortunately , this beer does not approach the level of richness , complexity , and class of a dubbel . big deductions for mislabeling this one . in all , i have enjoyed many smuttynose beers , but this is certainly one exception .'

S'i poured this authentic ris into a shaker pint . appearance- this one is a looker . great three and a half - finger tootise roll colored head is quite magnificent . so many pock marks dapple the cap and are accompanied by tiny bubbles . and of course , the retention is great , with big , random flecks of chunky lace . the body ? pitch black . smell- how incredibly unbalanced is this one ! the list includes : red wine , roasted malt , wood chips , some dark fruit , and soy sauce . all of these flavors mixing together create some rather unpleasant scents . taste- unfortunately this stout is not much better here . i get a definite feel of leather and some more red wine to lead off the drink . a nice touch that went far too quickly was some dark cherry tang . roasted malt is also doing some good things here , but it takes forever to pick it out after adjusting to the weird flavors . the finish is strong with some fresh mint and soy sauce . wow . wow not in a good way . mouth feel- the feel is good . technically , this beer is fine . this one is pretty flat and slick , but for how long this was aged , i was expecting that . and the body is bordering on full . overall- well , it is not terrible . but how incredibly strange can an ris get ? the smells and flavors are all over the place , and maybe parts of them worked , but as a whole it is mostly a mess . honestly , for how much a bottle of this was , i could never justify picking it up again .'

S"pours a thick off-white head that thins pretty quickly , sitting on top of a coppery/bronze/sunset color that has total clarity . light brown sugar in the nose , fruits like pomegranate and mango , and that certain something typical of so many corporate brews ( ie . even though this is an ale , there 's a pervading smell of cold steamed veggies ) . flavor is a bit off , considering the style , but not that bad for what it is . has a cinnamon-y , or potpourri , sort of spicing , some orange zest , with the malt having a toasted/caramel-like edge ... the yeast is clearly a bit lower grade than most authentic belgian pales , and the hops are on the fruitier side . pretty juicy , with the sweetness well-controlled and the spicing done tastefully . one to drink with an open mind and open palate , because it 's really not very `` belgian '' at all . too carbonated , not having the softness and smoothness it really should . a little bit of fruitiness sticks around in the finish , and this even has a little stickiness , texturally . the bubbles are just too bright . nothing totally offensive , but it drinks more like a spiced american amber than a belgian pale ale . there 's such a high standard for belgians of any variety , this sort of so-so american attempt is pretty weak if you 're a fan of the real deal . but in a blind taste test , you could enjoy a few of these on a hot summer day and not be ashamed of it ."

S"( not on tap ) 2nd review of this beer ( had the 2009 vintage ) today picked up a 2010 vintage and it needs another review . i was excited to get this , see this beer everywhere but really enjoyed it last time i had it - wtf happened ? i 'm not sure if i got a bad bottle , or if they messed something up this year , but this is not the beer i had in 2009 . looks like a normal , nice reddish brown strong ale , not much lacing , but that 's understandable at 11.7 % ( new abv ? ) . smell is where it really comes out that this beer is not ok - it smells like a skunky , bready , strong lager - almost smells like super tenents or something raunchy , only a bit of redeeming wine like character , but more boozy ... not alright . ( i even let it sit for 30 min to see if it would dissipate ) taste is just ok for a strong ale - a bit of sweet stuff , bready malts , but tastes viscous , strong and harsh - a little hop backbone at the end but nothing much ... could be more sticky so mouthfeel is not bad . ca n't give it much in the drinkability departmet - harsh , pretty gnarly , and tastes every bit of 11.7 % . i 'm seriously dissapointed in this beer from a pretty darn good brewery , unless im going crazy , this is not the same beer i tried in 2009 ."

S"poured straight up black . half-inch of brown head - slightly creamy . my nose ... suddenly i smell hops ! pine forest ! my god , am i drinking an ipa ? chinook i think ... very piney and spicy . i poured it 5 minutes ago and i 'm just staring and sniffing at the goblet . should i drink it ? i 'm a bit nervous given the `` oaked '' craze lately . i had a bad experience with the oaked arrogant bastard . ok ... i 'm going to sip it now ... i just sipped my first ipa stout . overwhelming spicy and piney hops , slight citrus , and tight bitterness that leaves little room for the roasted , almost burnt malts . while i admit i 'm a hophead , i was n't breaking this open to taste hops ... i wanted roasty chocolate , earthy malts and a slight vanilla from the `` oaking '' . instead i was hit with insane hop aroma and flavor . it gets high rating for the looks and mouthfeel - nice long taste with a dry biting finish . final word : the official bjcp guidelines say it 's ok for an imperial stout to have `` medium-low to high hop flavor ( any variety ) '' , but when a stout is n't balanced with the needed malt it 's just not right ... . i just ca n't recommend this one ."

S"very dense two finger plus head , deep brown in color and mostly micro-froth with a few small real bubbles interspersed here and there , lacing slides down the glass easily . entirely , impenetrably opaque , looks more like dark , dark , dark brown than black , no hue changes around the rims . in the nose you primarily get mixed dark and milk chocolate , coffee ice cream , candied cherry , plum , date , chocolate covered raisin scents , when swirled it releases more bitter pink grapefruit and chicory notes , so thick and alcoholic that these fall back quickly into the mix . full-bodied , has a creamy and strongly carbonated mouth feel which relieves a good deal of heaviness . the chicory , wood smoke bitterness more obvious here , the grapefruit element less so . there 's a drier complexion to the chocolate , coffee bits , hence no real caramel undertones . the plum , raisin , date , cherry , fig fruit shines best towards the finish . quite flavorful , however , too overwhelming to really enjoy more than a glass or so ."

S'slightly hazy amber color with a decent creamy ivory head that retains fairly well and manages some nice lace . the aroma is very mild , bready malt the taste is also mainly toasted malt with some hints of caramel , vague fruitiness ( apples/pears ? ) and an earthy , grassy hops finish . slightly sweet , a bit thin and watery , but creamy and easy enough to drink . if you like mild english ales , this could be worth a try .'

S"certainly a bitter brew on the nose ... .lots of citrus and pine resin there . hoppiness is the main smell , although i do get a little biscuit . the taste ? ? phew . lots of pine and grapefruit bitterness in this one . just a cutting bitterness that takes anything that was in your mouth before and eliminates it . this is a bitterness that lasts far into the finish with a stubbornness that i have seen in few beers ... getting rid of it after the swallow takes a little while . there 's a little bit of citrus undercurrent during the body but not much . if there 's malt , it 's been beaten back so badly that i do n't get it . part of what i like about some dipa 's is that they 're flavorful in a complex way . they do such a good job of blending heavy malts with the high ibu 's . here , the attempt has been made to make something akin to `` hop juice '' . i 'm not sure that i see what the brewing expertise is to do that . it 's not really all that drinkable nor is it interesting ."

S"picked up this beer in a 6-pack of bottles from a gas station of all places on my way back from des moines , iowa . i was intrigued by the label with the sad face when right-side up and the happy face when upside-down ... we have since lovingly nicknamed this brew `` upside-down beer '' . appearance : poured into a tall pilsner glass to appreciate fully . the snow-white head is fairly large ... .over two fingers thick to start and then trails off somewhat quickly leaving a rocky appearance , leaving little to no lacing on the glass . this brew is noticeably cloudy and a golden , orangish-yellow color . smell : smells of orange peel and lemons . very citrousy , but you can pick up a hint of yeast . taste : tastes of oranges , sweet malt , and a hint of lemon . mouthfeel : creamy & smooth all the way . urges you to drink more with every sip . drinkability : ca n't be anything short of a 4-4.5 , but i give it a solid 5 based on personal preference . sitting by the pool on a hot summer day , you could drink these easily all afternoon and be refreshed with every sip . overall , i must commend shiner on , what i think , is probably their finest beer . a fan favorite around these parts in the summer ."

S"11.5 oz . screwcap bottle that snaps open with authority , bracing me for an overflow that never happened . poured into my large deschutes flute , dernire volont is a hazy gold with an absolutely massive , super rocky white head that leaves massive chunks of foam and cobweb lace as it ever so slow settles down . it took several pours for me to squeeze it all into this 16 glass , magnificent ! smell is bright herbal hops , wheat and banana like belgian esters , which come to the fore as it warms , gaining some sugary , tropical fruit notes . taste is heavy on the wheat with a big dusty bite from the ( noble ) dry-hopping , with the yeast softly lingering in the background . this is has a very aggressive flavor , more belgian ipa then bpa to me , especially with the intensity of the dry , bitter finish . pretty good but a bit abrasive at first , i preferred it warmer , which allowed the esters to open up and temper the hops . mouthfeel is dry and crisp , with a medium body . drinkablity was average to me as a belgian pale ale ( or ipa for that matter ) , as the heavy hops cull the quaffablity.still , i enjoyed it enough to savor the last few sips for as long as possible . at $ 5 a pop i probably wo n't be revisiting this to often , it was very interesting and i 'm glad i gave it a try - another strange brew from dieu du ciel ."

S"750ml caged and corked bottle , bottled november 2007 , bought at lou 's in augusta . pours a hazy golden amber-red body with a quarter inch ( if that ) of off-white head . smells fruity/citrusy and woody . tastes citrusy , pithy , malty , with a fair bit of wood and hints of vanilla toward the finish . a little bit of alcohol warming is evident on the finish , but buy no means overwhelming or solvent-like . on the heavier side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation , bordering on sticky mouthfeel but the carbonation helps make this one more drinkable than it might otherwise be . tasty and complex . i think i 'll stick to drinking allagash tripel on a more regular basis , but this is a very good beer and definitely glad i gave this one a go . one of the best barrel-aged beers i 've had so far ."

S"poured from a 22oz bomber into my drie fonteinen tumbler . clear lava body with an active sudsy brilliant lavender head which recedes to a persistent half-pinkie of foam . lacing is sandy and fast moving , though a few weeping willow patterns remain behind . smells of tart cherry with a hint of citrus ( from hops ? ) and very mild yeast . subdued , but inviting . the flavor unfortunately tastes like a watered down lambic - while the fruit is still present , there are no wild flavors present whatsoever . the malt and alcohol mid-palate add some interest , but the alcohol runs over the delicate fruit flavor , making the cherry seem almost artificial , though you can tell the base kriek is pure . not quite medium-bodied , moderately carbonated , somewhat creamy and smooth , and surprisingly warming ( though not hot ) . easy drinking and refreshing , but i ca n't get over the feeling that this is a waste of good kriek ... as an overall beer , this might be a little underrated , but it just does n't live up to the style . while i applaud new belgium 's experimentation , sometimes you just ca n't improve upon tradition ."

S"appearance - pours a reddish copper with a thin head of white . moments later , the cover is bare save for an uneven ring . somehow manages to place a few bits of lacing here and there . turns pretty cloudy/chunky with the last few ounces added . aroma - sweet with a base , indistinct fruitiness . hints of yeast at times and a full vapory alcohol effect on a deep inhale . smells pleasant enough if somewhat plain . taste - before the grains can make any impact , a rush of sweetness and alcohol move in and set up . a bubble gum or maybe pez candy flavor , a big alcohol effect which ducks any harshness . the swallow begins a trail of warmth from the back of the throat all the way down to the stomach , like the tail of a comet . i 'm no expert on the style , but as far as i know this tastes pretty good and would probably also do well if aged a while . the aftertaste is more like an after-thought , mostly just shadows of the candy flavor and the abv . mouthfeel - an element of heaviness , syrupiness that helps without overdoing . bubbles are lively , well done . drinkability - i 'm glad i bought these at the founder 's brewing company event sponsored by the dilly deli , but this is n't something i 'd keep around ."

S"okay , thanks to bditty for getting this one online . he 's right , there are a lot of other malt liquors out there that put camo to shame ... i keep a watch on that `` lower left hand '' section of the beer cooler at the local gas station . who could pass up a new `` camo '' with double digit abv % ... for $ 1.25 ? i could not . this stuff had a very pretty color.if you never smelled or drank it , you may think it was some nice belgian . the aroma was like an old corncrib . i braced myself and took a swig from a glass ... it gave me a shiver , but i think that was all mental . the alcohol taste lingered up in my sinuses , but after about 3 swallows everything settled down . i stopped pouring into a glass and just went straight for the can . it was just as smooth as `` hurricane '' , but it packed that delayed punch like only camo can . by the time i was 12 oz deep , i began thinking everything my wife said was funny . after i killed the can , i immediately started looking for more beer in the fridge so i could keep the buzz alive . this stuff if made to do one thing , and cheaply . i did n't expect anything else and i was n't dissappointed . for 10.5 % malt liquor , it went down as smooth as it could . and let 's face it , for $ 1.25 , i will drink more of these . the only difficult part is buying them.. it 's as humiliating as buying condoms when you are 16..you just know that person behind the counter knows ... but , what you plan to do is so much fun , so you muster up the nerve to buy it ..."

S'pours a medium amber with an offwhite head that vanishes in the blink of an eye to leave just a thin cap of white on top . aroma is mainly of roasted malts and a bit of caramel . the smell is not that intense , its more like a perception . taste is ehhh , nothing to get to excited about . decent enough malty flavour with some roasted notes that were echoed in the nose . just enough hops to dry it out some , but no real noticible hop contribution . mouthfeel is decent , medium carbonation makes it easy to drink as does the lightness of body . the drinkability is higher since the abv is only around 4 % . the flavor is mild enough that one could drink these all afternoon at a cook out or something . the only drawback with the low abv is that the beer is lacking in a little body .'

S"pours out bright , light gold with pink-ish tints and sits a beaming ruby-orange in the glass witha small light white head . fades to a faint surfacing of foam with some lacings around the glass . completely mezmerizing to say the least . aroma is clearly and distinctly malty , lightly toasted and crackery with balancing hops presence . getting to the thick of it , raspberry aroma is very mild are not over-pronounced . tastes moderately sweet up front , crackery malts dominate while spicy alcoholic tones pick up from behind , ushering in some hops bitterness with little to no flavor interaction . raspberries are there , always there , pecking in at the sides but never getting too feisty . finish is hot , damn hot and drying , not dry , but definately requiring some thirst quencher . crisp and clean in the mouth with tact and effervescent carbonation in the teensiest of bubbles . medium-full in body . not a huge fan of this at this point . it is indeed very well managed and balance is achieved on all fronts , including fruit , but man , it is a drag . a beatiful looking glass of beer , but a hell of a long ways away from anything worthwhile , especially when factoring in cost . while many have mentioned that its potency listing seems inaccurate or at least very hidden , i would disagree . it is quite evident , both in flavor and in feel , as well as in the dreaded cough-syrup comparison that almost immediately came to mind . however , credit shall be given where it 's due , and it does deserve at least one try . who knows , maybe you will love it , but i will pass ."

S"an london pub classic . pours a clear , copper colour with a creamy/bubbly white head that reduces to a relatively rocky film , leaving some patchy traces of lace . aromas of honey soaked hops come through on the nose with undertones of bread and caramel . flavours of honey with caramel , bready , nutty malts come through strong with a nice classic english touch of bitterness in the background throughout the sip . finish is clean and bitter sweet with a good amount of minerality as well . mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy with the right amount of carbonation tingling the palate in the background . leaves a creamy mouthfeel on the finish yet is clean and well balanced . real smooth . an ideal session ale for any occasion . it 's a real easy beer to drink and i could see myself polishing off a few of these in a row . it offers a nice flavour profile . nothing crazy in terms of flavour but far from boring . a nice all around ale ."

S"from my birthday beer run , from the bottle to my brooklyn tulip . a- thick jet black color , with a tall bubbly head of off white . lots of tiny bubbles in my glass as the head dissipates into a sea brine of film . s- coffee , chocolate , and sweet caramel aromas merge into a complex conglomerate with a subtle hint of booze and the slightest trace of hops . overall character of scent is a bit sticky and sweet . t- coffee is the dominant force here , but it is n't an extreme java flavor . a few complex flavors make what seem like cameo appearances on the tongue hiding slightly under the coffee . a slight bit of tartness on the backend , and a weird bit of funky sour . lacks a bit of body and seems a bit watered down . m- a little thin for the ris style . d- the thinness and watered-down qualities that detract from the taste and mouthfeel actually help out in the drinkability department , and i think i 'll give the brewers the benefit of the doubt that they were going for that . not the best ris for a real afficianado of the style , but i think high seas did a nice job creating an ris for the masses ."

S'a : pours clear amber , very nice two finger off white head , laces very nicely and with every sip . settled to a thin overall layer with a thick halo . s : first is pine , then some floral hops , reminds me of hopslam without the honey . t : good amount of pine hop up front and in the aftertaste that is very long lasting . malt sweetness is just enough to lightly balance the hops out . 10 % abv is not noticeable . m : a good smooth yet thick dipa , lightly coating . o : i like this a little better than hopslam , in that it is not as hop forward but still is , if that makes sense .'

S'this beer pours a golden yellow coor with a slight orange tint . it has a thick fluffy off white head , with a slight orange tint . the head fades slowly , leaving many laces . this beer has a grainy aroma . it smells slightly spicy . cloves , coriander , and maybe orange peel . it has a slightly citrusy aroma . the alcohol content is slightly present in the aroma . this beer tastes a lot like the aroma . it has a grainy flavor . it has an earthy yeast flavor also . the alcohol in quite present in the flavor . spices and some citrus flavors are also present . this beer is full bodied . it goes down smooth , leaving a grainy aftertaste . this beer is highly carbonated . i doubt this beer would make a good session beer . it is high in alcohol , so you would need to limit your self . the flavor is quite aggressive also . too many would not be great . one , however , is good . i will definately drink this beer again . it is a winner .'

S"an american wheat ale with traditional witbier spices . clear , yellow and somewhat modestly carbonated , looks a bit like a glass of urine , though not as appetizing . the nose is bready and spicy , lightly sweet with noticeable but not overwhelming coriander and orange peel . citrus and whole wheat bread flavors up front , semi-sweet and spicy with strong coriander . there 's a bit of astringency from the spice and a faint slickness that prevents this from being as dry and smooth as i 'd like , but it 's not terribly offensive . carbonation is at a moderate level , a bit low for the style ; greater effervescence would help cut the sweetness and make for a more refreshing mouthfeel . finishes spicy with a lingering sweet bready flavor . decent ."

S"special thanks to kels for bringing this - a great beer with quite a bit going on . poured from the bottle into a pint glass . appearance : a deep copper color with a bit of amber coming through ; a nice one finger fluffy white head that dwindles to a very full skim on the surface ; an oily lacing that does n't stick around and slides quickly back into the drink ; the body is very clear and shows moderate carbonation . smell : a strong blend of citrusy/piney hops and strong ( suprisingly strong , that is ) malty caramel presence as well . taste : the hpos are very present in the flavor and come across as a little more grassy than they did in the nose , i would also say there is a bit of a coppery flavor in the taste as well ; there is a slightly woody presence ; the alcohol is pretty big and little `` burny '' mouthfeel : a lot of hop resin makes it oily and sticky ; the carbonation is a bit prickly but overall it 's a fairly smooth drinking dipa ; alcohol warms the mouth and chest . drinkability : moderate . for me , this is a beer that i would prefer to sit down and just nurse it for a while as opposed to trying to get through a few . the abv is pretty big and i would definitely be feeling it if i attempted more than one . a very good beer overall ."

S"2010 vintage . poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip . a : pours a hazy brown with a one finger white head that settles but does n't really go away completely . s : sweet red grapes and a little bit of a winelike scent . t : the grapes start off here with sweetness and then a bit of sour , but not as much as an american wild or a lambic , and there is noticeable alcohol burn on the finish . there is a clean malt and hop profile underneath the dominant grapes , perhaps a pilsner or pale base . m : very well carbonated and a balanced medium body . d : well , it 's up and it 's down . it is 9 % abv , but the burn on the finish of the taste is harsh and this brew feels like it hits harder than only 9 . this bottle is somewhat of a chore to drink alone , but the sweetness and sourness of the grapes is really quite pleasant , and as it warms , the crispness of the pilsner/pale malt backbone makes up for the increased alcohol burn . this sort of reminds me of wine , but like a mix between a sweet red and less sweet white ."

S"just returned from a beer tour of michigan and kuhnhenns was our first stop . i 've been dying to get to drink more of their beers as i 've only sampled one up to this point , so this was well worth the wait ! review is from notes taken on 6/18/2010 and poured into a snifter . appearance : pour is a coppery and amber/ruby color and starts with a 1/2 finger creamy tan head that fades quickly to a thin skim on the surface ; body has great clarity and shows no real carbonation ; loose oily spots of lacing are left behind . smell : strong presence of very ripe and dark fruits - reminiscent of figs and dates ; nice belgian spices , especially coriander ; definite presence of alcohol in the nose with that big abv . i love the fruitiness and how spicy sweet it is , and it 's very robust -- ca n't wait to get this on the palate . taste : wow - big alcohol right up front as would be expected from this brewery , but once you get past that there 's a huge presence of the sweet and ripe to over-ripe dark fruitiness ( figs and dates , almost a little raisin aspect too ) ; a nice sweet caramel maltiness with the warm belgian spices and even a bit of a light chocolaty presence in the end as it warms . very nice overall ! mouthfeel : very warm and vaporous alcohol leaves the mouth tingly ; a moderate level of stickiness that 's moist is left on the roof of the mouth ; body is of medium weight and the carbonation is non-existent so the body is very smooth ( it really pulls off not having any carbonation though as the big abv gives the body some life due to the heat ) . drinkability : moderate at best because of the super high abv , but it 's really an amazing sipper and would be great in the winter . i 'd love to get some bottles of this to age and see if it mellows out at all , but even as is , it 's pretty freaking amazing . something tells me that i may have just set the highest review for this beer ."

S'i had a glass of the original and a glass each of the raspberry and woodruff syrup versions . the original was a very light but hazy yellow with a small head . the smell was lactic acid tartness . the taste was a nice amount of tart flavor , without being over the edge , keeping it exceptionally refreshing and drinkable . the raspberry presents itself as a hazy pink color and the smell is tart with a nice berry aroma . the taste was probably the best out of the 3 versions , with the raspberry flavor complimenting the base beer really well . the woodruff had a green hue to it and smelled and tasted almost identical to the marshmallows from lucky charms cereal . it was actually a pretty enjoyable drink , but it was killing me for about 5 minutes trying to figure out what taste from my childhood it reminded me of . overall , another nice effort from my local brewery .'

S"oh , my . god . i am so happy the world cup is in germany . my local stores all have a special `` campaign '' with a lot of new , foreign , and plenty of german beers being promoted . i 've seen some that have made me mildly happy , ( ooh , newcastle brown ) . but today i saw an endcap with all weihenstephaner beers , 4 different styles ! i was unashamedly vocally appreciative , and i noticed the locals noticing me but i did n't care . what a cool sight . my first kristal weizen . i have tried - and thoroughly enjoyed - three of the other beers made by this , the oldest brewery in the world . and to finish the story of the first paragraph , all the others have been through mail order from a special internet store . this was my first time seeing it at a normal store , in person . this is my fourth , and this ancient brewery is threatening to become my favorite . i just love the label , damn it makes me thirsty . after reading the beer style description here on ba , i would say this fits it perfectly . looks like i would expect - like a filtered hefeweizen , crystal clear , highly fizzy , beautiful huge head . smell is slightly muted due to mosquito-repelling smoke in the air , ( oh my god , how am i going to review for the next few months , with a dulled sense of smell or full of bites ? you see , in japan these fuckers get you in or out of your house . they know no bounderies ) . but i can still pick up great weiss bier scents . spicy , banana , i guess there 's really not as much wheat as a normal hefeweizen . so the smell is not as good as it 's more famous , higher rated brother , but it 's still good . taste and mouthfeel are very predictable . just what you would expect . it 's crystal clear ! smooth . perfect balance , highly thirst-quenching and tasty . interesting note : this would probably be a good beer to give to a total rookie , as it is closer in appearance to a boring macro . as opposed to a cloudy , foggy hefeweizen which can definitely scare some noobs . i have a new mission for converting my macro-swilling co-workers !"

S'this really is a completely different beer than the original . the hops are still evident but in more of a supporting role - similar to how hops are present in some hoppy imperial stouts but somewhat masked by the malts . in this beer , the hops are masked by the forward flavors of bourbon and smoke . the appearance is lighter than i would have expected , while the head is more than i would have guessed - good lacing . the smell is of bourbon , but sweet caramel is present . the flavor is bourbon and hops - very smooth and drinkable for what it is .'

S'bright gold , and clearer than expected with gushing jets of carbonation feeding a tight and durable ivory capstone . soup cracker nose , inched sweeter with a vague vanillin essense , and then drier whispers of lavender , milkthistle , and clover . staunchly malted up from with a saltine tint that migrates fully and puffier towards french bread . it gathers pear skins and vanilla near the middle , as it teeters sweeter . the finish full of green stems and light weedy bitterness . the body is light and persistantly carbonated with a taut structure that ushers this effortlessly down the throat . this is vastly impressive and amazingly fresh tasting .'

S"freshness date . expires aug 2011. pours cloudy . lots of carbonation . small head sticks around . color reminds me of a yellow peach . looks okay for a wheat beer . smells nice . great blend of hops and malt on nose . smells fresh and lively . a little sharp on the carbonation . getting some grassiness . not sure if this is intended tastes kind of out of place . but it is unusual and interesting at the same time . citrus then biscuit malt then more citrus . i 'm finding this a very complex and interesting taste experience . not a big fan of the carbonation but it seems part and parcel with the whole experience . finding the drinkability a bit low as it seems to sit kind of heavy in the belly . and there is hardly much aftertaste ... the beer doesnt demand more sipping . definitely a summer beer when your thirst draws you back naturally to the glass . drinking it the wrong time of year so with that in mind , i 'm gon na go purely on the taste factor and this one is hitting a home run for me ."

S"pours a cloudy orange into my glass with a couple fingers of white moussy head that drop to a lace and leave a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass . not the most attractive pale , but not bad looking . looks like it 's going to taste good . : - ) aroma is mostly of fresh hops , the dry hopping really comes out . good clean , earthy , green hop aroma that 's not too citrus or resiny . there 's a hint of bready malt backbone too , but no sweetness of honey , just lightly grainy and biscuity . flavor is much the same as the nose ... very balanced , but leaning towards the hops . some hints of pie crust-like breadiness , overridden neatly by the delicious , balanced hopping . there are definitely multiple levels of hop flavor in this one , and it comes off very cleanly . one of the most refreshing pale ales i 've enjoyed . the mouthfeel really shines in this one , as it has enough body to be assertive , but is just light enough to make it ridiculously drinkable . carbonation is medium , just right ... not too high , to give it that tongue-dancing spiciness , but certainly not flat . finish is as clean as the rest , with just a slight lingering dryness from the bittering hops . this is an exceptional pale ale . there 's not too much to say about it other than clean , balanced , refreshing , lightly hoppy ... if you want a good hoppy beer that you could still drink a ton of ... this is the one . rides that line very well ( better than dales ) at not being an ipa , but still being assertive . highly recommended . cheers !"

S'pours a pale yellow color with a large 1 inch head that goes away quickly . resembles a freshly voided urine specimen in appearance . just looking at this beer in the glass made my testicles shrink to the size of raisins . aroma was of cereal grains and slightly fruity , citrusy notes in the nose . taste was similar to every other u.s. macro : fruity taste mixed with some corny/vegetable flavors and light malt character . hop character non-existent . mouthfeel was very light on the palate , just a step above water . drinkability was terrible . the almost total lack of taste made this a drain pour after only half the can was gone . not recommended .'

S'pours clear golden yellow with one and a half finger soapy head that dissipates quite quickly . in terms of smell i get honey , tons of white grape , apple , and a bit of pear , along with some alcohol . smell is quite good although the fruit notes definitely predominate , almost smells like a white wine . the taste is a fair bit different from the smell . i get far more honey in the taste with some white grape and green apple , and certain cidery quality to the beer . also i get distinctive floral bitterness which seems to be a combination of the alcohol and the saffron . i quite enjoyed the taste , although it is quite sweet . the taste moves from honey sweetness , to dry cidery apple and white grape to a floral bitterness at the end . this beer is quite dry , although a bit sticky . the mouthfeel is pretty good , but there is hardly any carbonation , so some may feel that it is flat , but given what this beer it was still pretty good . drinkability is where this beer loses some points . very enjoyable in small quantities , but the honey sweetness is a little much and means that one bottle of this can be a little bit difficult to finish . if one split a bottle between two or three this would work well as a dessert drink or possibly as an apperitif .'

S'in high school and college , i must admit that on more than one occasion that i did indulge in an olde english 40oz . appearance is yellow , clear , and unattractive . smell is pointing towards gross , turn your nose away , smells like some alcohol in a science lab . taste is bland , watery , and unpleasant . mf is of some corn , slightly sugary , with a really bad after-taste , without a doubt it is difficult to consume all 40oz , let alone 3 of them in a night , which i have done several times in the past , ahhhh the good old days .'

S"appearance : came in a uniquely shaped bottle with comments on how it was brewed in honor of the battle of britain . pours with a solid thumb and half finger of head that looks slightly creamy . the head itself laces like crazy and retains quite well . the beer itself is a crystal clear brown however the carbonation looks to be a little be excessive . still , impressive thus far . smell : everyone 's favorite four legged mammal returns , because this stuff is skunked . i am catching some dry hop scent with a touch of barley and caramel , but it is mostly buried by the skunk sadly . taste : the beer starts of with a mild fruity taste with a touch of caramel , it then turns to a bitter bland malt and fruit flavor which is then instantly taken over by dry and bitter hops that leave the beer tasting like hay mixed with dried fruit . it 's one of those beers that is n't average to taste , but has cons that balance out the pros . mouthfeel : it leaves the mouth fairly dry and while the aftertaste is not that strong , it does overstay it 's welcome . also this beer has way too much carbonation going on . i also find that the beer transitions between flavors poorly . drinkability : this stuff is n't very refreshing because it is so dry . not only that , but the excessive carbonation makes this beer very gassy . it does n't go down that smoothly and does n't sit well . i would n't be able to drink more then one , and frankly at the half way point i do n't want to keep drinking this stuff . final thoughts : i though after seeing this beer pour , this was going to be a winner . however , as the skunk took over and the carbonation leaved me belching every couple of minutes i was disappointed . i dunno , i would n't recommend this beer to anyone , unless they really enjoyed a dry taste ."

S"this is my second shot at this beer . first one was a 750 that i got at bottleworks a few years ago . this one is a 12 oz . bottled in november 2004 so it 's almost a year old . huge aromatics on this sucker . plum , dried fruit , tobacco ( no shit ) roast malt and a fair amount of alcohol . off the lovibond scale of darkness . black as can be , no light gets through this . head , not really , but a small amount of brown around the rim of the glass . tons of dark roast malt flavor . underneath is a ton of malt and quite a bit of bittering hops . finishes malty sweet and big . lots of fermentation character of fruit , esters and chocolate . body , well , pretty much huge . carbonation level is pretty low , probably a combination of age and high alcohol . i 'm totally enjoying this with a portion of chimay aged cheese . nice sipping beer . drinkability is a little unfair . could n't take it often , but works just right for a savouring beer ."

S'poured from 750 ml bottle into glass chalice . tends to pour a rather large head that is fluffy white in character with big bubbles . the beer is a hazy blond . some lacing sticks down the glass in tufts . aroma of lemons and grapefruit with an undercurrent of yeast . despite the citrus notes , smells sweet . tastes of sweetened fruit : lemons and maybe pears in syrup . a bit of malt and yeast play behind this mid-taste and the finish is peppery with a sweetness that lingers , verging on cloying . lighter bodied and pretty heavily carbonated , tank 7 almost feels like champagne in the mouth . a little too sweet to be highly drinkable , this beer nevertheless has good complexity but would also be a great treat on a hot summer afternoon .'

S"as far as easily-accessible , ubiquitous beers go , this is one of the best . found in smalltown groceries and dive bars , as well as more upscale establishments , sierra nevada pale ale is a great everyday/session beer . affordable , tasty , accessible . a good pour results in a soapy head atop a beautiful amber/copper body . sometimes i just love to look at this one . the smell is unremarkable , only very faint hops present , citrus too faint ( considering the orange-y hint in the flavor ) , but once past the lips this hoppy ale has a satisfying flavor , citrus-y , a pleasing and slightly bitter pinch on the back of the tongue . refreshing in the mouth ( an excellent summer beer ) but if it stays too long it gets a bit tart . i drink this as a `` daily beer '' since lots of my favorite stuff is usually too precious to bust out every single day , which is why i 've rated the drinkability high . never gets old . considering the local choices , i 'll take this over mega-brewery headache-beer anyday .

S"been wanting to try this since i saw it on ba . pours a cloudy orange color that 's a few shades darker than a normal wheat beer . not quite dunkel territory , but reminiscent of the erdinger oktoberfest weizen . smell is like a normal pale wheat but a little sharper and it has some peppery yeast in there . definitely a hops kick , too . the taste is a little odd . it starts off bitter with the yeast and grapefruity hops . there 's some orange peel , bready wheat , and it finishes with a little bit of alcohol burn and bitterness . i 'm picking up a little caramel sweetness as it warms , but the overwhelming flavor more bitter than sweet . it 's not terrible as there 's a decent amount of depth , but it just feels like something is missing . i wo n't be biased because of the naming convention , but i think a german or belgian yeast would serve this well . as it is , it 's just bitter and it gets old fast . it 's thick , but appropriately so . no complaints there . this is a sipper and it just feels like it should n't be . it 's only 7.5 % abv , but it feels like more . pretty blah to be honest . it 's okay at first , but after 1/2 glass i 'd had enough . i put down one weizen glass ' worth and i was prepared to dump the rest . pyramid can do better than this . i do n't mind their normal pale wheat and their apricot 's pretty good for what it is . this just needed something else to carry the extra alcohol and hops and it did n't have that . misc notes : i was actually about to pour out what was left in the bottle after my one glass , but decided to mix it with some apple juice to create a makeshift apfelweiss . it 's not as good as a german one , but the extra hops add a nice touch . i 'd rather have that mix than this beer by itself . it does n't justify buying the beer , but if you 're stuck with it , it 's not that bad ."

S'a- for a complex expected beer this was surprisingly golden amber-colored , clear and filtered . the intended bubbles of this style were not present and with a half finger head . s- aroma from this beer fruity , with apple , pear and spice . overall quite appealing . t- the initial flavor screamed of fermented apple cider with a ton of added malt . imagine yourself on a deserted island with only caramels and apples and you must melt them down as your only source of sustenance . after a few days you find a skanky hop bush and throw a few hops in at the end just so you know that they are there . very little hoppiness is present , maybe only at the end . m- the carbonation is similar to that of champagne with very small bubbles that are easily detected with each sip . somewhat thin but coats the mouth . d- overall each sip became less bearable . the flavors wore on you and just were not that desirable . i could not imagine drinking more than one glass at a sitting as this beer was high in alcohol content and strongly flavored . notes- this beer was purchased at a local watering hole and served in pint glasses . the champagne flutes depicted in the in the advertisement were not given to us by the female bartender . it was worth trying as we were very curious but i would not purchase again especially at the price and just was not that enjoyable . peace , love , big tuna'

S'pours a very cloudy dark gold with very little head . leaves a really light foam film and decent lacing . the smell is rather overpowering ; caramelized sugar , fruit esters ( typical citrus and some plum ) , cinnamon , grainy malt , and alcohol . taste is incredibly sweet ; lots of malt and fruit . very sugary and boozy . not at all balanced . mouthfeel is syrupy ; very little carbonation . this was my first drainpour . disappointing because i rather liked the 621 .'

S'was extremely tentative when trying this beer , being a fan of brown ales a little weary about the high alcohol content , but boy was i glad i tried this , probably one of the most complex brown ales that i have had so far , look for a full review at a later date'

S"time to revisit the first `` extreme '' beer i ever had . it was only three years ago that , at the end of the night , some friends saw this on the menu and ordered me one . not one minute after receiving it , the group i was with announced we were all leaving , so i had to chug down a bomber of this . it did n't take me long to realize this beer was unlike anything i 'd ever had before . appearance : pours an amber brown with ruby highlights and a sizable , large-bubbled beige head . it has a lot of staying power too - morphing into a rocky cap that does n't dissipate . tons of lace is visible all down the glass . smell : very modestly hoppy . with all of the insane hop profiles of so many beers , this one kind of subdues itself just enough , but still is able to let you know what 's in store . the hops are citrusy and spicy and highlight a sneaky caramel malt base that lurks in the background . taste : usually it 's obvious which flavor to begin describing , but ab is so balanced , the decision is tough . the beer starts off somewhat on the malty side , lending a sweetness that will soon be balanced out by some tasty hops . they come on quite strong and are predominantly citrusy and piny . the finish remains hoppy and lingers long . mouthfeel : perhaps the one area where i feel this beer is lacking . it seems somewhat thick at first , but i ca n't help but find it a bit watery . i think with a beer this robust , it should have a bit more body to it . drinkability : excellent . the 7.2 % is well disguised . it 's strange how our definition of `` extreme '' has changed when one can imagine themselves drinking ab all night , but it really is the case . after that first taste of arrogant bastard three years ago , i had to look it up online . a quick google search led me to my first ever visit to beeradvocate.com . i have a lot to owe to ab and rightfully so . it 's a great beer ."

S'my wife bought some of this beer because she just loves this kind of beer style . plus the label makes it appealling to the lady drinkers at least in m.h.o . pour 12oz into mug . a . a very nice brownish-orange ... .kind of bronze color . head sticks around . a ton of bubbles quickly shoot to the top of the glass . s. carmel hints , herbal hops , smells good ! t. amazing taste , full bodied brew . a little bit dry for my taste but also very sweet & creamy . m. there is some bitter aftertase but not too bad . nice and frothy in the mouth . d. the dry lagery aftertaste may deter a few from having more than 2 or 3 of these but its a nice unique tasting beer . worth a taste for sure !'

S'highs : great dessert beer lows : drinkability dark burgundy/plum color pour with no visible carbonation . head is thin brown-tan that fades to a thick ring that remains until the drink is gone . minimal lacing . nose smells dusty/musty , the same smell i recall from chapeaus apricot lambic . strong , sweet cherry smell as well . taste is initially very , very sweet , again dusty , quickly transforming to a sour , puckering , intense flavor . not bad at all if you are into lambics . very good dessert beer taste . finishes up on a lightly bitter , and again dusty note . mouth is surprisingly bubbly with some sparkling carbonation ; otherwise , its slightly syrupy . drinkabilitywell , this one is really too sweet ( intense ) to have more than one , or even a whole 12 oz . bottle . overall : a good dessert beer ; try it appropriately .'

S"appearance : fairly standard lager gold , not as light as i 'd expect it to be . good carbonation in the body and it produced a finger of head that did n't lace and barely retained . smell : average and if it were n't a light beer it would be scored lower . straw like malt , a touch of earthy hops that comes off a bit mossy because of a slight undertone of skunk . not bad , nothing great and stronger then most light beers . taste : pretty much standard macro lager taste . hay like malt with a touch of corn , that turns into a slight touch of earthy hops . once again , not bad for a light beer , but nothing to write home about and it may come off as watery to some . mouthfeel : well the carbonation is done well that the transitioning is smooth , but it does cloy a little bit too much . i 'd give it 3.25 if i could , but it falls on the lower end of the scale , mainly because of my earlier generosity . drinkability : this beer fairs very well as a guzzler , and it 's really designed for hot summer days . no issues getting it down , no issues with gas or bloating and refreshing in extreme . final thoughts : well , this one fared far better then i thought it would , and i did enjoy it more the moosehead light , mainly because it seems simpler and not just a watered down version of moosehead . still , there are many better beers out there , so save your money on this one ."

S"served to me at the peculiar pub in manhattan , poured into a pint glass . a-this beer poured a beautiful , dark black , as one would expect based on the beer 's name . beer was completely opaque and topped with a quick thick brown head , which sustained surprisingly well . s-aromas of chocolate and heavy roasted barley dominated , with hints of dark fruity esters as well . as i expected , though , the name says it all : chocolate . t-this is one indulgent brew : d thick with chocolate flavors , dark and dry , at times almost bitter chocolate . this deep chocolate character pairs beautifully with the in-balance roasted malt flavors . in with it all , some estery , almost sweetish flavors make themselves apparent . m-fully , creamy body , at times somewhat oily , but really more like a thick milkshake . wonderful . carbonation was low , playing well off the full body . d-this beer is a winter seasonal , so i did n't expect to have an opportunity to drink it while i was in new york . however , the peculiar pub had bottles of it , and knowing it 's high abv would allow for increased shelf life of this brew , i went for it . it was a rainy day , and relatively cold , so this beer went down very nicely , warming me subtley as i chatted with my table . very drinkable , very complex ."

S"like the three finger head in my goose island tulip glass . good carbonation and sunshine color . the only thing that brought down an almost perfect performance was the crazy yeast flakes that were abundant in this brew throughiout the whole 750 ml 's of this bottle . at first i thought it was ice from maybe sitting in my fridge for too long . not the case , straight up yeast sediment that decided to stir at this moment i guess . the aroma is a light fruit and alcohol . pretty muted from a belgian brewery of this prestige . the taste seems very m , uted and subtle with the usual fruits and spices i 've come to expect and enjoy from this brewery . touches of honeydew and cantaloupe and anise and fennel . the light palate was hindered greatly by the alcohol with the feeling of sediment on each and every sip of this beer . did n't drink with as much exuberance as expected ."

S"stone is quite humble to call this a pale ale . it 's almost comical . the sweet , honeyed , malt-laden nose and palette along with the supportive , but unaggressively resinous hop backbone suggests old ale all the way . and were it an old ale , perhaps it 'd be a tad weak -- especially since stone 's sick interpretation of an old ale is arrogant bastard . i guess 7th anniversary is a hybrid of old and pale ales , managing to show off the complexity of the age-worthy malt without deflating the nuance of a classic american pale ale . and i guess stone could give a fuck what i think of how well they fit a style . `` if you want consistency , drink bud , '' i 'm sure they 'd say . glorious hopping reminiscent of sn celebration in its complexity and distinction . way too much malt for a pale ale . but really this is classic british old ale with a wonderful fresh citrus kick . sweet of fresh morning pastries . it even picks up the tiniest hint of sherry-like almondine nuttiness . a little buttery diacetyl late in the finish . 15 minutes later , this finishes with the dry fruitiness of a pale ale ; i do n't understand . stone 7th anniversary has what i would expect out of a well aged old ale . only 6 months into it , this beer 's destined for something really special . it might be too thin to really be a great vintage ale some day , but it 'll make the best run a simple `` pale ale '' ever could . as a young ba , i knocked the site and said that the bas missed the complexity of more delicate brews -- that their tongues were charred with high-octane stuff , primarily from stone . now that i 've earned some stripes , i see the error of my ways , but also have noticed how burnt my own tongue has gotten . stone 7th anniversary is a pale ale for experienced bas ; for those who said that pilsners and amber ales were the cat 's meow until they found out about barleywines and imperial everything . it reminds me of what i loved when i started , what i love now , and how much i have changed . this special release is my coming-of-age in a bottle . relax , relax . ng"

S"murky crimson-purple hue , burgundy highlights , the foamy head reached about a half finger in height , it had an odd tint to it , as expected it was pinkish but it was grossly white-gray as well . the foamy bubbles lasted a good while around the edge of the glass . spotty lace was produced as i drank it . the appearance is pleasant if not typical . the nose had terrific potency but i did not care for the bouquet i was presented , it was disgustingly sweet , it was like grape juice with sugar added , behind this feature of the aroma was something very similar to champagne but with a hollow ending . i did not find this scent inviting at all . the palate was startlingly at first , i found the sweet-tart black current taste overbearing . i got over it but the taste doesnt really develop much , it is like a candy for adults , sweet , tart , and sweeter . it is lively with flavor but it is nauseatingly sugary . i really dig big fruity beers but this one overwhelmed me . maybe i just dont like black currents . the tart finish stuck to my lips and the sweetness laced my throat triggering by brain to beg for water to wash it away . i did . medium-light in body , lively enough carbonation , i could see how this beer would be very refreshing if you enjoyed the taste . in my opinion cassis is the worst of the fruit lambics by lindemans . i cant see myself drinking this one again nor do i envision this pairing well with desserts . i can not recommend it . i `` willingly '' overpaid for this 12-ounce bottle in omaha , $ 7.00 ."

S"i was n't sure what to expect from this beer . in fact i do n't know what to do with dogfish head as a brewery in general . dfh is famous for its extreme beers and yet most beers that get that label are cloying and boozy . on the other hand , their less extreme beers are very pallatable but tend to be outdone by other examples of the style . 60 min ipa is good , sure , but i can name ten ipas i 'd rather drink . i think the best thing i 've had out of their line up is the palo santo marron . i tried the 120 min ipa and i thought it was interesting in a mind expanding way without actually tasting good . but now , i think we 're past the point in craft beer culture where making really gigantic beer is extreme . it 's been done . perhaps dfh 's angle from here on out is extreme beer ( that you can drink ) . i had a great experience with red & white and that type of `` experimental yet able to be swallowed '' is probably sam c 's best face . maybe what i 'm saying is this : unless there is a good reason lets keep the abv under 12 % . that 's where dfh 's best beer has been . *** this beer did n't taste that great and it was n't a journey for the mind . it 's just a really strong beer that is raisiny . a- little or no head ( a result of the 20 % abv no doubt ) . a brown color in the glass . s- best part of the beer . it smells like i 'm going to do a shot of vodka while eating apple pie . t- surprisingly spicy but not in a biting kind of way . way too much alcohol . m- a nice weight on the tongue but no carbonation d- one per session tops . probably best to drink a `` wine portion '' of this . i do n't want to come down to hard on this brewery because they are a beacon in this industry but i am realizing that these beers are not my style . i 'll stick to dfh 's more drinkable options . cheers !"

S'appearance : pours a clear golden color with a modest head that fades quickly to a ringlet ; not much lace , either smell : clearly the best part of the beer - the blend of the chilies comes through on the aroma ; smoky and hot taste : here is the downfall - this is a simple lager flavored with chilies ; the chilies overhwelm the taste and there is nothing else to add complexity mouthfeel : light bodied , almost watery , with moderate carbonation drinkability : interesting concept that perhaps goes better with spicy food or , then again , perhaps not'

S"sampled this courtesy of bret27 at the central coast ba gathering last night . thanks a lot bret ! poured into a snifter . appearance : a very small pile of khaki foam is all i got for head off the pour . it quickly dissipated to a thin halo . body is clear , but very dark : deep reddish brown with shades of ruby . looks very syrupy . i do n't see any carbonation . smell : cereal , toasted grains , caramel , bourbon , oak syrup , and brown sugar . very sweet and sugary , but the light toastiness and hints of bourbon do a lot for this smell . not as deep or complex as i had hoped , but unique . taste : brown sugar , caramel , sweet oak and bourbon , a touch of pine , and even ... roasted malt ? lots of residual sugars in here , but it 's less sweet than all other english barleywines i 've had ( many of which i find to be unbearably sweet ) . once again , unique . more complex than the aroma . i dig . mouthfeel : oily , full , gritty , and awesome ! not too hot , not too dry . lightly carbonated , syrupy , and rich . drinkability : english barleywine is certainly not my favorite style , but i can see why this one stands out . i think the sweetness would overwhelm me after a while , but as ~4oz . sample this was great ."

S"nice pour , deep opaque black with an easy , thick creamy head that clings to the sides of the glass . it 's not exactly long-lasting , but it never fully fades ( ends up thin cream layer that 's too thick for a film , but kind of like a like coat of moss or lichens ) . the aroma is a little weak , but roasty . the flavor is as strong as it should be but it dominated and unbalanced by too much burned bitterness . a bit of smokiness lingers underneath . the lack of balance makes this less than a joy to drink , but intriguing at the same time ."

S"pours a jet-black , no light through on this one , with a big , thick , dark caramel brown colored head that just sits there , clinging to the edges of the pint glass . smells of loads of dark baking chocolate , extreme roastiness , coffee , caramel , really intense . as is the flavor . extreeeemely roasty , burnt toast , charred meat , bitter , dark chocolate , cocoa , espresso beans , black licorice/anise , burnt figs , raisins . some hop bitterness in the finish , as well as some alcohol heat . extremely viscous , oily , thick & slick body that completely coats the mouth . perfect amount of carbonation . tons of flavors and depth on this one . tremendous beer . we have a winner . old chub is easily one of my favorite scottish ales , and dale 's pale ale is pretty damn good when i had it on tap too . looks like im gon na have to try their gordon !"

S"from an abita party pack pours to a golden straw color that leaves less than a 1 finger off-white head that does n't last long at all . really does n't look all that different from your standard macro . not a whole lot going on in the nose . some malt can be detected , no hops but maybe a little bit of corn . taste is mainly malt sweetness . this is really hard to describe because on one hand , there 's still not much happening in this area but on the other hand , i find it noticably better than your average light macro . i would n't turn one of these down if offered one , but i just ca n't imagine being the guy who buys a case of this stuff in the first place . mouthfeel is just as light and bland as anything else but still not horrible for a light beer . these go down extremely easy and i can see this maybe being good to have for a tailgating party but not much else . i have to say if you found yourself in such a situation and everyone around you has coors and bud light , etc , abita light might be a pleasant surprise . it is definitely more enjoyable than your typical light macro but sadly this is still just another example of an abita beer that seems geared more towards people who do n't drink craft . for a light beer , not too bad ... but for beer in general , this is nothing i would drink unless i found it left over from a party ..."

S'a golden colored ale ( not a lager , according to the label ) with a perfumy bit of lemon and large fluffy head which settles to a thin collar of foam . this beer has very nice mouthfeel at first , but as the head settles it seems to be a bit thin . very pleasant citric notes with a hint of a buttery flavor . very drinkable for its strength . this beer needs a little more complexity to be called an abbey ale , but it is a pleasant enough quaffer . found quite cheap at $ 3.99 a four-pack .'

S"had on tap at brewery and later in bottle since i liked it so much . -hefeweizen yeah , cloudy gold , not much orange . the banana taste did n't really come through , this hefe has a strong focus on citrus ( lemon-orange , ( apple ? ) ) and has a lot of clove for a hefeweizen , but is noticeably less than a wit . it 's freshness struck me . being use to german hefes which can be months old before they hit my lips , this was a treat to have strait from the vats . in the blazing hot nm sun its focus on citrus rather than banana suits this beer well . the mouthfeel was not as smooth/creamy as other hefes ( high carbonation with a tart sting ) . -i felt like i could drink this stuff as long as the sun was up- so what ten hours -- yeah about 2-3 gallons then ?"

S"thanks to shuajw for this one ! typically , when i decide to review a beer i 'll sit down with it , open up it 's page , pour the beer , and get started . this experience was anything but typical -- i do n't if it was the allure of being the first beer i 've tried courtesy of a trade or simply that i just got back from the gym but i had to get a taste before writing . after pouring terrapin 's india brown ale i had an overwhelming urge to just taste , so i did . and then i had some more ... there 's barely any left . what a beer ! the pour is n't really 'brown ' in color- more so a dark hue of red . a bit of head materializes on the pour and laces decently . it smells so incredibly similar to something i 've had recently i just ca n't put my finger on it . various hops and heavy caramel malt notes smell goood to me . it tastes very sweet and has a long and bitter finish that leaves the taste of hops on the back of your tongue . it 's so balanced though with the caramel malt flavors . mouthfeel is light to medium with moderate carbonation that lent itself to incredible drinkabiility . needless to say , i may be asking for more of this beer quite soon ."

S'appearance : nice jet black color with a decent sized coffee colored head . not my best pour but still built itself up . smell : you can sense the alcohol but it has a nice malty aroma with hints of the licorice that give it almost a bitter scent . taste : the beer is very thick and sweet but really reminds me of the molasses used in the process . the licorice taste combines to create a nice spiciness . drinkability and mouthfeel : very thick with a low carbonation . it adds a good sensation for me but that might not do it for most . interesting take on a stout . i just wish these beers were not so expensive . i love them , but quite the financial burden .'

S"appearance : pours a light amber to golden yellow color . a nice decently thick white head forms about an inch thick . the head nicely laces the glass . smell : for something labeled hop monster this beer 's smell is nothing but unique . what clearly smells to be a tart grapefruit-like juicy and tangy smell complete inhibits my nostrils . more sweet aromas are present with little or no scent of apparant bitterness . taste : initially this beer is quite sweet with a fruity taste which explodes in my mouth halfway through . though this beer is not sour , it is tart and going down , brings out such flavors as fruit , minor alcohol , and something which i can not quite figure out . all of these flavors linger on the palate until another sip is taken and the explosion occurs again . mouthfeel : this beer has minimal carbonation and is not very thick at all . overall it goes down quite quickly but the pungent sweetness is almost too much , but at the same time is just quite amazing ."

S"this beer was brewed as a one-off for the charity event , the philadelphia sessions . they had a firkin available at the event . the brewers said that it was a dipa style . it was a bit cloudy and golden in color with a nice soapy white head on top . the smell was wonderful . it was similar to their philadelphia pale ale in its citrus hop aroma , but the bitterness was amped up . still , it remained well balanced . bready malt undertones . the body was lighter than most other dipas and that certainly helped make this beer easily drinkable . fantastic drinkability , something that yard 's does well ."

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard glass ; no freshness date provided . appearance- 3.5 out of 5 . sapporo pours a bright color of pale golden straw with a similarly bright white head that is surprisingly creamy for a beer this light . it leaves a fair bit of lacing as carbonation rockets through the glass . smell- 3 out of 5 . rice and corn adjuncts dominate the nose along with some other grainy hints . at first whiff , this smells for all the world like a typical american mass-produced pilsner , yet subsequent sniffs bring sweet malt and slightly citrusy hops to the surface . taste- 3 out of 5 . at first , this beer is fairly tasteless aside from being reminiscent of rice with a metallic twang , almost like licking a metal spoon after serving rice with it . there is less corn than american macrobrews of a similar style , but the overall effect is the same ; however , once the beer has been breathing in the glass for a few minutes and has been allowed to warm a little , more flavors develop -- not complex flavors by any means , but they 're still a little different than the standard rice/corn combination . citrus hops struggle to bring a bitter sensation to the back of the tongue , but they ultimately fail and are washed away by the bubbling carbonation . mouthfeel- 3 out of 5 . overall , this beer is light and dry . the carbonation adds an amusing bit of tingle to the feeling , but it goes down easily . drinkability- 4 out of 5 . as with most beers on the light end of the spectrum , sapporo 's drinkability is its highlight . it is a bit more balanced and more drinkable than things like miller high life or pabst blue ribbon , but it is also a little more expensive considering the fact that it has been imported . if you 're an rabid anime fan or japanophile , this is an ideal beer to prove how obsessed you are ; othewise , i suggest opting for a domestic equivalent . on the other hand , taking its japanese origins into account , sapporo is light and subtle enough to compliment fairly delicate foods like sushi without overpowering the flavors as stronger , more blatantly-flavored beers might ."

S"first sip after a really bad poor , woah . i said it out loud . oh this is gon na be a very different beer . pours a very good head . i got the impression that i should pour strongly but apparently this bottle is new enough that i need a slow pour . bottle on 4/19./07 so it 's only about a month old and so i expect this to be a very raw beer . the store was almost out and i 've got 3 more to age so i had to pick it up and try it already . deep ruby color with a creamy thick head . looks very interesting , not a lot of bubbles in the beer . i 'm not sure what to say about the smell . i 'm picking up on alcohol and something sweet but just off . i 'm not impressed . upon second review i think the smell if a mix of the maple and the oak and it just is weird , artificial or something . i think the oak is what 's doing it . odd because their baton burton smelled great . the bottle says it 's smooth and has maple , vanilla and oak in the flavor . the last maple beer i had was poured out so this better be better ! it 's very smooth on first sip . i get a quick maple hit at the front , a smooth flavor that i guess is supposed to be vanilla , and it finishes with a nice oaked flavor ( a bitter one ) . i definitely can taste the alcohol at 11 % and i think i 'm getting raisins which might just be a result of the vanilla and the maple mixing . the alcohol burns a bit going down , definitely a sipper here . as i keep drinking the vanilla start to come out more and maple sort of fades away . if you review taste by complexity this may be the most complex beer i 've ever had ( and i 've had a fair amount of highly reviewed complex beers ) . at the same time some of the flavors just seem off to me . i 'm not sure what to expect in a year once this beer has peaked but i sure as hell want to find out . i keep sipping to try and figure out this beer . i really ca n't tell if i dislike this beer , think it 's average , or just love it . it 's just so different . mouth feel , very very smooth . if you leave it in your mouth and swirled it around the head builds back up and is even smoother . this beer is clearly meant to be a sipper ( i keep saying that because that 's how i 'm gon na judge the scores ) ."

S'exceptional little brew . poured from a 22oz bomber into three different glasses for a tasting between friends . very pretty cloudy orange , mild head that leaves a thick lacing . yeast settles to bottom of cup . the smell is dominated by ginger , with a touch of malt . the flavor is wonderful , a touch of malty sweetness at first followed by the flavors of ginger mostly and a touch of corriander . the wheat flavors run stealthily behind complementing the spices perfectly . a small bite of hops at the end , not very bitter , but with a touch of spice that accents the ginger . unfortunately , as the beer warmed and loss carbonation , the mouthfeel became watery and it the flavors seemed to diminish a little . with fresh bombers i could drink this beer all night , something truly unique .'

S"on tap at hamilton 's the other day . the beer pours a fairly dark brown color with ok head retention and decent lacing . on the nose , however ... jeeze loueeze , i 'd swear i was smelling straight courvoisier . wow . otherwise , this beer is incredibly complex , with aromas of chocolate and vanilla , coupled with the cognac brandy smell . the flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose , except the brandy flavor is a bit more subdued . regardless , as one might expect from green flash , this is a huge , in your face , full bodied , no holds barred , barleywine . there is also some hoppy bitterness on the finish that helps to cut some of the sweetness , along with almost a nutty flavor that adds to the complexity . that being said , i think this beer is just a bit raw at the present time , and really could use a couple of years of aging to mellow out a bit . nevertheless , even now this is an impressive beer , if not exactly a super drinkable one . at present it 's a bit on the boozy side and finishes with some heat . another impressive effort from the folks at green flash . what a surprise . : - )"

S'had a 4oz draft sample of this last night and honestly i can not believe that this was even beer . it more or less tasted like liquified cheesecake or tiramisu . there was a heavy cream taste with strong hints of cocoa and coffee . the alcohol is almost undetectable and the taste really is a lot more like kaluha than anything else . nonetheless this sample was more than enough for i would not want more . it is the a good dessert beer but if anyone can seriously take more than this down they must have a real sweet tooth .'

S"enjoyed out of the bottle while visiting cape cod one thing this brewery does really well is in their marketing ... you can not help but grab this beer without noticing the packaging ... luckily for all of us the beer itself is very good too pours a deep amber nutty color with good off white head did n't get much aroma just a hint of hop spice ... was looking for a malty scent but i did n't find it first thing i noticed was how smooth the beer was ... good lace around the rim of the pint glass as i continued to sip ... excellent hazelnut malt balanced with the subtle , but noticeable , hop backing ... every sip was as good as the last ... before i could offer some to others i noticed they were almost all gone ... not that this beer was forgettable but how amazingly smooth and drinkable it was ... a great session beer bocce ball was in order and i had this fine beer as my partner"

S"pours somewhat hazy , has a golden hue with a small islandy head and thin slowly falling lacing . smell is barely there , light sort of stale malt presence . i smell a tiny bit of herbal hops and a subtle grapefruit pith odor , but very little else . it smells exactly the same as their pa . the hop profile is a tad disappointing . weak , artificial pine notes are somewhat apparent . there is a bitter toffee flavor accompanied by faint unidentifiable citrus notes . goes down somewhat bitter , but there is no indication of this trying to be an ipa . mouthfeel is there , a little syrupy and a fair amount of carbonation for the style . light to medium body . drinkability is solid , goes down easy and does n't fill you up . i am convinced that this is a slightly amped up version of their pa , it tastes almost identical . not sure what the deal is , but i do n't wnat to think of this as an ipa . it could have just been very old , but they only produce 4 firkins at time so i ca n't see it being too old . the name is very deceiving ."

S"dark clear chestnut hue . dogged , pitted dark beige head leaves muddled lace . the aroma is a combination of dry baker 's chocolate , subtle carob and dark lovibond caramel malt with a roasted tinge . trace herbal hop twang . toasty munich malt sweetness upfront in flavor yields to rounded notes of dark chocolate and smooth , perhaps dehusked chocolate malt . surprisingly assertive roasted grain bitterness lends a refreshing , carbonaceous dryness . hop bitterness is appropriately mild , and adequates tapers residual sweetness . understated herbaceous hop flavor darts in late along with hints of cola like caramel . unfortunately thin in overall body like most of saranac 's brews , with a lanky , over attenuated mouthfeel . finishes with wisps of salty , grainy toast , but otherwise clean and abruptly . quite an enjoyable and unique take on the style , with an agreeably pronounced roasted grain presence . if saranac fermented this with their ale yeast , it would surpass their stout in all respects . quaffable , indeed ."

S'this beer pours very dark brown . the head is tan . the head fades very fast leaving almost no laces . it smells quite malty . there is a slight fruity hint to it . it tastes quite malty . there is not much hop balance to it . the lack of hops leaves something to be desired . it is a very smooth beer . quite thin . it in barely carbonated . it could use a little more carbonation . this beer could be a session beer because of the smooth taste and the lack of alcohol . i personally like a stronger more robust and hoppy stout . i will probably not drink that one again , but if you like stouts , definately give this one a try .'

S"the shakespeare stout came in a brown 22oz pop-top bottle with the label silk screened on - a rather dapper lookin ' guy with a feather in his hat on the front . it poured a deep , rich black with a thick dark head that took a few minutes to calm down , then disapeared without leaving a lace of any sort . the first aromas were malts , all the way - then toasted and rosted malts and perhaps a bit of chocolate , a bitter coffee as well . for such a dark , rich stout i was impressed by the way the malts did n't completely overpower and overwhelm me . i enjoyed the heavey mouthfeel - thick , creamy - and after a while noticed that there seemed to be a slight oily coating on my mouth - sounds gross , but actually pleasant as it was flavorful . my one complaint : the 22oz bomber was a bit much at one time and by the end i wished i 'd purchased it in 12 oz bottles . at $ 5.00 a bottle ( in dc ) it is a pricey treat and i was sad to feel full 3/4 of the way through . still , another stellar brew for rogue . feathery foofy hats off to those wonderful folks ."

S"okay , let 's see how well i can remember it . just got back from the pub and it was the last pint that i had , so it should be at the top of my mind . it was a lot different than i expected , with a dunkel , i thought i would be getting sort of a burnt wheat brew but that 's not what i tasted . it pours a solid cloudy brown that 's in motion , if you know what i mean . when it was set down in front of me , there was literally no head , so i 've no judge on that . i could hardly get smell of it either , it smelled like a typical hefe . however , the taste started as a stout but ended as a very citrus hefe . very odd , the citrus was hiding behind a coffee flavor , stark contrast from beginning to end . it felt alright , better than your average brew , which was nice . but was n't the most drinkable . i definitely had to take my time to get through it . not easy going , but i was glad i got through it as it was unique ."

S"bomber provided by sulldaddy . thanks for the opportunity . pours a two-finger tan-orange head over swamp-murky orangish brown liquid . smells piney , grapefruit pith , and pineapple . winterfresh clean , yet sour white grape and sharply dried ragweed . taste starts smooth sweet before a gentle pine-sol jumps in . during the swallow , this changes to a really rough grassy citrus ( potent grapefruit pith with some orange rind ) . the aftertaste reveals that the sour has persisted and it hangs around in the aftertaste for a good long time . beneath the sour , the aftertaste also holds sourish nectarine and aged cherry . sorry , but whatever this hop schedule is , it does n't work for me . keep the pine resin in the forest . man , the head just hung around and hung around . it formed thick coagulated mats of dense foam and left incredible lacing on the inside of the glass . medium-light body ( but creamy smooth ) and moderately carbonated . the carb is sharp and adds an acrid sting on parts of my tongue and the roof of my mouth ( middle of my palette , to be precise ) ."

S"coors light . the silver bullet . so named because drinking this beer is about as pleasurable as being shot in the face . ok , maybe that 's a bit dramatic , but it ai n't good . coors light is the lowest of the low in the category of adjunct lager . it is so hard to believe that these same people brew blue moon , a decent wheat beer . the color is the clearest and lightest yellow possible . the color is discernable but i think mountain dew has more character . the flavor is so lackluster it is almost covered completely by the high carbonation . if you drink it from a can it tastes more like tin than like beer . tastes like some malt syrup mixed with some hop substitute and then watered down with gallons and gallons of cold rocky mountain water . then they threw in a seltzer tablet . this beer is n't for anyone but if you do n't really care for beer , at least you can drink this and it wont have much `` beer '' taste . it is also a good beer when spilling it is a high risk , for example at a concert , or while playing beer pong . do n't sit down with this stuff ."

S"this beer pours an amber brown with a white cascading head . the beer has a nice hop aroma with a bit of sweet malt aroma also smells estery but not that pleasant of esters , smells yeasty ( but is not bottle conditioned ? ) and alcoholic . taste is roasted malts , not as sweet as i thought it would be but it is fairly well hopped so this may skew my perception . nice hoppy aftertaste . alcohol taste is there as well , it could be blended in better , perhaps this beer could have used more aging . probably could n't drink very many of these because of the alcohol content but is a nice sipping brew ."

S'bomber poured into a chimay chalice . a dark caramel/amber color with a slight head . smells sweet and rich.. taste is much of the same . full bodied , very rich , heavy , and malty with a mild hoppy bitterness in the background . alcohol is present but not overwhelming , yet the overall characteristics of this make it a very slow sipper . for this most part , i think this beer is pretty par for the course for the style . a solid offering .'

S"finally got to try the big one . at $ 8.00 for a 12 ounce bottle and 21 % abv , not for the faint of heart . a pretty red/orange color with a medium head that quickly dissipated . all i could smell was sweet fruit and alcohol . the taste followed the odor : sweet , sweet fruit , alcohol , with a hops coming in later . a very thick , rich mouthfeel . i started with it chilled , let it sit , and finished it at room temperature . definitely better at room temperature . i 'd look at this as a dessert beer , and would figure that 6-12 ounces would be my limit ."

S'dark as night with minimal amounts of head that leaves a small lace on the edge of the glass . a strong smell of chocolate and a hint of bitter hops . a balance of malt and hops with this beer and a hint of chocolate in the taste not as strong as the smell . smooth and much lighter than i was expecting it to be . a very approachable porter mild but still with a lot of flavor .'

S"judging from the high ratings and increasing popularity in `` imperial '' and belgian styles , we americans validate a good beer by its specific gravity and abv content . not me . i 'm looking for an old world ( read german/czech ) pilsner . while a good , fortifying drink , prima pils does not come close to being a true pilsner . it 's more american ale than even a lager , let alone a pilsner . this beer 's potential is most likely in its water , as pa is founded on limestone , like northern germany , poland and the czech republic . however , prima 's yeast does not convince me that this drink is bottom fermented . nor does the thick yellow color convince me that this is a pilsner : it 's too malty ; it 's too strong . it 's a good drink , but it 's not subtle and refined like a true pilsner . someday , an american pilsner will come ; it 's not here yet ."

S"a typical pete 's bottle with an old time baseball player on the label . pours a golden yellow with a mostly white head of about a finger 's width . head retention is not stellar , little lace left on the glass . smells like yeast with a hint of citrus , some hop oil underneath . aromatic and inviting . the taste is a good balance of malt , yeast with a clean citrus finish . little to no aftertaste due to the citrus flavoring . mouthfeel is weak , could benefit from more carbonation , but not enough to chew on here . for drinkability i feel it is a little to citrus for a good session . definitely worth a try , but probably a single or double serving at best ."

S"nothing says `` hey it 's october and you should be drinking fall-themed beers , asshole ! '' like a pumpkin beer . so i picked up smashed pumpkin ale from shipyard . i accidentally overchilled it - so serving starts at around 40f and gently warmed to low-60 's by the end of the second glass . no yeast . i 'm always a fan of foil tops , and this gold-foiled cap is no exception , perfectly accenting the orange and gold label . a : pours a sparkling , coppery orange , with a very thin head and thicker collar and a few random bubbles in the middle . tilting the glass leaves legs underneath a sparkling , descending curtain of falling lace . s : wow . that 's a lot of spice , especially considering the cool temperature . let 's play a word association game , shall we ? i 'm going to list all of the words that come to mind as i sniff : pumpkin . ( yeah , i took the easy one . ) anise . nutmeg . licorice . autumn . nutmeg . jack-o-lantern . caramel . cinnamon . cooler weather . munich malt . pumpkin pie . no distinguishable hops . nastier as it warms . more licorice . banana . uncle don getting drunk on pumpkin schnapps during football and puking all over the couch . anger . fucking nutmeg again . betrayal . spiced vomit . ruined holidays . wow , that was fun . i do n't have an uncle don , so i guess somehow this brew is giving me false memory syndrome . t : the taste is exactly what the nose foreshadowed . three major elements are combined here . first , and least noticeable , is the perfect level of hop bitterness , from no distinct hop strain . the hops are most apparent at the finish . secondly , we have plenty of malt features : toast , caramel , biscuit , honey , fresh bread , cloves . lastly , and most distinguishable , are the spices . pick a pumpkin pie spice ; it will be here . this is liquid pumpkin bread . there 's more banana than the nose suggested , but i would n't call this an estery beer . the flavor is better than the smell , but as this beer warms , the spices start getting brutal , and the flavor continues to degrade from drinkable to bad to sickening . near room temperature , it 's just plain awful . m : full-bodied with fair carbonation . creamy . mouthfeel is the only redeeming quality in sp . d : negative score on drinkability . i scowl when someone talks about pouring out beer , but the garbage disposal threatened to eat another spoon if i did n't share the last third of this beer . i saw a jack-o-lantern the other"

S"sam adams `` boston lager '' - reviewed as a vienna lager , 355ml brown bottle , no freshness date . the appearance of a vienna lager is very important to the style - this conforms to a good standard , but is slightly the wrong colour ( a little too pale orange rather than red ) , has adequate but not great head retention , and acceptable lacing . average appearance for the style , but it still looks good in this stemmed grolsch glass . smell is very nice : sweetish honey notes , maybe clove or some other earthy vegetable smell , perhaps citrus as well . complex enough to pull apart into its components ; one of those aromas that hits you as a fine , complex beer smell . taste : the smell sets the beer up to taste fuller than it does . bitter hops , malt , citrus perhaps , but with quite a thin mouthfeel . not the infinite blend of flavours present in some vienna lagers i 've had . a little bit sweet , probably from the choice of malt , and rather bitter . pleasant but definitely nothing special . mouthfeel is too thin for this type of beer . needs more to back it up . carbonation is particularly low , and it shows . however , it is full enough to drink a few of - if i could afford a six of this , i 'd be content drinking it at a party or something . overall , quite nice ."

S"got this on tap @ sunset grill and tap in brighton . poured a deep dark brown with a very small head that simmered into almost no lacing smelled extremely malty and oak-y . extreme malt smells , with some hints of alcohol . hops are practically non-existent tastes great . i do n't have much experience with old ales ( save for ola dubh ) , but i 'd imagine they would taste very similar to this . very , very malty ... probably caramal malts that have turned into a very unique taste with age ... .very very woody , oak-y taste dominates the pallate . no hops here . i liked the old flavor very much . it tastes musty -- like an old attic would smell like ( if you could imagine ) . the 10 % abv is well-hidden by the way mouthfeel was good , a little oily , but i 'd imagine thats what the style is supposed to be drinkability is pretty bad . the beer tastes great , i just could'nt imagine coming back for more ... .especially at 8.99 a 13ouncer overall- i was gon na get this , but at 15 bucks a 4 pack -- i backed off . i had to get it when i saw it on tap . i 'd say definitely get it if you see it on tap , but do n't bother getting a 4 pack ... .unless you love old ales ..."

S'a re-review , in a can . this beer is just a great standby for when you want a cheap , simple beer . yeah , not the greatest , but good . pours a nice head with decent lacing , pure white . try finding another macro that pours like this . smell is grainy . taste is like a macro lager , with a nice finish and perhaps a little bitterness to start . mouthfeel is ok , and the drinkability is very good . i drink this rather than supporting the big 3 when i want something simple .'

S"12 oz bottle pours a dark brownish-red color with a decent crown of cream colored foam . average retention and not much lacing . standard looking brown ale on our hands . nose is a nice complement of nutty , roasty and toasty malts . a faint touch of earthy hops and some doughy yeast round out a little bit of depth . really a great smelling brew , nothing extravagant , but spot on for the style . taste is just mildly sweet with a toasty and hoppy bitter finish . not as much depth as the nose indicates and a bit thin in the mouth , but it is a pretty nice beer and quite drinkable . i can see why this is big sky 's most popular ."

S"appearance - very black , with a large medium-brown head . laces very well . smell - light hop smell with some roastiness that faded as the head went down . taste - not what i was expecting at all . the hop i smelled all but fades away , and there 's a subtle milky flavor mixing in with the roasted malts that are present . slight nuttiness is also present , but nothing overwhelms - if anything , its hard to pick out flavors because they are mostly subtle . mouthfeel - very creamy with a lot of carbonation . drinkability - fairly pleasantly surprised , this is not really what i was expecting . it goes down rather smooth , and does n't really end up with any offensive off flavors at all . the creaminess makes it incredibly drinkable ."

S"thanks to beandip for the bottle via trade ; i only have one more from our interactions & it , too , is a ba barleywine ? coincidence ? i think not . popped open & shared with my florida-bound wife , curse her ! pours is pretty tame . the beer looks like water running of a rusty , fire-engine red 1980 ford pinto . aroma is sharp , malty , with a teaspoon of oxidation & a faint , but present , sourness . does n't bode well . cockeyed cooper carries a whopper of oxidation , enough to really wreck the beer for me . rusted nickel dominates , with only bare hints of vanilla , bourbon , oak , raisins , caramel , & malts peeking out from the ruins . but the slick rust keeps this from being enjoyable at all . disappointing . bottled less than a year ago , this one , anyway , has turned into a heap of pinto scrap metal . my wife concurs . sadly , reluctantly i ca n't finish this ."

S"as a couple others have said , this is by no means the greatest beer in the world . however , it had a couple qualities i really enjoyed . it 's an excellent beer to pair with chinese ( or any type of food really ) . probably a chicken and veggie or lighter meal . also , it had an extremely light , almost sweet taste to it . sort of like a snow pea ( if you can imagine that taste in a beer ) . certainly not a filling beer by any means ... so it would be good if you 're looking for something you can have a few of in an evening . as for negatives ... at first i was n't to pleased with the smell . it 's got a skunky aroma initially . after it breathes for a minute or two , that goes away . overall , it was a win in my book . it 's always at my local hyvee supermarket , and it 's one i 'll certainly give another go ."

S'obtained this bottle from the royal mile whiskies shop in london . a bottle-conditioned ale , its brewed at a small brewpub situated at the moulin hotel in perthshire , where the current brewery believes bonnie prince charlie and mary queen of scots both have passed and enjoyed a refreshing drink -- well , before meeting their fate not unknown ; - ( no trace of fresh information on the bottle itself a : once capping it open , the fierce carbonation forced the beer out just like a disturbbed bottle of champagne so forceful it is i cant stop the action and it jumps into my goblet with a rocky and fluffy beige head which disappears almost in ten seconds ? ! the combination of the action and its very dark-brownish colour makes the beer look rather like a glass of coca-cola pouring some more again , the foam comes out from inside the liquid , with a strong hzzz sound , and disappears in no time~~ looking normal for a coke but quite intriguing and unusual for a beer ... s : profoundly sweetish chocolaty and malty , against a sour fruity ( mixed forest berries ) base and a deeply damp-wood like musty + yeasty note the nearest thing i can relate the distinct sour base to is the refreshingly sour , woody note of flanders red ale , but this one somehow strikes a different tone . t & m : for the first sip the mighty yeast is in action again , pumping into my mouth a lot of fizz and i cant taste much of anything the second sip reveals a flat texture of some dark malts accompanied with a much weaker sourness , which brings with it much less fruitiness as a result . the finish is clean with a dryish and tangy mouthfeel , leaving little aftertaste to enjoy . while the mouthfeel is fizzy , the body is just flat and one-dimensional -- overall quite like fermented juice mixed with watered-down lipton lemon tea left in the air for a while not fresh and not good . d : imo this is a failure any bottle-conditioned beer wishes to avoidthe yeast condition is not right , and perhaps the beer itself is gone or has been dealt with wrongly somehow somewhere during the handling process in any case , id avoid buying this beer again , unless next time theres responsible fresh information on the bottle .'

S'appearance - slightly dark orange beer . thick creamy head like lather is very sticky , leaving a thin blanket of lace behind . aroma - frangrant - orangey , piny , some malt aroma fighting through the intense hop nose as well . taste - good malt presence . sharp bitter hops , combined with a high alcohol level , make a hot and harsh impact on the palate . feels raw and boozy , needs more taste and less hootch . too medicinal , but getting in some of the bottom sediment from the bomber gives it a needed boost of sweetness . completely stands up to some spicy tamales as expected . letting it warm up helps balance-wise . the ups and downs kind of cancel each other out on this one , leaving me with an impression more of the downs . mouthfeel - nicely smooth and creamy , leaves a pleasant residual to help fight off that alcohol burn . drinkability - too mixed up for me to get into and enjoy .'

S'poured a very cloudy pale straw . dense two finger head shows decent retention , but low lacing . pungent medicinal/phenolic smell overpowers any other aroma , reminicant of play doh . the taste is very different , but also becomes unpleasent . a hefe type yeast and gentle floral hop notes upfront , then a mellow wheat flavor . the aftertaste explodes with a simple banana flavor that is niether dry nor residual , just stubborn . medium carbonation and light body . the phenol presence is appropriate to style but totally overkill and ruins a potentialy smooth and drinkable beer with an unbalanced taste , cloying mouthfeel and harsh finish .'

S"i picked this one up on a whim , and i have to admit that i am not disappointed . a reasonably priced dipa that delivers . granted , i 'm not going to compare it to the likes of a hopslam or anything , but solid enough - almost 4s across the board . poured from the bottle into a trusty pint glass . appearance : nice copppery color with a hint of amber in there as well . about a 1/2 finger head that disappeared pretty quickly but left a moderate lacing and oily residue on the side . beer appears cloudy with a lot of sediment bubbling throughout . smell : a little floral/piney , but nothing especially bitter coming out of it . slightly sweet honey-esque/malty sweetness eminating from it and just a whiff of alcohol coming out of it too . taste : nice , hoppy and pleasantly balanced by that sweetness alluded to above . alcohol is failry present , perhaps a little more so than i prefer as it started to become a little more dominant as i worked my way down the glass . mouthfeel : sticky , dries a bit as well after the alcohol passes but still leaves a slight film on the palate as well . about what i would expect . drinkability : moderate - this is a fine dipa but the alcohol is a little high in this style , so i do n't think i 'd want to sit through more than a couple , and i 'm not as tempted to want to as i would be with some other dipas ."

S'it has arrived . a frightening beer for the autumn season . on the label is a picture of a wide-eyed , snarling man with pointy teeth and pointy ears . he has his head turned with a glaring look like we just snuck-up behind him and sent a shock of fear down his spine . the background has a picture of a sky-scraper pointed at an eclipsed sun . i find the vampire much more frightening than the gargoyle . appearance : translucent amber . strong lacing with a creamy beige head speckled with medium sized bubbles . smell : hops , a little vanilla/caramel oak along with the over-ripe fruit/ raison thing . taste : great balance between the malt and hops . rich complex flavor with lots to pull out from the abundance of hops . starts off bitter when served cold but becomes very pleasant after it warms . a creamy aspect emerges with the change in temperature . not the nitro-can creamy but the savory flavor kind of creamy . the 8.0 % abv is hidden . be careful you dont have too many or you may be overcome with vampire like cravings for more beer . mouthfeel : fine . i didnt have any problems biting into this voluptuous ale . drinkability : top notch . i sampled this on a saturday afternoon while watching the local college team teach a lesson to some kids from a carolina ( again , way to go nuge . ) i finished the four-pack with ease and craved for more . great lakes nosferatu is an incredibly balanced , smooth , strong ale .'

S'poured into a pint . a : dark golden ( if that makes sense ) . pretty heavy carbonation pours into a 2 finger , white , foamy head . carbonation continues to rise , as the head lingers . . . and very slowly settles leaving a nice little blanket to keep the beer snuggly . nice spider web lacing remains as you drink . s : malt , hops , lemon , and a bit of honey . . . maybe a hint of apple , as well . t : sharp hops with citrus hints . m : light and hoppy . as a matter of fact , the hops are quite prominent and remain throughout the experience . a lemony twang kicks in , too . does have a slightly watery feel . dry finish . d : very good drinkability . light feel , refreshing body , good flavor . this beer has a really nice atmosphere which pleasantly surprised me . i am a big abita fan - although i recognize there are no world beaters here - but they general lack in this department . good flavor , sharp , but not overwhelmingly so . nice light body , good aftertaste . makes for really good drinkability . very good , quaff .'

S'light beer but surprisingly heavy body . strange thick malt liquor taste , but very low alcohol . bitterness seems to be missing , though there is a touch of dirty cardboard that might be hops . looks nice , pleasant head , all the elements of beeriness . just very sweet with no redeeming flavors . the stuff is drinkable enough , apparently clean tastes , but i have to mark it down as a poor representative of this category . personally i think we need an international adjunct lager category for these low-rent specimens . in the interest of research i gave a 21 year old female a couple of glugs , and she liked it . but then she thinks olympia is too hoppy .'

S'pours very light golden color with nice clarity . head is nice at first but dissipates quickly . appearance is perhaps the best feature of this beer . nose is very , very subdued with a clean grain/malty/toasty component . on the palate the lightness in flavor is the most noticeable feature , with a constant struggle to enjoy the malt even though it is very cereal & grain like in flavor . the beer appears overly carbonated , but perhaps that is because the palate focuses on this due to there being nothing else worthy of attention . watery , light finish . not offensive , but not inspiring in the least . would prefer water without the calories .'

S"i 'm a beer fan as money permits . when i 'm being cheap , this is a good beer for the money . it can also be difficult to find anything i 'm looking for in the great black swamp of ohio . molson canadian is considered exotic to most people here . miller lite is always in my fridge as a backup . i ca n't speak much to its appearance since i generally drink it straight from the can . the smell , based on years of american beer drinking , is what a good american macro should smell like . a little sweet and malty . the taste is consistent , i 've never found a skunky can in my many years of research . it 's flavor is a little to the sweet side , but not overpowering . like many american food products , it has a distinctive flavor , but is bland enough to appeal to the masses . it 's mouthfeel is not too different from carbonated water , maybe a little thicker . drinkability is good , maybe too good . i could easily drink one every 15 minutes if i 'm not pacing myself . it goes down very smooth . this beer is nothing great , but it 's not too bad either ."

S"the bottle gave a forceful pop upon opening it . that being said , the head was immediate and gargantuan atop a hazy amber . retention was equally as impressive , leaving a lumpy cone on the way down . the nose was full of lemon citrus , quite distracting as i searched for other flavors within it . alcohol and sour apple cider was pretty much what i smelled . the flavor carried on about the same profile . apple juice and lemony sourness was too much . carbonation was over the top and it just seemed off ... . hopefully this was a tainted beer because it was n't any good . i dumped it after two sips . i know of no reason why this beer would or could have gone bad , certainly not after i had obtained it . therefore i will not be touching this one in the future ."

S"reviewed from notes pours light colored and murky , i never would have guessed this was a barleywine . the aroma does n't give anything away either , as it is mostly light bready malts and some floral and citrus hops . the taste once again is nothing like a barleywine . normally i would just assume that this was miscategorized on ba , but it says right on the bottle that this is a `` barleywine ale '' ... .a pretty poor attempt at one really , but judged on its own merits rather than that of the style it is still fairly drinkable and light with a decent sweet malt base and some unfortunately muted hops . really tough to rate this one ... according to style it is an f , but on its own it is probably a b- or c+ ... .i think i 'll go with something in between ."

S'golden and amber in color with a slight white head . a flowery aroma with a hint of flour . smells of hops , slight citrus , and the familiar alcohol scent that you get with a tripel . first taste , the citrus/ lemon comes to the forefront of the palate . second was the dominant alcohol . third taste was a bit tart , similar to a belgian sour beer . from then on the taste was tart to alcohol . decent beer . complex tastes , smells , the challenge is of the overpowering alcohol , thus the lower mouthfeel and drinkability .'

S"pint glass from pint bottle . pours yellow-brown and crystal clear with a thin head leaving medium lacing . the aroma is faintly straw or hay and toasted , with overtones of honey and clover . a strong barley flavor is supported by faint sweetness . the bitterness is mild and quite hoppy ; the colder this is served , the better . the whole flavor is warmly toasted and quite round . this is very full in the mouth for a lager , and has a tingly but even carbonation . this is one of the best lagers i 've ever had ; something like radegast , which i 'm told is named for the ancient slavic god of grains & brewing , is everything that a budweiser or for that matter a budvar , hopes to be and never can be . this and eggenberg 's lager are my two favorite lagers overall , and bring credit to a style that has known far too much shame these past few years ."

S"this clearly is going for the lighter end of the porter spectrum -- a colorado interpretation of a brown porter that is marred by a too-forward bitterness and watery flavors . dark brown in color with ruby-ish highlights when held to the light and a persistent , fizzy and clumpy off-white head that recedes to a 1/4 '' crown above the beer . aromas are faint hints of coffee , maple , and cola . watery flavors imbalanced by a biting hop finish . like aromas , the flavors are faint : there 's a bit of licorice , some cola , and a very faint hint of coffee or chicory at the end of each swig . the flavors are muted by the watery mouthfeel and bitter aftertaste that takes hold of the beer about halfway across the tongue . where is the caramel , nuttiness , or toffee flavor ? ska 's misfired with this one : skip it and do n't look back"

S"a new beer sunday review . eleagant afternoon of slumming ; after a great night of flip cup using yankee jim honey lager , and a walkerville blonde at one point out of coinicidence . bet that 's the first time a walkerville product made its way into game of flip cup . now here , just kickin back with some chips , brew and some major league baseball . in my glass - lakeport ice . ( *5.5 % abv ) poured like the nectar of the gods as it appears ; an almost transparent liquid that then turns a heavy golden hue in the tall glass . big , big beautiful inch and a half head on it that lasted quite a while , later retiring to a quarter inch head that stayed with the brew and left a big frothy mocha like lacing on the inside of the glass . aroma is of some very , very light roasted malts with a nice cascade hop aroma . good balance , but a plus as well to see the hops really coming out to play unexpectadily . taste ? not too bad , not too bad at all . nice tingling mouthfeel from the hops - and thankfully no wild carbonation pricking at my tongue . crisp , clean ; very fresh - for a cheap lager , it gets points for some clearly added extra efforts . mouthfeel is very enjoyable - love them hops ! very , very peculiar though that i 'm not picking up on a mettalic mouthfeel out of the can as i once did out of the bottle - perhaps its finished ? they read up , they did their homework and they fixed the problem ! i 'm just guessing , but my hat goes off to them as the once horrid mettalic mouthfeel is nowhere to be found - welcome to my fridge and body lakeport ice ! i 'm impressed - quite tasty , quaffable and affordable at 12 cans for about 15 bucks . good beer ."

S"poured into a pint glass from a 22 oz . bomber . the pour is a somewhat hazy amber with a tall white head . retention is decent , as is lacing . i did n't really know what to expect in the nose , having never tried a smoked beer , but i was surprised . it smelled to me just like smoked bacon or ham with maple flavouring . the taste is more of the same . there is just the slightest hint of chocolate in the background . a nice bitterness is present throughout . mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a lot of carbonation . drinkability suffers a bit since it makes me feel as if i 'm eating meat , not drinking a beer that tastes like meat . i 'm glad it 's been a while since i ate , or i would n't be able to finish the bomber . if this is a good starter smoked beer , i 'd like to try a more advanced version . it might be fun to revisit this every now and then , though ."

S"this one poured a light yellow with a small head and then there was no lacing . the smell was like fresh in your face hops , which really does not do it for me . the initial taste is full of hops flavor but then a terrible mid-taste like metal rears it 's ugly face and then the after taste is kind of clean and crisp . i do n't know how i am going to drink the rest of these in my variety case . the mouthfeels is average , which is the only average aspect about this beer . i would not recommend this beer unless , you like hoppy/metal flavored beer . there is a possibility for this beer to be good , but erie needs to get rid of the metal taste ."

S"imperial ipas are one of my favorite styles ... and victory is an excellent brewery , so when i saw the hop wallop for sale i was extremely excited . unfortunately , this is the worst iipa i have ever had ! the entire problem with the beer lies in the total lack of any malt flavor . the beer is yellow and fizzy , like a german lager . i do n't know how they got 8.5 % abv in this thing , because malt-wise , this tastes like a strong pilsener . even in very blonde iipa 's i 've had ( the blonde hop monster from paper city comes to mind ) , there was a very solid , if simple , sweetness to it , to balance out the hops . this beer had nothing of the sort . on the bittering front , yes this is very bitter , but lacks the serious hop complexity of the better iipas such as the 90 minute ipa and the ruination . incredibly dissapointing . i 'll stick with the storm king and the hop devil when i am choosing victory brews ."

S"pours a pale straw color , nearly golden , very clear with just a little chill haze . pours with a very thin head , loose bubbles , and it all clears quickly with minimal lacing . the smell is of faintly sweet malts , a little hint of commercial apple juice , a tiny tanginess , with just a bit of a hop presence , herbal , faintly citrusy and resinousy . you are n't supposed to be overwhelmed by this style , but this one does a bit more than i 'd expect . the taste is crisp , starts sweet , with light maltiness , then an spicy sort of minty hop flavor in the middle , with a dry finish . kind of tart and grainy , with a hint of fruitiness . just what i 'd expect . the carbonation is just a bit prickly , it is n't the fullest , but what should expect . you actually get a faint feeling from the resinous hops . this one goes down smoothly , with the only turn-off being the carbonation . i would recommend it to anyone looking for something to drink for a long session ."

S'picked this up over christmas while in johnson city , tn at the libation station . poured a nice looking , 2f head but no lacing . brown & burgundy in color , as expected . smell had some sweet fruits , spice , and a touch of honey , but pretty tame . ok flavor , malty , with light citrus - nothing offensive to bring it below a 3 . mouthfeel was the most disappointing part - it was thin and watery , and a little fizzy . not what i would expect from a solid scottish ale . pretty easy drinking overall , but the watery character was a bit of a turn-off . i would still recommend this for a macro-fan who would be willing to kick it up a notch .'

S'i enjoyed this beer in the brewery restaurant served in a tulip glass . appearance - a lovely deep amber almost burgandy color with no head to speak of . smell - the alcohol smell is fainter than i would expect , masked by sweet molasses and honey odors . there is a slight oak smell as well . taste - the beer is very sweet , a caramel flavor dominates . not a hint of hops or traditional malty tones . has a light vanilla flavor and very faint spicy tone , perhaps cloves or allspice . despite the 12 abv , the alcohol flavor was very well masked by the sweetness . mouthfeel - thick and smooth , but only to the extent of what one would expect from a quadruple . not very refreshing . drinkabilty - by far the worst aspect of the beer . my first sips were very good to me . then our food arrived . i made a big mistake in ignoring the food pairing recommendations , but i really had to try the v-12 . i found its character clashed very harshly with my dinner ( a bruschetta pizza ) . the beer actually became very difficult to drink toward the bottom . this is not just a mistake i made however that tainted the rating , its flavor is too overpowering to be paired with almost any food . by itself , it does make a decent desert beer . even without food pairing problems , at 12 abv the 750ml is a formidable task for anyone .'

S"that wax was a really really really dumb idea . just a pain in the ass , nothing else . the bottles looks horrendous anyway , so there goes the `` classy presentation '' part . poured into a wine glass . the beer is deep garnet colored with a good clarity . initially a light brown colored head of moderate size formed , but it fell soon into a persistent ring . the aroma is quite funky , if not sufficiently strong : street dog just back from the sewer , soft oak , and generally sour ( acetic ) . other notes ? i 'll put them under the red wine umbrella , about which i do n't know anything ! the sour notes in the taste are stronger than i expected . the impression i got from the forums was that this beer was more about the brettnomyces and not about the tartness . having tasted it earlier and today , i think that it is sufficiently sour , but of course not intensely so . the mouthfeel , however , is flawed in my opinion . for a beer that tastes as tannic as this one when warm , the body has to be bigger . the red wine notes really come through with temperature . generally dark and tart , five delivers what it promises ; but is it great ? hardly so . for a brewery that makes beers like furious and darkness , yeah , five is bit of a letdown . for a first effort , it 's pretty good . i sincerely wish surly the best with their next sour . 4 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 4"

S"appearance : pours a pale orangey amber hue topped with a thin white head . smell : a remote malt scent blended with buttery diacetyl and an underlieing grassy hop aroma . taste : pretty even-steven between the malts and hops , but both particularly muted , weak even . vague hints of biscuits , toffee , and an herbal bitterness . this beer finishes dry and crisp . there 's an ever increasing peppery taste as time goes on . mouthfeel : its thin and unsubstantial on the palate . this makes for a disappointment in the mouthfeel department . drinkability : its light ( almost lite ) and therefore easily drinkable , but this is n't a beer i believe i 'll be returning to in the future ."

S"pours from a fresh growler a nice apricot amber , slightly hazy , with a foamy eggshell head like the dollop of froth on top of a good latte . it leaves lace in small but thick chunks ; no bubbles are visible rising . smooth , slightly buttery caramel malts and a caress of tight hops in the nose - quite proper for an american interpretation - i chose the bitter because the style typically make awesome session brews . this has 4.5 % abv and an inviting , unintimidating scent . the hops in this batch are definitely spot on - their presence is exquisitely balanced , and their fuggleness is distinctive . this beer has a blend of hops , and i really like it , because i can taste the fuggles as well as the kent goldings , and they combine to be a bit more creamy and full-flavored than fuggles would by themselves . of course , being a bitter , this beer is n't all that hoppy by most standards - the hops just happen to be right to balance the malts , a creamy caramel with very slight zips of lemon peel and a bready finish . the mouthfeel begins each gulp with a smooth , slightly oily caress highlighted with just a tad of swishiness from the carbonation . the finish is slightly dry and warm with alcohol , and a sticky , delicious malty finish hangs around after swallowing , asking for a fresh sip . i went over to port townsend to pick up a growler of a sessionable beer , and i think i deserve a pat on the back for my choice . incredibly drinkable . if my roommate does n't get in here quick to accept my offer of sharing , i 'm liable to finish the growller myself soon ."

S"this beer has a very nice amber color , and was only docked points because of the near complete lack of head/retention . that being said the beer tasted very malty and was n't lacking in carbonation ; it has an almost sour taste along with the crystal malt flavor . it is very typical for the style , but is well done , and as such for the price is as good of a marzen as you could find . very drinkable , and nice mouthfeel , certainly is smooth enough . solid example of the octoberfest style ."

S"12oz bottle served in a snifter . popping the top on this beer illicits a suprising pop and gun smoke for a beer of this abv . usually i expect them to be rather limp , at least in the carbonation department , but not this time ... which follows suit on the pour , when a copper orange beer , with a slight haze , comes to rest in the glass with a finger or two of off-white head . it does dissipate quickly , but it leaves a nice halo and film of bubbles on the top of the beer for a while . quite attractive . taking a deep sniff brings up some pleasent stuff ... a strong sweet malt/alcohol smell with just enough orange citrus hop presence to give it some balance . also slightly peppery . smells pretty good . but then the taste ... pretty good too ? no . much better . the very first taste you get from this is a strong candy sweetness on the tip of the tongue . as it moves further back , a subtle pepper and herb taste with a bit of saltiness spreads slow over the middle . as the beer hits the back of the mouth a nice floral and orange citrus hop flavor makes itself known , mixing in with the sweetness rather than overpowering it . after the swallow both flavors stay for a long time , leaving the mouth with an orange candy finish as the abv goes to work as your throat tingles and your cheeks warm up . mouthfeel is nicely slick and creamy , helping all of this flavor stick to your mouth . i must say , this is a disturbingly well-balanced beer for how hugely powerful it is . i could , if i did n't know better , finish this off pretty quick , only to find myself planted to the floor , most likely . i really like this ... though it is not something i would drink more than one of ( which is why i ding the drinkability ) or buy that often ( dollar/oz ratio is a bit rough and i 'm not out to get drunk ) but yeah , i 'm very glad that i tried it ."

S'i had looked forward to this for quite a while , but it was somewhat disappointing . poured an oily jet black , as i expected , with dark tan head that lingered and left good lacing . aroma was a very malty , very sweet mixture of molasses , chocolate and roasted nuts . flavor was more of the same , although all the flavors seemed to be rolled into one thick syrupy sweet mix . finish was much too sweet as well . the surprising thing in this drink is that even at 18 % abv , i didnt notice the alcohol much in either the nose or taste . unfortunately , i could have used it to be there a little more , just to cut thru some of the syrupy sugar .'

S"i bought a bottle of rich 's rye today for $ 1.79 at the lager mill . i have n't had anything hoppy in a little while so since the label says it 's a super hopped golden rye beer i hope it will quench my thirst for hops . no visible bottling date but i know it 's a fresh 2011 vintage . poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a pint glass . a- the label on this beer is pretty simple , just a picture of a mans face , to me it looks like maury povich . it poured a nice looking golden yellow color just like the bottle stated . it had two fingers worth of white head that died down to a thin layer that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of lacing . s- the aroma is pretty much a half and half mixture of rye and hops . the rye has an earthy grainy aroma with a little bit of signature rye spice . the hops are slightly floral but the citrus hops shine through the most in the aroma . there was also some grapefruit and pine aromas along with a slight bit of pineapple . i like the way that the fruity aromas blend with the heavy rye presence in this beer . t- the flavor of this beer is pretty much dominated by the rye . all those earthy and spicy flavors that you get from beers that are heavy on the rye are present and pretty much make up the majority of the taste of this beer . the hops are a lot lighter then i expected and only impart a very slight floral and citrus taste that is pretty easy to miss . the aftertaste was pretty damn bitter , much more bitter then i was expecting , it seems like the hops were used more for it 's bitterness and aroma than it 's flavor . m- slightly crisp , medium bodied and medium carbonation , i would like a little more carbonation but i 'm not going to bitch about it . overall i thought this was a pretty lack luster beer . i knew going in to this that it was a rye beer , i just was n't expecting the rye to be that bold and dominating , i did n't hate all that rye but it could have been toned down a little . the hops imparted lots of nice aromas but when it came to the flavor all it did was add a really heavy imperial pilsner like bitterness to it that i thought was way too much for this beer . i do n't think i would purchase this beer again it just really did n't do it for me . if you are a die hard rye fan you may want to seek this out but other then that it does n't have much going"

S"appearnce : poured a medium copper with a huge creamy foamy near white head . smell : the smell has an odd fruity , spicy flavor to it , mixed with sweet and wood notes . taste and mouthfeel : not as alive as the smell , but much more well rounded . the malts are incredibly sticky sweet , balance the alcohol well , and the hops are smooth and not out of control at all . some wood and caramel notes are present but not focused . the mouthfeel is creamy and rich . drinkability and overall : the only thing that hurts the drinkability on this one is the alcohol presence in the belly . it 's a suprise . other than that , this is a pretty killer beer . one of the best from lagunitas i 've had . thanks to gclarkage for the bottle ! !"

S"consumed at the tasting we had on 7/25/09-7/26/09 . thanks carlos ! 07/08 batch . the beer appears bloody crimson with a one finger off white head . the aroma is of plastic , chlorine , and plum , with lots of sugar . other notes are of bready malt , oak , tannins , prunes , and cocoa ... but i ca n't get past this really unpleasant plastic . there are also some rather unpleasant metallic notes . the flavor is metal at war with plastic while dark fruits skirmish with brett . i did my best to get past the unpleasantness and analyze the deeper beer beneath the flaws . i found some cocoa and prunes , and then i gave up . other notes are of chlorine , plastic , and metal . there 's far too much metal , and i like metal . the finish has a terribly unpleasant level of astringency that lingers with the plastic and metal ."

S"12oz bottle into a pint glass . pours a tangerine like copper color with a two finger white head . great retention and very nice lacing . smell is solid . some hints of grapefruit and bready malt . taste is well balanced . the juicy hops are on the backend of sweet malts . more aromatic and flavorful than bitter , this is a very delicate ipa . overall , i was impressed with this beer . not a hophead 's ipa , but a very well done and highly drinkable version ."

S'received in a pint glass a very clear apple cider amber full of tiny streams of bubbles and topped with a pinky-thick soda-pop fizz head that faded after a few moments but managed to leave soft curves of lacing . sweet , honeyish malts , muted floral hops ; pale ale thru-n-thru . honey , slightly citric flavors ; gently piney hops balance . little to say except that this was tasty , had a nice body , and was unoffensive . very pleasant to drink , a good session beer or with food .'

S"let me start by saying this beer ( this batch , at least ) is a pain in the ass to pour into a pint glass . as soon as the first drop hint my perfect pint glass foam shot strait up . it literally took me 8 minutes to pour the whole thing in the bottle . this was the first beer that i had to eat the foam and spit it in the sink ( it was bitter and not nice ) just to get to the damn beer . ok , now that we 're past that this is actually a decent looking beer . black with ruby highlights and a light brown rocky head that sticks to the sides of the glass . the smell is of bitter chocolate and roasted grains . tastewise there 's more of the chocolate and dark grains with almost a lactose-like sweetness . it 's a bit astringent and does n't really make me beg for another drink . however , once all that pent-up carbonation got released from the pour the mouthfeel is pretty decent and smooth . the lingering roastedness/astringency kind of turns me off but i will most likely try this again in the future ."

( gluek ) the beer poured a crisp golden color with a small collar of foam that collapsed upon itself so quickly that i was unable to establish a color for it . there are several streams of very large co bubbles eminating from the bottom of the glass and a haze of coagulated protien ( i hope ! ) suspended throughout this beer . the nose is as fake as most of the female breasts in orange county ... part almond , part honey , part putrid ... and that is with me keeping an open mind . i believe i made something that smelled this way with my chemistry set when i was 10 or 11 years old . the taste is just as bad as the nose , although i was able to detect a teeny bit of malt ... i think . forget the mouthfeel and drinkability as this is a drainpour and a genuine waste of a newly scrubbed beer-clean glass ."

S"second pilsner of the evening , but hell , even though its january , its going up to 50 degrees f tomorrow in minnesota ... clear straw color with a big fluffy head that spirals down to delicate lace but keeps a 1/8 inch layer in a pilsner glass as well . very faint hoppy and peppery aroma . plenty of carbonation is noticeable early , works with the subtle malt to give a dry impression . some sense of toasted biscuit mid mouth . finishes softly , less carbonated ( thankfully not fizzy -- the bane of drinkability ) , little aftertaste . a million miles from a `` big beer '' but there 's a quaffability here ."

S"heineken light . well , the only thing i can say that heineken light is not a man 's beer . probably one of the least alcohol infused beers on the market . i bought a 12 pack the other day because it was on special . i sat down and ravaged the fridge pack with extreme ease . the taste is pretty non existent . a decent beer if you are trying to utterly demolish mass quantities of watery , overpriced 3 % alcohol cocktails . extremely easy to drink , and i am upset that pharell williams drops his beats during heineken light commercials . *sigh"

S"well , i had this awesome review written last night , but i was over my limit . so , i am going to try to write a good one again . i got one word for this beer . rich . when i smelled it , it smelled like a deep dark chocolate brew . also , when i poured it out , there was a chocolatey syrup on the bottom , so i poured a little back in to get it off the bottom . with all this going on , i totally expected a rich chocolatey brew . what i got was something different . it tasted like a mix of burnt coffe and maple syrup , mixed with a very earth flavor . it left a really long ring around the glass , like a good wine ( forgot what the term was ) . even though the taste was pretty strange , it had some great characteristics . the color of the beer was nice and dark , which i really like . the beer itself , was quite smooth and coated your throat , so it probably would be a good cough syrup . another thing i liked about it , was that when i drank it , i grew like 20 more chest hairs . but seriously , i am going to save the other half of it for later , and let it age some . well , this was n't the same review as before , just tag it a tribute to the greatest review in the world . salud !"

S"i bought two of these bottles to commemorate the passing of my own dog , a 13 year old german shepard . pours out a deep ruddy amber color , with a huge massive head . i literally set the bottle cap down on top of the head , and it stayed , very impressive . smell is complex , hop forward , with a big malt backbone , did i mention complex ? sweet , with an upfront bitterness . some dark sugar flavors , more complexity that i ca n't put my finger on . i can tell you this ... its great ! thick and smooth like my shepard 's fur , dark like her too . this was a perfect choice , i am enjoying this while fondly remembering my sophie girl ."

S"on-tap at sunset grill + tap into a 5oz tasting flute . a : the body is jet black with just the faintest hints of dark copper highlights , and ( thankfully ) sports a thin but distinct head of ultra-fine tan bubbles . a ring sticks around for the duration , and leaves some light lacing . nice . s : strong bourbon , oak , vanilla , maple , caramelized fruit , and some booze . intense , yet surprisingly balanced . t : starts out with straight whiskey , then soon becomes redolent of deep , rich , sweet malts . the interplay of oaky vanilla and fruity , caramel malt is intoxicating ( both literally and figuratively ) . the downside is a hugely boozy finish , but it 's hard to complain too much when the beer 's 12 % . quite tasty . m : sticky and medium bodied with moderate , fine carbonation . fine . d : five ounces is plenty ( especially in a flight with other big beers ) . notes : i had this as part of a flight that included double crooked tree , allagash ba black , and pch mortel . all were delicious , but this one stood out for being ( surprisingly ) the most balanced . it was n't quite the blast of crazy huge syrupy flavor that i remember the brandy version being , but it 's a massive and delicious beer in its own right . i 'd love to try the grand cru . cheers !"

S'i will be rating this beer probably higher than the average ba . poured from the bottle a dull amber to dark orange color with a thick rocky head that receded slowly and left nice laicing on the glass . smell is wonderful for a red ale pine and grassy hops mixed with tropical fruit notes . taste is so complex for such a simple low abv beer . hops up front fresh cut grass and sour apple with a malty middle that has a dry hoppy finish . mouthfeel is light and dry not too heavy like some red ales are , good carbonation that brings out the hop . drinkability is fantastic and for a low abv this is a great session beer for hop lovers !'

S"nice cloudy appearance , almost opaque , with a healthy off-white head that just sits defiantly . pale orange-yellow in colour , ca n't see any carbonation and does n't really leave lace from the head , although forms sheets of clingy foam further down the glass . looks very pleasant . nose is pleasant , organic and spicy . big overripe banana whiff and a vibrant peppery aroma as well . hints of cumin , fennel and clove are evident in what is really a dominating spicy nose . slightly tart fruit characters are relegated but present enough to lend some buoyancy to the proceedings . taste has a remarkably weizeny character at first , with a piquant clove blending with sweet banana flavours on the front . mid-palate starts to turn sour , with an earthy funk character that seeps through with elements of white wine vinegar , green vegetables and a mild soil character . finish is reasonably long , with some nice organic bitterness lingering towards the back , quite clean and leaves an enjoyable aftertaste . mouthfeel is foamy and slightly chewy , does feel thin at first but there 's enough going on to lower the care factor about it . this is a crisp , enjoyable brew , slightly lacking on the complexity front but very smooth and drinkable as a result ."

S"big and bold , this beer probably has the most sheer depth of any i 've had . pours a medium to dark brown with reddish highlights . carbonation is intact and laces well . looks sort of cloudy , but i think it 's just really thick . the flavors have everything from malt , milk chocolate and coffee to toffee pudding , brandy or rum , raisins and even some tropical pineapple/citrus hops . every sip reveals something new ! mouthfeel is thick , which is just fine for a brew like this , especially on a cool evening . the rub is that while this beer has some amazing flavors ... it 's drinkability is pretty low . often i 'll take forever to finish one and on a few occasions i ca n't . there 's just something very potent about it , and i do n't mean booziness . it 's almost just a little too concentrated . still , split a bottle with someone and you 'll love it !"

S"presented in a 750ml bottle with no freshness or bottled-on date , the bottle proclaims this to be an abbey-style tripel brewed with a boatload of hops . specifically , it is brewed with tomahawk , amarillo , and saaz hops . served in an ommegang chalice . houblon pours a bright golden color topped by a white head two fingers thick . the foam is sticky and fluffy , with excellent retention , and it leaves lacing all down the glass the entire time . there is a slow steady stream of tiny bubbles for the entire duration , and plenty of yeast particles once i get to the bottom third of the bottle . the aroma is very much dominated by the saaz hop strain . lots of lemon peel/lemon zest hop aroma here , which is nicely greeted by some fruity malty belgian tripel goodness . there 's a bit of saison-esque yeast funk , and more bright , flowery hop aromas . this beer really smells quite outstanding . unfortunately , the flavors do not quite live up to the aroma . i am smelling some sort of weird ( but appetizing ) cross between a german pilsner and a belgian triple , but i am tasting some sort of weird ( and less appetizing ) cross between an imperial pilsner , an ipa , and champagne . the booze hits the tongue right away , which is most unwelcome in an ipa of any type , and only acceptable for the freshest tripels . to be fair , i do not know how fresh this is , maybe it just has n't had enough time to calm down , but beer imported from belgium should not taste this hot by the time it gets here . the hops are also markedly more bitter on the tongue than they were in the nose , like too-ripe lemons , and not as flowery as i was expecting . the beer is also extremely dry , though the mouthfeel is right on par for a tripel . i was beginning to hope that maybe , just maybe , i had finally found a belgian ipa that could stand up to the majesty of piraat . alas , it does not taste like it smells ."

S'12oz bottle aged for about 9-10 months . a -- dark black..tan head with reddish hues throughout.. s -- cherry and roasted malts ... espresso.. t -- tart cherry that has calmed down quite a bit from when it was fresh..light coffee and roasted flavors.. m -- smooth carbonation spreads cherry flavor over tounge ... crisp coffee like flavor follows which sort of cleans the palate for the next sip . d -- cant taste the alcohol so be careful ... can catch up to ya quickly.. not one of my all time favs.. but still really good ... a great change after most stouts ... refreshing and vibrant with cherry ... great if you love cherries..'

S"12 oz bottle . pours a deep mahogony with no real head . some sign of lacing on the glass . aroma of malt is about all you can detect , no noticable hop aroma . moderatly carbonated , and you can taste the malt , and again no hopiness . lacks any body , and finishes weakly , but it still tastes good . i would n't go out of my way to get this but would n't pass it up if offered ."

S"review from beeradvocate magazine march 2007 . first created and made popular by dann paquette back in 2004 , leatherlips ipa is a great example of a brewer packing hops into a highly drinkable beer without feel- ing the need to make it 10 percent abv . the recipe lives on at this brewpub , and its new brewer , steve bernard , has taken it to the next level by bottling and distribut- ing it . deep and vibrant golden color shows a really good clarity ; we opted to leave the sediment at the bottom of the bottle for this purpose . a good two fingers of head pillows up from a hard pour . soon after , the scent of hops permeates our nostrils . an old-school aroma of high-alpha hops shows that this is an ipa before the first sip : pungent , citric and floral all over the place . hint of lightly toasted grain in the nose as well . smooth mouthfeel and a moderate body give points to drinkablity . mild biscuity malt and some yeast upfront . this all gets wiped away from a wall of hops -- first the sting of bitterness and then a long , lingering herbal and citric finish . for hopheads looking for a fix that 's also a session beer , here it is -- a brew that we 'll be frequenting often . try pairing it with a hot pot of green curry ."

S"appearance : very light , transparent yellow color . one finger that vanished rapidly . extremely light lacing . smell : to the extent there is much of a smell , i 'm picking up some grains , corn , and light malt . not much in the hops department . taste : a little malt in there . the corn and grain flavors are apparent . not hoppy at all . it 's pretty watery as well . to be frank , it 's not very tasty at all . mouthfeel/drinkability : very light bodied and goes down very easy . i remember drinking a lot of these years ago . overall , this is probably my favorite light macro . since developing a taste for fine beer , i rarely drink it . but , i 'd take this over the other light macros available , especially on a hot summer day . in that setting , it 's not so bad . definitely not recommended though ."

S"let me preface my review : i had just driven 500 miles from albany ny to petrolia on to pick up a pinball machine , then drove another 100 or so miles back to brantford on ( where being the birthplace of wayne gretzky is a booming cottage industry ) in the space of 13 hours . in 90 degree heat . and no a/c . i tried keith 's ipa in a ice cold 1 liter mug at a local pub . and , under those conditions at that time , it was the perfect beer . i 've never had a beer cut through a thirst like that before or since . nothing fancy , lightly flavored and inoffensive , but it knows its job and does it spectacularly well ."

S"clear 12oz bottle ( no date ) poured into a shaker pint glass : appearance : clear dark coppery orange color with an off-white head . initial 1/2 '' foam died down to a thin skin across the top and a good ring . good strands and islands of lacing noted . smell : hmm ... .i wonder if this bottle had been out too long . smell is predominantly skunked hops with a very faint hint of malt in the background . no , not good . taste : skunked hops up front and at the end , with a malty middle . i can tell there is some sweetness and scotch ale trying to get out , but it 's overwhelmed by the skunk flavor . it 's not bad , but damn , it 's not a good scotch ale either . mouthfeel : mild carbonation but still spicy on the tongue . beer really clings to the teeth . thickness under the carbonation is slick and smooth though , but the skunked hop flavor smell i think is throwing off the mouthfeel also . overall / drinkability : this is now 2 for 2 in the past 3 months that i have been unable to get a good bottle of this beer that i had many years ago and loved . either this stuff does not keep fresh or the clear glass is ruining it . i suspect it 's the clear glass is ruining the beer in the store while it sits on the shelf . if i can find a bottle i know is really really fresh i 'll buy it again and review again , but otherwise i think i 'm going to skip this one ."

S"12 oz bottle poured into my large gulden draak tulip , karma is a pale orange brown with a very large , off-white head , fluffy and long lasting , very rocky as it slooowly settled , leaving big hunks of foam . authentic , rustic farmhouse for sure , down to the suspended particles . smell is all fruity esters , tangerine and lime , some spiciness as well . taste is estery as well , but it really brings out the malt , caramel and bread , a bit of a hoppy bite that flirts with metal but i think is just the yeast for which this beer is a showcase . really pretty nice , i can see how it would n't be for everyone , the fruity tang is pleasantly familar , and one of the reasons i really enjoy this style of farmhouse , a darker saison on the beire de garde . mouthfeel is on the thinner side , attenuated by the dry finish . drinkability is pretty high , although i only had the one bottle , this would be a great choice for bbqs , thirst quenching , enough flavor to stand up to grilled food , and what it 's belgian brethren lack , value packaged . if i had n't been drinking my homebrewed saison all summer , i would have probably leaned on this . i really dig such full flavor and reasonable abv ."

S"looks like an imperial stout . coal colored with a nice finger tan colored head . head recedes to a film and the film last until the pint is empty . lacing covers the glass . the smell is much more bitter than i thought it would be . smells kind of like sour milk , but it does n't smell bad . nice mixture of sweetness and bitterness in the flavor . has kind of a milk chocolate and sweet toffee flavor , and the bitterness just kind of lingers in the background . this is very interesting as i 've never tasted anything like this before . in a blind tasting i would expect this to be an imperial stout of some kind . it 's in the mouthfeel you realize it 's not an imperial stout . the mouthfeel is thin and watery , but it works with this beer . this is a wonderfully complex and different tasting beer . with me it 's like froach 's heather ale . not for everyone , and not to have often , but good to try and experience and revisit after awhile ."

S"a : it 's one of those macros with enough color and just enough head retention to not raise your defenses . s : light lager my left nut . this is a macro lager and i am thoroughly not impressed . t : first , take bud and subtract the carbonation . then , remove 20 % of the water . so it 's basically a different take on bud . m : the mouthfeel is worse than bud . the lack of carbonation leaves the shittiness bare for all to taste . it 's all newspaper-y . d : unnecessary . pointless and bad ( and stupid to boot ) ."

S"following my hefe i inquired about the 'black ' beer at max . and the bar tender told me it was like a stout but a lager instead . i clarified , so its a schwarzbier like samuel adams black lager or kstritzer and he said yeah like sa . well my first impression was that it lacked a lot of the roastyness of shwartz , but had a pleasant fruity sweet grain and german malt attribute . it did n't take long to realize the was in fact a munich dunkel lager . the brewer confirmed and indicated the abv is close to 6.5 % appearance : served a dark brown mahogany color bordering close to black with deep red hues buried in there . the thick head measured only one finger do to the fill and as the frothy head faded and the level of the beer drops the walls are lined with heavy lace . smell : a small lager aroma , largely clean with some chocolate malt aroma a touch of fruit and a bit of sweet dry grain . it is toasted but not roasty enough if it were to be a shwartz . taste : again , light chocolate and toasted grain flavor . a hint of vanilla and malted milk balls and only a hint of roasty bitterness . a clean lager-like body that seems a bit watery with some splashes of sweet fruits and dark berries finishes clean and crisp . mouthfeel : too light . not terrible but not up to par either . drinkability : if you can forgive the light watery body this becomes a very drinkable beer . the brewer estimated the abv at 6.5 based on the gravity but based on experience drinking it , i 'm guessing it is not that high . this beer is again no frills , but tasty enough and worthy of a pint or two . hope this is helpful . cheers !"

S"750ml bottle , allegedly lagered for 18 months before bottling . no sign of a bottling date . the body is brilliantly clear , golden-copper in color . i 'm hard-pressed to think of a more beautiful beer ; the color is truly outstanding . the head is fleeting , however , leaving behind no lacing . this smells very , very malty , though fairly mellow ; there 's prominent fruitiness reminiscent of peaches/nectarines and golden raisins , caramelized malt , lager yeast - not much to it overall , it 's essentially a malt showcase . very clean . incredibly sweet on the palate , and in a fairly one-dimensional way . honey-like , lightly caramelized malts are dominant , and there is n't much more to it beyond a touch of sulfurous lager yeast . the body is syrupy , and there simply is n't enough flavor to justify the high abv . with age and oxidation this may become more complex , but right now it 's too simple and sweet to be particularly impressive ."

S"unplugged berliner weiss new glarus brewing company appearance : this beer looks like apple juice . it is a pale yellow color that is transparent . a small head with little retention and minimal lacing fizzes at the surface . smell : sour yeast odors mix with sweet apple and grape aromas . the smell is most certainly unique and awfully pleasant , unlike any beer i have ever encountered . taste : up front , an explosion of tart , sour apples hits the tongue . the next flavor is almost identical to white wine . the finish is very clean , crisp , and wet . the aftertaste is sour and delightfully tart . such a unique flavor , i am clueless to find something to compare it to . for me , this one has definitely set the bar for this style . i read somewhere that sour is the new bitter . if it 's true , new glarus is ahead of the curve with this creation . mouthfeel : this beer has a very light body and the carbonation brought its three friends snap , crackle , and pop to bounce around in your mouth . drinkability : the light body makes this beer easy to finish . however , the tartness and the sourness make it more of a challenge to open a second bottle ."

S'got this from a trade with beerzack . thanks man ! tasty brew . poured a 16 oz can into a snifter . appearance - this brew pours a transparent deep brown color , but ends up a deep translucent brown in the glass . the brown is tinged with hints of garnet . it produced a 1 finger light brown rocky head that left behind light/minimal lacing . it has okay head retention . overall , a pretty good looking brown ale . smell - i really like the smell on this one . it is very deep and complex for a brown ale . the scent smacks you with a large dose of chocolate , caramel , coffee and molasses . i can detect a hint of vanilla , and very distant herbal hops . wow . i could sit and smell this one all day . taste - the taste is pretty good , but doesnt quite live up to the smell . not nearly as robust . it contains all of the flavors that are present in scent - chocolate , caramel , coffee , vanilla and molasses though it contains thoses flavors , it runs more thin . it has a nice , light hoppy finish . mouthfeel - the mouthfeel is pretty nice . it has a crisp initial sensation as it runs over the tongue , but then blends to smooth creaminess as it washes down the throat . moderate carbonation level . medium bodied . drinkability - wow , this is very tasty . perhaps my favorite brown ale - and that is saying a lot . brown ales are not typically a style that i frequently reach for , but this is a damn good beer . huge nose , decent flavor , low abv , smooth creaminess makes for a great tasting , easy drinking beer .'

S'when poured into my glass all i can say is wow , the head is perfect . it pours two and one half fingers in height and is a creamy egg white in color . as it recedes to a stable one finger size it leaves a fairly good amount of lacing along the sides of the glass , though i have seen better lacing characteristics . color is orange dark yellow and the beer is not very clear , cloudy-overcast . there is a deep sweet malty caramel aroma to this beer . the nose also picks up citrus hop tones . aroma is nicely balanced between malt and hops . fruity esters and clove and banana phenols are present in small amounts . the beer is fairly well balanced in flavor as well as aroma . its got enough bitterness and hop flavor to off set the caramel , phenolic , and ester flavors of this brew ; but it could use more hop bitterness and flavor . there is also a bit of a grainy/huskiness flavor in this beer . i also notice a wheat characteristic to this beer , reminds me a bit of oberon and it just doesnt seem to fit here . definitely wasnt expecting any yeast phenol and ester characteristics , however it does make for an interesting interpretation of the style . in the mouth this beer is creamy , that much became evident when i burped and some of the beer came up with the burp-very creamy . carbonation is subtle and is not really noticed unless specifically focusing on that aspect of the beer . it does not interfere with this beers flavor profile and actually accents the malt characteristics of this beers flavor . does not have a dry finish , and goes down quite easily . i probably wont buy this beer again ( in the near future ) just because there are so many other interpretations of this style . i am also not a big fan of banana and clove phenols in an american style .'

S'poured from a bottle into a clean pint glass . the ale appears dark brown and semi-transparent with about a half inch of off white head initially that within a few seconds dissolves into barely anything . it has a faint but inviting smell of ginger and a smell that is a mix of brown sugar , orange peel and perhaps a touch of roasted malt . a real pleasure to the sniffer . it has a moderate roasted/nutty/ginger taste that leaves a faint aftertaste . similar to the smell but well balanced . it has an initially light taste that leads to foam if held in the mouth . after a few sips my stomach felt a bit bloated from it . it is a very good beer but i do not think i could drink this ale on a regular basis . i do believe that it would be perfect for sitting near a fire as the roasted flavor would enrich the experience . this is an ale that i would pair with food . i would probably pair it with a pudding desert or perhaps a toasted sandwich with mustard .'

S"12 ounce bottle , bottled on 2/22/10 , enjoyed 2.5 weeks later i 've had this beer before but never found it particularly noteworthy or interesting , but early buzz on the 2010 release indicated that it was much improved from the previous batch . sure enough , this is delicious . the color is a very deep amber verging on red . spotty lacing down the glass . smell is really nice . citric hops and apricots with the apricots being perhaps a little more forward . for the taste though , the hops dominate with apricots swirling around amidst the strong hop character . previously i found little hoppiness with dominant apricot character . here i find the freshness probably adding to make this a true contender of an ipa with just enough apricots to make it more complex and darn tasty . mouthfeel also strikes me as improved from previous batches i 've tried . previously i found it too thin , but this tastes just right for an ipa as far as thickness/slickness . this beer is insanely drinkable . i rarely spend a night drinking the same thing throughout , but this one just might make the cut . 12 ounces is n't going to be enough . the 4-pack in my fridge should probably fear for its life ."

S'served from bottle into a duvel tulip . poured a very pale yellow orange with a minimal white head . maintains nice lacing throughout . the aroma is comprised of wood and mothballs ( holy crap ) . the flavor is pretty much the same as the aroma . it had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation . overall , holy shit ! this thing is horrible . i was warned by another ba not to drink this in a lnba thread , i should have listened . drank around 4 ounces and the rest went down the drain . this thing is just plain nasty ...'

S"this is one of my fall back beers . i can not believe i have not reviewed this yet ; i guess it got lost . having this beer on tap , it 's almost like a light guiness . i do love the nitro , even though it does not add anything to the actual taste of the beer , it does make it creamy , and it does look terrific . it is so smooth with some buttery/ nut flavor that invites you to drink more of it . this is a great beer to drink at all times , all year round . it is also a good beer to give to someone who is just beginning their venture into the world of real beer ."

S"pours out as a dark golden chill haze yellow with a very thin head of off-white bubbles that disappear as fast as they arrive leaving a thin ring and minimal lace . smell is more like a bavarian lager then an ipa , i get mostly toasted grains and malts , smallish sweet citrus with a touch of grassy/floral hops , not to mention that its faintly represented and kinda flat . this does n't come across as an ipa or any other pale for that matter . taste is quickly over and raw , seems to have an undercooked grainy malts that lend some toasty factions but mostly reminds more of grilled corn husks then anything . hops are inadequate and hardly approachable in abundance , whats there seems earthy light and herbal and lingering late in the finish is some vitamin-like coating and flavor . very dull , very drab , and almost undrinkable , had to brace myself towards every sip . no sir i did n't like it and did n't finish it either . i have one word for this , `` why ''"

S"live review . poured from the 22 oz . bomber that i bought at heinen 's in gates mills a few days ago into my cooperstown beverage trail pint glass ( and not the snifter recommended on the label ) . `` bottled on '' date of 03/06/10 so you know this stuff is fresh ! i forgot the price , sorry about that . a absolute motor oil pouring into the glass with an actual dark brown head that slowly builds up from below and hangs around for several minutes . this is one bad ass looking beer . 5.0 s darkest of dark roast malt with a strong hop presence . the bitterness of the hops provides a nice balance against the dark-as-night roasted malt foreground . hard for me to say for sure but i think i pick up some dark fruits as well . 4.5 t/m wow , this is one hell of a beer ! huge , sticky , syrupy bigness with a surprisingly sweet malt and the hops well buried by all of the syrupy bigness but peeking its head out now and again for a look . just a huge , huge beer that is hard to get my mind around let alone described the taste . i really enjoy the aftertaste , a nice sweet malt , lingering sweetness with some hops in the distant aftertaste . i do n't know how the feel could be improved as it matches its sinister look and image from the label . 4.5/5.0 d well not that great due to all of that bigness , the abv . drinking this beer is an adventure , one that is a joy to undertake . i could not drink any more than this bomber , however . 3.5 notes : consider me very impressed with this one from goose island . thanks to the guys at heinen 's for securing this one ( they had about 50 bottles left when i was there on tuesday , 3 23 10 ) ."

S"this was coming off the truck when i walked into my local distributer . i was in the mood to try something new , and i did n't want to spend much , so i decided to give stoney 's a shot . pale gold in color . tastes and smell of corn , minimal hops . i 'd like to say that this tastes significantly better than pbr or stroh 's but it 's pretty much the same . i will say that unlike some other entry level beers this one does not suffer from repeated exposure , you can drink it all day without growing to hate it . drink this one very cold , any less than totally chilled and the corn flavor can be overbearing ."

S"i just picked up a bottle of this today , logged in here and saw this review , so i figure i 'll give it a shot as well . i 'm an american college student living in london for a while , and this has been my first opportunity to legally purchase beer . since i do n't have to confine myself to the cheapest , easiest to chug then smash on your forehead beers anymore , i 've been trying to try a wide variety of different kinds of brews . the idea of exclusive groups of belgian monks making 'trappist ' beers in their abbeys intrigued me , and i 'm trying to sample as many as possible while i 'm in europe . so far i 've had chimay blue , westmalle tripel , and now this rochefort 10 . anyway , i do n't know anything about reviewing beer , but this is a very good one . it comes off pretty strong , and it 's obviously very alcoholic , but it 's not harsh at all . it 's a rich brown , with a lot of nice tan head initially , and it leaves a nice lacing on my glass , which i admit is not the recommended trappist chalice . still , it tastes great , and i can definitely see the coffee and chocolate , and the flavors linger on my tongue for a long time . i dig it . all in all , well worth the three pounds or so i paid for it , and the long walk across town to get it . especially when i consider that i 'll probably end up paying more than that for a bottle of budweiser in a bar later tonight . cheers"

S"bottle # 276/384 . thanks seth for bringing this back for me . this beer pours super thick ; a viscous ooze from within a dark bottle . black as a moonless night , the perfect cover for this spirit to creep forth . omens of its haunting already show - a calm , flat surface , nearly no head , and no lace leaves an uneasy feeling in the pit of one 's stomach . the dark apparition comes forth from the mist of my chilled bottle . wafting past my nose are the scents of mild chocolate and water-logged wood . underlying it all is the sweet alcohol smell of a time-worn bourbon . the bourbon may be as old as the apparition itself , but that does n't detract from all of its natural powers . sharp alcohol marries with smooth vanilla notes . sweet elixir , i believed one glass was adequate to enable one to gather the necessary strength to face the spirit . i was wrong . very sweet caramel , toffee , and dark ripe plums and dates greet my tastebuds . but as quickly as the sensation arrived , it is literally beaten into submission by the hot hot burn of the demon 's breath ; this is one strong-tasting brew ! the dark apparition has my number now ... the back of my throat quite warm , more sweetness arrives in heady waves . brown sugar and mocha intermingle with tons of mellow bourbon . vanilla and oak interplay well . as the demon warms to the climate of this realm of reality the beast takes on new strength . the warmer it gets , the hotter this beer becomes . bourbon becomes more and more the front-runner of the flavor profile . by the end of my second glass i was struggling with the dark apparition . if you love a bourbon heavy ba stout then this is the battle you 've been waiting for . i , however , had to toss in the towel in defeat . the dark apparition is a medium bodied entity which is very lightly carbonated . very dry and oaky , super sweet with vanilla and the like , and boozy . overall the bomber 's a real sipper . super heavy on the bourbon , and thus not my favorite , but a real treat nonetheless . i 'll see you again someday dark apparition . i suspect that with a few years age the patient will have a much easier time defeating such a strong foe ..."

S"i 've been pretty excited lately to see craft microwbrews in cans at my local whole foods . the oskar blues lineup is absolutely phenomenal and i hope to see many more breweries follow their lead . this beer from butternuts instantly caught my attention with its cartoony presentation . look : i 'd prefer to just drink this guy from its fun-looking can but for purposes of this review i 'll give it a pour : it comes out as clear copper with a dissipating , small white head with clingy suds . [ note : an extra point for the pigs on the can . ] smell : sweet and inviting . i 'm getting butterscotch [ is that just because the brand is called butternut ? ] and honey . nothing overpowering about it . taste : bready malts and cinammon from beginning to end . kinda simple but not bad at all . i 'd need more hops to consider it balanced . feel : light-medium bodied . goes down effortlessly . drink : easy and fun to drink - destined for sessions ."

S"750 ml bottle , bottle may 2006 a : pours a rusty brown under a medium sized white head . excellent lace and retention . s : a lot of sweet fruit , some sweet grapes , malty , toffee , hint of oak , even a little bit of belgian tropical fruit character . very nice smell . t : oak really comes out here and it is damn near perfect . very oaked up front , with a bit of sweetness , finishing in a slight bitterness , bit of toffee , booze and alcohol warmth . excellent taste . m/d : full bodied , carbonation is a bit too prickly , alcohol is there but done nicely . it 's a sipper and one bottle is probably enough , but this is still a fine beer . very good example of what oak and oak alone can bring to a beer ."

S"bottle from bevmo in santa monica , ca . cracked this at a party with several beer drinking friends . it quickly erased all memories of beer ingested prior to it because of an intense nose , super boozy flavor and a warming sensation in the gut the more it was consumed . seriously , this is beer to get you drunk and it makes no bones about it . looks like alcohol , smells like alcohol and definitely tastes like alcohol . however , sometimes that 's what you want . a strong american barleywine style knockout punch to end a night . just make sure there is a comfortable bed nearby if you do more than 1 of these ."

S"this to me is an excellent example of an average session beer . there is nothing here to excite the more experienced beer drinker . smell and taste are present but not overpowering . this is undoubtably a mainstream uk macro but it stands head and shoulders over us macros . i also think this is a good gateway beer . it 's recognized and familiar , and the taste should n't offend anyone . i like to have this around at parties to encourage macro drinkers to move up and if i have left overs it does n't need to go down the drain . bottom line , it 's a pleasant but unremarkable beer . i like to have it when i do n't want a complicated beer ."

S"i 'm not entirely sure that this qualifies as `` beer , '' per se . the most distinctive characteristic is definitely `` seltzer , '' to the point where my girlfriend commented that , upon hearing its dismal abv , you could simply `` cut '' coors light with seltzer to produce something akin to beck 's premier . that being said , however , i 've grown oddly fond of the concotion . it inspired me to make a dive to my local distributor to find a bottle of anchor 's small beer , which , alas , they did not have . the taste , of course , is nil , though it 's oddly refreshing as a water drink , rather than a beer . what caught my interest , however , is the uniquely low alcohol content . not quite an na beer , but almost half the alcohol content of most lights , this is something of its own class . smirinoff `` pure '' comes to mind ? anyhow , it 's appearance , nose , mouthfeel , and taste are so lacking its not really worth dignifying with a description . i am going to give it a `` 3 '' for drinkability , though , because i honestly believe that this is a great utility beer . it 's remarkable for , say , family functions where the possibility of embarassing oneself in front of aunt gertrude is ever-looming as a direct result of a mountain of free beers and , lets be honest , not much else to do . the same goes for tailgating when you actually want to remember the game or concert , etc . it 's the ultimate in session ...

S"tasted in a pint glass from a 14.9 oz nitro-can . a : to me guinness draught is the standard to measure appearances against . why , you ask ? because the cascade effect is cool to look at , the opaque jet black standard stout color , the creamy , one-finger thick head , and a good deal of lacing throughout . s : faint scent of roasted malts , chocolate , and coffee . t : a combination of sweet roasted and chocolate malts with hints of coffee . the bitterness of hops is almost non-existent . the taste is all malts with a roasted malt and coffee aftertaste . m : the body is light for a stout but it does have a creamy feel to it . very light on the carbonation . smooth and easy to drink . d : this is the standard brew that most stouts are measured up against . the light body and low abv combined with a good taste and smooth , easy drinking ability makes it a good session brew if your choices are limited . in my opinion , it remains `` an oldie , but goodie '' - the classic introduction to the world of dark beer ."

S"out of a growler into a pint , purchased at the brewery on 5-28 a - pours a brown to almost copper color- on the darker side of the ipa style . head formation is strong , well retained , and eggshell in color . very well filtered , no hazing or hefty carbonation present . s - an assertive bouquet of floral hops - grapefruit , piney , and floral . certainly alpha acid dominated . just a hair of nutty malts hanging around in the background . t - one of the few ipas that i have found that can get hops on your palette before any sweetness or malt . bitter but balanced up front with a floral hop hit . mid-stream is rather flat , just continuing to build with more hops and nutty/roasted malts . the end is where the hops take over , giving it a very hard hitting aftertaste . m - thick and creamy - full of body . carbonation is moderate to low , so this beer has retained its full body from superior brewing ( recipe or process : not sure which ) . not much bite from carbonation as i said . d - very drinkable for an ipa - the flavors are well integrated , and the abv is manageable to a bit above average . i could see ( and have ) downing many of these at the brewery . this is where i may get a bit down on the beer relative to its ba ranking : its an awesome ipa , but is it deserving of its high stature on ba ? i unfortunately do n't think so . i am a huge fan of mth brewing and will order a mm when i can , but i am unable to break it away from the myriad of awesome other ipas such as racer 5 , stone ipa , or two hearted ."

S'appearance - tawny brown-red with a thick head of foam initially . disappointing reduction of head down the glass , fading to a thin ring after half drunk . aroma - floral hops and dried fruit with the alcohol readily apparent . taste - rich roasted malt and dominated by dried fruit reminiscent of dates , prunes etc . followed by alcohol and spicy hops that linger for a good while . mouthfeel - initially medium but quickly becomes heavy with a noticeable sweetness as the beer is drunk . a mild but persistent sour note is also present . drinkability - a powerful and complex beer , rich and satisfying . however , its strength and richness makes this beer not for all occasions . perhaps as an digestif or as a winter warmer to combat cold conditions . this inflexibility marks it down in my personal tastes .'

S'a. yep , it does look like motor oil . absolutely no head , even after trying with a straight down agitated pour . although i love a good head on any of my beers , the utter lack here is appealing - i.e . the motor oil look . s. mellow , oak , vanilla , licorice and an alcohol burn/kick . t. lots of flavor from the oak with vanilla and licorice and fig accents all melded perfectly - probably aided by its 3 year age in the bottle ( a 2008 vintage ) . after taste is espresso and vanilla oak flavors with a tiny bit of bitter chocolate in the way back of the palate . m. very silky and surprisingly light . medium bodied i guess i would say . d. so much more drinkable than a standard stout , even such a strong oak aged one as this . the alcohol is nowhere to be experienced ( except in the aroma and a slow creeping buzzz ) , its truly remarkable . cheers to port brewing and to those of you reading'

S"poured from a 22 oz bomber into my duvel tulip . a= an attractive beer in the glass , amber to reddish in color . s= it smells fine , but i now know this is a spiced beer . t= metallic spice taste right off the bat , in a belgian ipa no spice is needed . should be a nice hoppy beer with yeast spiciness , this just taste like spice to me . m= a little on the thin side with no obvious maltiness . d= i had a few sips and needed to dump this beer , maybe the worst beer i 've tried in a long time ."

S"i was first introduced to ipas with this beer , and my appreciates and done nothing but grown for it . it 's full of hops both smell and taste-wise . it 's only slightly bitter on the palette making it very drinkable . it poured a dark orange with a solid head . one of my favorite ipas , and for the price , definitely one i like keeping always stocked ."

S'a - dark dark ruby , such an amzing color . tranquility from looking down upon it . a beautiful lake , during the late night hours . not a very big head , but what it lacked on the head , was made up for in retention . this beer just retains , retains , and then retains some more . s - sweet ripe fruit , light chocolate , malt , and more malt . t - taste upfront is a huge malt rush . dark fruits , rich chocolate , cloves , and spice . alcohol presence is definitely there , and attributes the flavor incredibly well . mouthfeel is creamy , fullfilling , and makes the palate tingle . nice and full-bodied . this is one excellent sipper . aventinus overdid themselves with this beer . a mistake , that was well worth being mistaken for . a world class eisbock .'

S'tastes like carbonated , alcoholic coffee ; all with a smooth , malty finish . it pours a very heavy , pitch black color . a nice thick , creamy head formed on the beer , and lace coated the entire inside of the glass . the aroma is of chocolate covered coffee beans ( hmmm , a favorite ) . the flavor is heavy colombian coffee , thick and rich . the alcohol is present , but is hidden way behind the coffee . matls and chocolate also come through . i want to say hops are present , but they are hiding out of fear of the coffee . the mouthfeel is heavy . also , kind of like real coffee , i am not sure my stomach can handle more than a couple of bottle of this stuff , just way to rich and acidic from the coffee .'

S"a - poured from a tiny bottle that says `` 75 % fresh ale and 25 % ale aged in oak '' sounds good to me ! forms a nice one finger tan head over a uniquely hued brew that is red , brown , and purple depending on which angle you look at it from , and it 's almost black when not held to the light . a quick swirl brings the head back to a finger and leaves lots of nice tan lace on the glass . after about five minutes , the head and lace disappear and never return ... .even with vigorous swirling . s - this is one of the most unique aromas i 've ever smelled . i smell vinegar , grapes , turpentine , glue , sourdough bread , lemon butter , asparagus pee , fingernail polish remover ... wow . there is a lot going on here . there seems to be two predominate aromas ... vinous grape and sourdough bread , and a solvent-like chemical smell that actually smells pretty damn good . i smell fetta cheese and grape leaves too ... reminds me of greek food . t - ok , well ... it 's assertive and unique . this actually startled me at first , and i made a sour face when i took the first sip . so , now that i know what to expect i 'll sip again and re-evaluate . strongly sour and tart with some musty elements . i taste vinegar , fetta cheese , salt water , sweet tart candy ( minus the sweet , emphasis on the tart ) , and some sourdough bread in the finish ( emphasis on the sour ) . the aftertaste is a pleasant mix of balsamic vinegar , fetta cheese , and grape leaves ... .very much like some good greek food . this is a really unique flavor that i 'm not sure if i really like , but i do respect it for it 's complexity and uniqueness . m - pucker-tart and sour as hell , this wicks the moisture from your mouth and replaces it with battery acid tartness ! pretty much feels like drinking vinegar with some light carbonation . d - although i can respect where this is coming from , and i may actually buy it again for it 's outstanding complexity and uniqeness , i would not care to drink this on a regular basis . drinking more than one in a sitting is out of the question due to the tongue-scathing acidity ."

S"just a simple classic american pilsner . i actually had this beer at the belmar beer on the pier festival , which i believe was the debut for beach haus . as a beer on a whole this beer is really just average . as an american pilsner is quite above average . you ca n't compare this to all of the great eastern pennsylvania brewery pilsners ( victory prima pils , sly fox pikeland pils ) because those are really a different style . beach haus almost tastes like there are no hops whatsoever . this is just the perfect beer to drink on a warm day in your backyard or at the beach . and it better be considering the brewery is in a beach town on the jersey shore . i wish them much luck in the future and look forward to more ridiculously drinkable craft beers ."

S"a - cloudy brown with a massive three finger head with excellent retention and lacing . s - decent smell . caramel , sugar , corn , and some light hops . t - so this is n't the most complex beer , but it 's still very refreshing and tasty . hops are light but bitter , and they are most prominent in the finish . it actually has a bit of a bmc taste to it . normally , any trace of bmc taste in my brew is a disaster - but tonight , on a blistering hot evening , after a long day of work , while watching the sox get their asses kicked , the corn and wheat tastes of bmc in this beer are spot on . m - average for a light tasting beer . nothing special here . d - great ! this beer is light tasting with mild hops , mild aroma , and no trace of alcohol . on a hot summer night , i could put this one back all night long . i would n't spend days seeking this one out , but i would definitely buy it again if i saw it on a shelf . i guess it 's worth mentioning that part of the reason why i gave this brew such a favorable review is because a ) it surprised me because i have n't heard the best things about this beer and b ) it is much less syrupy , sweet , and boozy than it 's big brother , double crooked tree . whereas i feel that double crooked tree is more of a barley wine , crooked tree is a nice , light drinking , true ipa that i thoroughly enjoyed ."

S"22 oz bottle poured into a st. bernardus goblet . due to the size and shape of the glass the head was not very tall , but it has a lot of body . egg shell white in color , it leaves ropes of lacing around the glass . the body color is a lot darker than what i expected . slightly hazy but still allows plenty of light through . when held to the light it glows a honey amber color . i really like the way this looks . the mixture of hops and belgian yeasts gives off a sharp and dry bitterness . the bottle says they use four different malts and three different hops . i would like to know which ones to help pinpoint what i 'm smelling . to put into perspective it 's like a very hoppy triple . taste is just like the smell . it has a dry , slightly aspirin flavor from the yeast , but the hops give it more texture than that . the mouthfeel has a medium body with a soft texture from the carbonation . very tight bubbles the smooth . cathedral square is still brewed and bottled at weston . this is a very bold and challenging beer that was executed well"

S"well , what to say about this great bottle . the pour : pours a medium amber color with a fluffy cream colored head that lasts a few minutes , not to bad for 9 % abv . makes for an attractive presentation and really displays the aroma . the smell : hops . not that you were expecting different , but the sweet floral citrus aroma of this beer lets you know that its coming . the taste : with such a strong component of hops , one would expect a strong bitter taste , which is present , but this beer also delivers some interesting notes . slightly sweet with notes of honey the spicy flavor of cloves . interestingly , very smooth , though with a slight astringency from the alcohol , though only briefly as it finishes . the feel : smooth , not to heavy , and a bit dry on the finish . drinkability : definitely not your `` session '' beer , though it drinks smooth and is n't to much of a fight like some ipa 's that display only the bitterness . about one will set you well for a while ."

S"appearance : clear dark reddish brown body . one finger of off-white head . leaves above-average lacing . a handsome beer that really looks the part for a winter evening . aroma : roasty sour malt with lots of spice and some hints of booze . not much in the way of hops . taste : lots of sour roasted malt that 's chocolaty and nutty . the hops ramp up a little in the finish , but still but never really come all the way to the forefront . alcohol comes through every now and then , but the malt body conceals it well . everything is nice and balanced for the style , but unfortunately a little thin . the aftertaste , conversely , is rather full very malty . mouthfeel : a little creamy , but much more lighter-bodied than you 'd expect . moderate carbonation . drinkability : it goes back easily enough with it 's thinnish body and moderate alcohol . certainly one of the quicker winter warmers i have tried yet . verdict : as you 'd expect from a sam adams offering , this is a solid beer , but nothing that special . i 'd heard great things about this beer , but it just seems kind of average to me . certainly not worth buying the mixed winter twelve-pack just to get two bottles of this beer , but not necessarily the weak spot in the pack either ."

S'picked this up on haight st after the barleywine festival . pours out a sturdy dark brown onto the desert playa . seems to have ample carbonation and head . was worried about freshness , but a vibrant coffee , hops and chocolate aroma still bursted from this one . taste , man , total porter/cascadian dark ale hybrid i guess . very hoppy , a little more thin on the mouthfeel from the malt perspective , of some porters . being that i drank this about 4 months after purchase , i was worried about the hopping . man , it was still huge . price at $ 6 for a 22 was more than i wanted to pay , and the beer is probably challenging to those outside of its niche , but i would definitely have it again . not sure how it differs from their blacktop iba though . both good .'

S"750ml bottle into sam adams perfect pint glass . the cork blew the second i took the cage off . a-an average poured produced about 1 '' of beer and head spilling out of the glass . a very , very , very gentle pour produced a 50/50 glass of beer vs. head . pours cola colored and left a bit of lacing . i thought it would leave more lacing . s-smells very good . roasted malt , coffee and chocolate . t-once i get past the distraction of the carbonation , i really like the flavor . dark roasted malt , a bit of coffee and chocolate , some raisins . its a very pleasant taste , but the carbonation , i mean c'mon already ! m-the overcarbonation of this beer completely ruins the mouthfeel . the only mouthfeel i can get is prickly carbonation . it truly is carbonation overkill . i had to take small sips and even then , the beer would expand into a harsh , foamy mess in my mouth . much like the pour , a very small amount of beer in my mouth turned into a mess of 20 % beer , 80 % foam in my mouth . i had to be very careful drinking this beer , and thats no fun . d-extremely harsh carbonation ruins the drinkability . its hard to enjoy the beer when the excessive carbonation fills your belly like helium in a baloon and you are constantly burping . good nose and taste , but the carbonation just simply wrecked this beer . i think i may buy another bottle , open it and let it sit out for a day or so and give it another try ( seriously ! ) i really liked the nose and flavor of this beer , but the carbonation was just over the top and ruined it for me ."

S"i tried this a year or so back and was very disappointed . i was super shocked to see how highly it was regarded here ... so i decided to revisit this brew with the thought that maybe i had a bad one ... this was from a bottle poured into a chilled pint glass a - nice brown/reddish/amber color ... good head but not too frothy ... looks delicious . lacing really good on the glass while drinking . s - strong alcohol smell to the nose mixed with vinegary overtones . the same as the last time i tried this beer ... which is what turned me off in the first place . not a pleasant nose on this one . no other noticeable complexities.. just vinegar and alcohol . t - tastes like a alcohol heavy beer with a vinegary aftertaste . the flavor is not unpleasant upon sipping , initial flavor is good . the aftertaste was just so overwhelmingly bad and came so quickly it ruined it , and made it hard to describe what was `` good '' about the initial flavor . m - not too bad ... not too light or heavy . did not feel like i had to `` chew '' the beer , but it was not a lawn mowing beer either . o - i 'm just not happy with my experience with this beer . i am really shocked at how highly it is rated here . it is so hard to get past the alcohol/vinegar smell/taste with with one . i 've had plenty of beers with higher alcohol content that were not so strong with the alcohol on the tongue . is it possible that i got 2 bad bottles ? could be ... but i 'm not gon na get this again anytime soon ."

S"i poured this from a 1 pint 6 oz bomber . initially there was much activity in the pour , so i thought this was going to be overly loaded with carbonation . the head retention was typical of an ipa , but it left a quite lovely lace after several minutes . looking through my glass into natural light , i notice this ipa is a bit hazier than others that i 've tried . before i poured , i took a whiff into the bottle to get a preview of what it was going to smell like in my glass . i noticed this ipa smelled overwhelmingly piney due to the heavy hop presence . nothing else really stood out . in tasting this brew , the piney taste was most prevalent . it left a somewhat spicy aftertaste , though . this ipa is not very fruity to me at all . this feels like a pretty dry ipa to me . initially after i take a sip , i get cotton mouth . shortly thereafter , my mouth waters from my taste buds being kicked from the piney sensation . as far as drinkability goes , i 'm never too picky . heck i 've drank my own sock water before ( i was a student at the usaf 's sere school ) . this beer is okay , but i would n't go out of my way to purchase it again , unless it 's the only ipa i can find . if it 's on tap in a local club or restaurant , i 'd probably drink it again . thesarge"

S"pours a thick black with a light brown creamy head and lacing . dark chocolate dominates the nose with some coffee and dark fruit underneath . taste follows suit , like drinking a dark chocolate bar . sweet chocolatey malts through and through . somehow this manages not to be cloying despite clearly being on the malty/sweet end of the spectrum . some roastiness and underlying hop bitterness bring balance . no alcohol noted even at 11 % . carbonation struggles through just a bit . full-bodied , lingering semisweet chocolate finish . has that chocolate mouthfeel even as it makes it 's way down . surprisingly drinkable . have also had this via bombers and on-tap , and am liking this more and more . insert every positive descriptor for chocolate , chocolate , chocolate . alcohol is very well hidden . not overly viscous even at this abv which i also like . update : i just love this stuff more every time , kind of like the movie office space , it really grows on me . crazy good shit . every time i have it , i ca n't stop drinking it , even though the abv is dangerously high for me . drinkability lowered just a bit due to the fact that almost every time i drink this stuff , i end up peeing somewhere random in the middle of the night ."

S"this beer obviously has a lot of character , and stone has made a good , distinctive beer . as the label will tell you , they do n't care what you think of it . but i shall review nonetheless ... it had a nice appearance , good color , but not too much of a lasting head . at least for me . the taste was strong and hoppy . the malt would break through , then recede . that was a nice touch . very hoppy . it mellowed a bit as it got warmer ( or maybe it was due to just sitting ) . much too aggressive to rank it high in drinkability . definitely one for the hopheads ."

S"i thought i reviewed this awhile ago , guess not . its raining hard and breezy here in the northeast , good time for a kbs . pours like sludgy motor oil , tan head that fades before you even knew it was there to a thin tan ring . aroma is so heavy on the coffee , chocolate , and licorice , and a bunch of smoke . flavors follow , thick complex malty mouthful , chocolate , anise , licorice , smoke , and coffee . ca n't really beat the mouthfeel factor on these big stouts , thick rich and luscious and chewy . i mean yeah the alcohol is hidden pretty well , and it drinks well but how many of these are you really planning on drinking in a sitting . i forgot how unique this beer is ."

S"appearance is a golden hazy color , with champagne type bubbles head is small from the start and white in color . smell is almost like a sweet white wine with a strong alcoholic scent ( update another bottle was quite skunky ) . if i was blindfolded , i would think it was a wine . the smell is not like most belgian ales i have tried taste is smooth , but acidic . with some apples detected as well as grapes . very little alcohol detected for a beer this strong . mouthfeel is thin and fizzy yet leaves a syrup like coating after going down . drinkability would be better if this beer did n't give me the impression that i was about to get a stomach ache , much like white wines do for me . this is not my favorite style of beer and this probably is'nt the best example of it . glad we got a la fin du monde after this one ! ! ! !"

S"the beer looks good , i 'll give it that . a deep tawny brown with a nice fluffy head that quickly collapses . after that it is all downhill . what little malt makes its presence known is pleasant enough , but the overpowering carbonation makes this beer feel like a soda-pop . couple that with the lack of balancing hops and the wild , fruity yeast flavours , and the beer is most unpleasant . i 'm not sure what it is about the yeast that is sorely misplaced , perhaps it is the lemon zest mixing with the rich caramel , or the tang of soured and rotten kumquats . kumquat , that is actually a good description for this beer . sweet , yet sour with a good deal of citrus mixed in . overcarbonate and serve . i liked chimay red . i did not like this . i was barely able to finish a pint of it ."

S"picked up a keith 's sampler containing three of their brews , including this one which i had never had before . pouring it into a standard beer mug produces a one-finger head that wastes no time dissipating into a thin ring . the beer itself looks like cloudy apple juice , except with a constant stream of bubbles percolating to the top , indicating heavy carbonation . the bubbles become far less dense once the beer has had time to settle , though . looks appetizing enough . smell is a little disappointing - has some fruity overtones , but other than that it smells pretty much like any macro lager . the first sip reveals it to be a rather watery concoction , and surprisingly enough the carbonation is kind of subdued . the taste is dominated by ( unsurprisingly ) wheat , yeast , and some barely-noticeable citrusy notes . the label claims there is spice in here , but i could n't taste it . this beer is extremely smooth , and i can easily see myself pounding several of these back . i think i can safely say that this is by far my favourite entry from the keith 's brewery . that being said , it 's still pretty uninteresting for the style , and i have definitely had better witbiers . if i buy keith 's again , it 'll probably be this ."

S"a large but not so sticky head forms over a dark ruby body . the aroma is at first very pleasant and tart , but as the head subsides and the beer warms , a subtle yeast spice and caramel malt aroma comes out a bit . flavor is quite spicy , reminiscent of chimay yeast , and very boring . yeast spicyness is boring and annoying , the warmer i let this beer gets the spicier . reduce the spice , and a good score could lurk , but as it is , no , another boring yeast beer from belgium . moderately smooth beer . drinkability is hindered by spice , with the exception of rochefort 8 and westvleteren 12 , i 'm done with belgiums ."

S"had this at the burger bar in mandalay bay . i do n't really see hirch brews very often , but thus far i 've really enjoyed them . pours a deep brown with brood red highlights and a surprising amount of head for a bottled db . i think that flip-top does a good job of keeping the carbonation . smells really malty . that 's pretty much the story with the smell , which is n't a bad thing . the taste actually has a lot of depth . sweet dried fruits ( raisin , prune ) , dark bread , malt , caramel , rum , cocoa , and the tiniest hint of hops to keep it from being too sweet . this one is non-typical as it has some ale fruitiness to it that i 've picked up in darker uk offerings . think old peculiar . the carbonation and lacing stick around for the life of the beer and the strength of the beer is hidden behind a wall of flavor that goes down easily . i really dig this doppelbock as it 's not cookie cutter at all . clearly not modeled after other examples , this one is paving it 's own path and doing a great job of it ."

S"a : pours a hazy yellow amber , w/ a thin white head that dissipated quickly a : sweet caramel malts upfront along with brown sugar that dominates the aroma . i could n't pull any hop aroma out of this beer . f : just as in the aroma , the sweet caramel malts and brown sugar dominate the flavor profile . no hops detected in the body or finish . this beer starts and ends very sweet . m : medium high body with medium carbonation . no creamy / astringency character detected . o : this beer reminds me alot of brown shugga from lagunitas , which is considered an american strong ale . i would n't classify this beer as an imperial ipa . the malt character is great , but this beer is seriously lacking in hop flavor and aroma to be in the `` west coast ipa '' category . appearance was also a little hazy . would have liked a little more clarity / head retention . this beer still has some good mouthfeel and drinkability . i do love me some brown shugga ! !"

S"2008 listed on the bottle . this is an `` imperial black ale '' brewed with pomegranate juice and a belgian yeast strain . 12oz bottle . pours a dark black color with a light tan head . the aroma is dark roasted malts with a fruitiness ( from the pomegranate juice ) . the taste is dark and roasty , with a sour finish with a strong boozy finish . they sweet and sour nature of the taste combined with the strong boozy finish make this beer undrinkable for me resulting in a drain pour . i can count on one hand how many times i have poured out a beer before finishing it , and this is one of them . do n't know if i got a bad bottle or what , but i could not stomach the taste . overall , i was not really impressed by mack in black and would not purchase again ."

S"poured from the bottle into a pint glass , beer is a clear , very light golden color with a bubbly , white head . smell is sweet with malt and adjuncts . taste is also sweet , with a tiny bit of bittering hops . not much going on at all . the mouthfeel is light with lots of bubbly carbonation . this beer is drinkable like water , mostly because it has very little character and is very light in body . as always though , just because you can do something does n't necessarily mean you should ."

S'this brew pours a clear amber color with a small white head . the aroma is quite balanced , malty and hoppy . it is a bit faint though . the taste is a lot more assertive than teh aroma . it is balanced , but leans a little more toward the hoppy side . the mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation . overall , this is a very drinkable brew ; great for sessions .'

S"this beer was received from pitasoup , from yet another great trade with a great trader . 750ml bottle . this review will be scored and averaged between three army buddies : 1 . ( me ) big chomp daddy* 2 . lawn dart 3 . spicy spence appearance : 1 . 4 2 . 3.5 3 . 4 it 's slightly cloudy , tannish brown , with a pretty good head and decent enough lacing . ca n't complain for the style . smell : 1 . 4 2 . 4 3 . 4 to me it smells like a dipa . very hoppy with some pungent malt overtures . taste : 1 . 4.5 2 . 4.5 3 . 4 tastes like a dipa too . very hoppy , you can smell the hops when you pop the bottle and it carries over to the taste . quite delicious tho . mouthfeel : 1 . 4 2 . 3.5 3 . 3 we all thought it was a touch bitter on the aftertaste , but i liked the feel more than my army buddies . smooth and bitter with a lingering bitter aftertaste . drunkability : 1 . 3.5 2 . 3.5 3 . 3 we all agreed mostly that it is a fine treat to be split three ways ( for a 750 ml ) but that it 's not an everyday drinker . for my own opinion tho , being a barleywine fan , this is fine stuff . too bad it 's a one time only release . *theme song plays note : the overage in scores was averaged close as i could call it between appearance and drinkability to reflect the most accurate possible 3-way score ."

S'poured into a pint glass . as far as light beers go , this one is perfectly fine . pale in color , there is not much to the appearance or the aroma for that matter . the most obvious part of the aroma is corn , which is not a good thing . the taste is sweet with a decent hop bitterness . mouthfeel is watery - like any other light beer . all of that said , this beer goes down easy and could easily be drunk all night . recommended .'

S'red/amber colored , with nice clarity but minimal head . smell is light , toasty and a hint of caramel . very light floral hop scents are present . tastes are light also . toasted bread and the caramel are again there . barely enough hops to balance this one out . this is just a light version of an amber . mouthfeel is skinny , thin and watery . i would call this one a nice session beer and even a summer beer . a small beer in aroma , taste , and body , it would make a good all nighter .'

S"had this on-tap last night at spike 's . served into a pint glass . appearance : body is a deep , dark mahogany color with not a whole lot of visibility . head is thin and white ( or maybe off-white - room was poorly lit ) and drags light lace . smell : toasted malt is quickly eclipsed by large hazelnut aroma . piney hops add a pleasant sting in the finish . taste : loads and loads of sweet hazelnut , followed by pine , spice , and citrus . hops provide for a clean , mildly bitter , ending . definitely good , but hazelnut needs to be toned down in my opinion . mouthfeel : smooth , chewy , and clean-finishing . carbonation is right where it needs to be . really great , except the body is a tad syrupy and heavy . drinkability : too much sweetness for me to call this one drinkable . on top of that , body is beefier than i 'd like . this is a great beer to try , but i wanted to be done with it after half a pint ."

S"i 've been a faithful sam adams customer for many years , and was excited when i spotted a new style on the shelf . i quickly purchased a six of weiss bier , and hurried home to sample this new offering . bananas . if i could write a one word review of this beer that would be it . this , combined with a bit too much carbonation for my tastes , rendered this brew nearly undrinkable . i did n't let that stop me , however i found it difficult getting through the six-pack , and was glad when it was over . to be fair , wheats are n't one of my favorite styles , but this was still sub par for the style . too much bananas , too much carbonation and just plain bland . big disappointment from sam adams ."

S"poured 12 oz bottle into tulip glass . appearance - poured a medium pure white head that is very velvety at the top and soapy below the surface . the head still has n't dissipated from the rim of the glass and it 's been about five minutes since i poured it . the color of the beer is a light straw hue . smell - the smell is pretty sweet . i can pick up traces of nectarine , white wine grape , pear , and some very slight notes of spice . the beer also smells crisp and citrusy -- slightly -- from the hops . the malt smells clean and raw and is in the background . i can smell no alcohol whatsoever . taste - very light taste . the first thing that hits me is the raw malt flavor and the pear tastes . quickly behind that is a fairly weak flavor of citrusy and crisp hops . a slight presence of spice sets into the aftertaste and remains in your mouth for a while , along with the raw malt flavor . there is very little to no alcohol burn . it is also very crisp and clean tasting . mouthfeel - excellent level of carbonation on this particular brew . it is light- to medium-bodied and there is no unpleasantness to this brew at all , but this comes with a bit of a sacrifice to flavor . however , it is still a quite tasty little brew , more than you 'd expect by looking at it . drinkability - this stuff has such a nice carbonation and easy , smooth mouthfeel that it 's literally easier to drink than a budweiser . perfect drinkability - 5.0 . overall , this is a brew that is somewhat lighter in flavor for most of what unibroue produces , but it 's definitely up to par with the quality one comes to expect from such a brewer . definitely recommended , and a perfect summer refreshment beer . would be great after a physical chore or just to sip on your porch on a hot day . a fine brew ."

S"2009 bottle of goose island bourbon county brand stout . i never thought i 'd get a chance to try it because its 13 % abv make it illegal to sell in ohio . first thing i noticed was that this is one of the darkest , thickest stout i 've ever had ( next to doris the destroyer ) . stouts are n't actually black , they 're an extremely dark brownish red . for example , guinness ( because everybody knows guinness ) is a surprisingly bright ruby . seriously , hold it up to a light the next time you have one . but i actually held bourbon county against a light bulb and no light made it through . i expected it to be good , but i figured much of the hype surrounding it had to be because it 's a limited release and people tend to just go apeshit over limited stuff . but it lives up to the hype and then some . no bullshit , i did not think a beer could have such depth or complexity . bourbon , vanilla , toffee , semisweet gourmet chocolate , fresh roasted coffee beans , toasted nuts , and light oak pulled into a sum so much greater than any individual flavor . it 's incredible . easily the best beer i 've had to date . huge thank you to goosu for this extra !"

S"had from the brewpub and presented in a basic pint glass . the beer was a light golden color with no head at all when presented - ( a rather absent minded server whose inattention i will attribute to the lack of a head on the beer , about a half finger of `` head space '' was present leading me to think the beer was at the bar for a bit waiting for him to bring it to me ) . lots of carbonation bubbles fed up the sides of the glass but little lacing throughout the sample . a `` light '' fresh floral scent . almost like wiffs from outside the door of a flower shop as it opens an closes . a clean semi-sweet malt aroma , some hints of peach and a trace of hops in the nose . the tatse is surprisingly hoppy upfront . much moreso than the nose would ellude . a lingering light fruitty presence , some peach and nectarine type flavors all backed with a semi-firm and just mildly sweet malt bill . crisp in the finish , just a tad dry . medium/light body , crisp , clean and hoppy . in interesting beer . the nose and the palate were presented with two different experiences here yet the end result was an overly drinkable -- if not overly exciting -- beer . hops grabs the tounge and are enough to keep the beer `` exciting '' while still being balanced and quite sessionable . a good beer , yet still probably not my first choice were i to see it again ."

S"pours out with some head , a fairly strong yellow hue , and plenty of carbonation . like most macros is lacking on the aroma , though the flavour is mildly better than the ( below ) average standards with some grain and excessive carbonation . mouthfeel and drinkability get their normal fairly low marks from me for a macro , mouth is very light with a lot of carbonation ( something i generally do n't care for ) while the drinkability is middle of the road , good , but not remarkable . like others i recommend only having this ice cold , and only in a pinch . i can tolerate it once in a great while , but it 's still a very plain jane brew ."

S"sampled march 2009 a regular pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces two-fingers of lightly tanned froth . the beer is quite a bit darker than i would expect from a golden ale and has a reddish , full amber color to it . when held up to the light the beer shows a lightly hazed , pale amber hue with lots of carbonation that seems to meander up through a beer that is viscous . the aroma has a certain sweetness to it that accentuates notes of ripe pear , some tart plum as well as some caramelized grain notes . there is also a lightly toasted , biscuit like maltiness to this beer as well as a bit of sweet-tea crystal malt character . there is a light spiciness here that reminds me of wild flower , black pepper and perhaps a touch of ginger . sweet tasting and full bodied , this beer gets sweeter as the beer rolls across the tongue and it is quite heavy bodied for a beer of this style . this has a creamy , viscous texture to it that seems a bit out of place . having said that , this beer is certainly not cloyingly sweet or stickily heavy bodied , i was just expecting something a bit lighter and drier ( not to mention actually golden colored ) . this is quite malty up front with notes of sweet grain , toasted whole grain cracker notes , and a certain , seemingly caramel malt influenced , sweet-tea like flavor . the finish has a bit of spiciness to it that tries to balance the up front malt and sweetness with some flavors of white pepper , something a bit like spicy oak , some lemon-ginger as well as an earthy spiciness that reminds me a bit of coriander . this is a fascinating attempt at a belgian style golden ale , really makes you wonder what the person who put together the recipe was thinking ; this is way too dark , a bit too sweet , and a bit too heavy bodied to be a great example of the style . not a bad beer , in fact i would likely have enjoyed it a bit more if the label had n't stated that this was a `` belgian style golden ale , '' as it is though , i definitely wishing i had a good example of the style in my glass instead of what i had ."

S"$ 5.49 for a 12.7 oz green bottle . bottled on 04-14-09 . pours out to a hazy dark amber , forming a modest light tan head with good retention and solid sheets of lace . the carbonation level is moderate . aroma opens with nuts , vinegar , funky barnyard , chlorinated pool locker room , and musty basement . the mouthfeel is soft , surprisingly not overly carbonated , with a medium light body . the taste is a recap of the aroma , but the taste is quite light , matching the light body , and there is not much sweetness to offset the tartness . i wish it were a touch sweeter . the finish is n't as dry as i expected , but it 's still pretty dry . this is a good , but not great , flanders red . not as tasty as rodenbach red or duchesse , but still decent ."

S"coming in a green six-pack box , painted with hop plants . the label of the bottle shows a man riding an indian elephant holding a canadian flag . i like this beer even before i try it . appearance is coppery gold , some blond hues near the edges ; extreme clarity , causing it to sparkle . a creamy , somewhat bright head , which collapsed to a minimal but acceptable layer , leaving large-bubbled , poor lacing that is not extremely intriguing to watch . i smell peppery hops immediately from the glass , metallic , fresh grass , tickling the nose . fortunately for me , the malt is there too , somewhere in the middle , because the aroma begins and ends with hop when i sniff the glass . caramel malt , some toasted bread , and sourish dough from the malt . the hops add an abundance of smells , some hard to define : salty black licorice , bitter herbs , dark green lettuce , and basically a lot of greens , grasses or vegetables . exactly what i expected on the tongue , starting with more cooked vegetable , grassy resin . eggplant in the middle , and the finish is less about the flavour and more about the feel : dry , mouth-puckering , leaving only a trace amount of bready malt . pepper , iron , soapy floweriness . with the 5.8 % i actually feel the alcohol in the finish too , seemingly accentuating the dry hops , making me want to get a glass of water for the dry feeling . medium to full-bodied , the hops doing away with any wateriness that might be lurking . since i am no strong-hop-lover , it is hard for me to be objective , but i do know a good , hoppy ipa when i drink one , and this is one . mt begbie 's pale ale , also out of bc , is more my style however -- more balance with the malt . hopheads will love this one though . not overly drinkable , due to the dryness and oily bitterness , and my sweet-beer palate allows me to only have one of these at a time ."

S'a- pours a clear copper , foamy yellowish beige head is full of bubbles and air pockets . settles down to a thin ring pretty fast , but leaves some great looking wispy lace behind . unfortunately the lace slides away and disappears . s- sweet caramel , and fruity tartness , tomato sauce like acidity , toasty and grainy , brown sugar , somewhat floral hops , marshmallow , and a touch of soft milk chocolate and cocoa butter . t- rich dessert flavor , mocha cappuccino , huge toasty grain flavors with burnt caramel and toffee , deeply toasted nuts and sunflower seeds , ripe red fruits , berry , melon , brandy , grapes , burnt marshmallow . grain quantity and flavor easily masks the alcohol content . nice hop flavor towards the end , earthy and herbal with hints of fruit blossom . into the finish , things get woodsy and soil , very toasty and earthy , some sulphur like radish greens . lingering crisp noble hop flavor in very nice . mf- juicy and a little oily , gets syrupy as it warms . nice almost full body . low carbonation , leaves a somewhat waxy feeling on the cheeks . d- a satisfying brew , malty and quite hoppy , like a german ipa if you will . big grain flavors and hop bitterness is awesome but something just gets out of whack with the mf for me . however it is nice to have a traditional maibock . wish i could find one from the super bestest brewery ayinger .'

S"being from the twin cities , everybody knows this beer . it 's ubiquitously on tap and that 's a very good thing . usually , it 's this or lawnmower beer . so , you start ot love it just for that reason alone , but then you drink it in the context of your home ( could be a bottle effect ) and it does n't measure up as the oustanding beer you felt it was back at the bar . so , that said , this is an ipa that tastes like grapefruit . if there ever was a grapefruit flavored brew , this is the one to compare it with . it 's still a non-fruit beer , but the overpowering flavor of grapefruit is all i can grasp in it any longer . yes , it 's refreshing and thus highly drinkable . if it 's available , you need to try it ."

S"i had this out of a 12 oz . bottle . the bottled on date was 04/05/04 . twist off bottle cap . the redhook website notes that this beer is made with `` a touch of organic rye '' ... .organic is good ... .so thats a plus . minimal head on this beer . the overall appearance was cloudy due to this being an unfiltered ale . i saw some wheat particles floating all over the place . the initial smell was not all that appealing , but i eve there is a definite crispness to this beer and there is a hint of rye in each sip . its a `` light and refreshing '' beer as advertised on the label , no question . overall , it should be noted that this is a nice and drinkable beer . this beer would work well on a hot , august day . the sunrye ale is not as enjoyable as the redhook rye from several years ago . one can only hope that redhook brings back the redhook rye and double black stout from the vaults ."

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a 12oz mug . off-white head was produced , about an inch or so high . it hung on for a few minutes . the beer is a decent brown/red hue . no haziness , this beer is obviously highly filtered . hops on the nose , along with another scent i ca n't quite place , but remember from other budweiser products . obviously the malts are present and accounted for , but nothing really notable . reminds me a bit of snpa . quite palatable but thin . well carbonated , which does n't hurt . the hop bitterness and the thin-ish malts combine to make an interesting flavor ... with a bit of a 'funk ' remaining on the palate after the initial flavors have faded . this is very unlike snpa , and unlike any other craft ale i 've had . this beer is very drinkable . i could have a few , but i fear that the funky aftertaste might build up and put me off . it seems like they put in only enough ingredients to produce the desired alcohol and some of the desired flavors . regardless , i would like to try this on draft and if it makes good market penetration , it would be an excellent alternative to the usual bmc lager-esque products ."

S"appearance : this is a clear reddish beer poured into a pint glass from a bottle labeled `` the world 's most fantastic beer '' with `` malt liquor '' slapped under it for legal reasons . this is the 2006 vintage . the head is off white , built to one and a half fingers but dissipated in about 30 seconds . the visquous liquid seems to stick to the sides of the glass when swirled . smell : when swirled reveals a deep , sweet maple syrup smell that dies down to show off a powerful malt smell leading into one of the most alcoholic smells i 've sensed outside of liquor . ridiculous , but surprisingly not really a bad thing . taste : super sweet , sticky , and syrupy on the tongue at first glance that gets sweeter as it goes down , leaving a somewhat burning sensation in the mouth ... kind of like the feeling you get when you just spit out mouthwash . aftertaste is highly alcholic and scotchy . in fact , this has the same aftertaste as a mid-grade scotch . drinkability : let 's be real here , people . this bad boy is 14 % . the taste is reaaaally alcoholic . i bought a 4-pack of this not knowing what to expect . i can only drink one of these every few days , and i 'm pretty much done for the night after one of these . this is a novelty type thing that i could see drinking once a year in the winter ... which is exactly what it 's brewed for ."

S"bottle poured into a chimay chalice . looked very light for a porter during the pour , not all that dark in the glass , very minimal lacing smell was rich with roasted malt , vanilla , roasted coffee taste was good . very roasty and coffee-infused , but overall slightly un balanced and quite shy of perfection mouthfeel was pretty thin , so much so that it really distracts and detracts from the beer . drinkability is okay . it is a rich beer that that could use so more balance in malt . i still enjoyed the beer but probably wo n't pay $ 9.00 a six pack for this ever again"

S"i drank a decent amount of this stuff in the heat of this past summer , but never got around to writing a review . i had a few decent ones in the summer survival pack , and later bought a six pack for my sister . though it 's a somewhat novel attempt , and logical idea to make a micro beer for the light and fruity crowd , it 's not one that i can really enjoy . pours extremely light , with a lot of bubbles and a little bit of head . the beer smells like it tastes , a little bitter with a hint of , you guessed it ; blackberry . upon consumption , it was hard to ignore the carbination when attempting to find any sort of individual characteristic in the flavor . it seemed more like a soda to me than a beer , and had roughly nothing in terms of alcohol . i think i enjoy this beer the most when i 'm sampling the spectrum included in the long trail variety pack , because i know that it 'll be followed by a nice altbier or ipa . other than that , it 's virtually useless to me unless i 'm sweating in the middle of a hot afternoon ."

S"this is an 8 % abv stout that is very flavorful . it 's a little thin , but i am a big fan . at the boulder event at pony bar on 1/18/2011 , i put the nitro version of the oak aged oatmeal stout against the regular obovoid . on nitro , this beer has almost no carbonation and drinks very easily , but ultimately , the non-oaked , regular version reigned supreme ."

S"the beer pours a cloudy golden wheat color , topped with a big , frothy white head . i had some yeast sediment in the bottom of my bottle , so i do n't know about this being unfiltered . not as cloudy as some weiss beers i 've had , but still attractive . great head retention , keeping a thick foam . aroma is excellent , with plenty of clove and some banana . clove is very pronounced , with a pleasing spiciness . soft wheat malt , with a bit of yeasty aroma . a bit of phenolic thinner-like feel you get with real german weissbiers . a bit mild and subdued , not quite up to speed with the imported versions , but definitely a fine rendition from an american brewery . flavor is very light and refreshing . a soft , gentle wheat malt caresses your tongue with a sparkly effervescence , giving way to a rich , almost cloying , estery phenolic fruitiness . moderate banana , with a hint of bubblegum . spicy clove follows , finishing the beer with a resurfacing wheat presence and some powdery yeast . a lingering maltiness , leaving a powdery , dusty yeasty feel in your mouth . nice and dry in the finish . extremely satisfying on a hot summer day . easily one of the best domestic wheat ales this summer . not quite up to the standard of schneider or ayinger hefeweisens , but very good . i thoroughly enjoyed the single i bought , and promptly went back for a six pack ."

S'picked up a sixer at the nslc . this is made by keltic in truro , only comes in cans as far as i know . appearance : pours a brilliant , deep , clear red with a tight foamy white head . good retention , leaving plenty of lace . aroma : bready malt , sweet caramel and diacetyl . some citrus in there as well . taste : very sweet and buttery . bready and dry in the finish , pretty low bitterness . leans on the malt side for sure . mouthfeel : a little thin , drinkability high . final statement : the better of the two from this brewery . its a great choice for quaffing from cans if you want a break from that macro stuff . i would take this fishing with me because of its portability in 355 ml cans and its not abrasive , overall pleasing flavour . it may lack a lot of the great things other craft reds have , but this brewery chose its market and it probably serves it well .'

S"well , my friend founds a bottle of this a week or two ago on the shelf so he picked it up . it may be a bit past its prime or not agedwell , or theres the chance that i do n't know barleywine very well ( which is very true ) poured from the bottle into a tulip glass appearance : it was very golden in color , every pour had lots of multicolored floaties in it , probably kicked up from bad handling , it ended up with about 1/2 '' of head and was very viscous in appearance . smell : very sweet and fruity , apricot , some nuts , smelled a lot like malt extract taste , very similar to smell , with wheat malt flavors , again apricots , maybe a hint of apple . reminded me of some light liquid malt extract i tried , nowhere near as intense , but not as attenuated as most beers ( keep in mind , i 'm not a barleywine drinker ) lots of viscous body , probably a sg of something like 1.030 . the alcohol is covered very well , did n't notice it at all , could be from this bottles old age . mouthfeel : quite syrupy , very smooth , some carbonation , but not overpowering , i was expecting it to be a darker flatter beer along the lines of a strong ale or an imperial stout ( i told you , i 'm not a barleywine drinker ) but still not unpleasent . drinkability : well , i certainly could not drink a lot of this in a sitting , i was surprised my friend and i finished a bottle between us . this is not something i would see myself drinking throughout the night , too sweet for me , but strangely , i didnt feel the need to sip it as a strong ale or a whisky . i would personally share a bottle of this with 3-5 friends as half a bottle is a bit much ."

S"this beer pours a pleasantly surprising black that when held to the light reveals a little bit of port around the edges of my champaign flute . the head is a light tan that leaves a nice lacing . there 's a big fruity hit of bret that 's all cranberry and cherry . there may be a touch of vanilla here , but it 's hard to detect . coming from the presuppositions of the smells , the flavor rings true with a heap of sour bret fruitiness . just when i thought i had the taste tied exclusively to the smell , the flavor transitions into a charcoal brown caramel and cocoa . this transition is legendary and remarkably balanced between the coal and sour . sadly , this leaves the mouth tragically dry and a bit numb . feels light and crisp with only the slightest bit of viscosity to reminding me of the sweeter elements present . a novel and well recieved experiment for sure . a delight to sip and explore , but after a few glasses , it 's novelty wears off ."

S"this used to be my fall-back summer session beer . refreshing and light-bodied , but still flavorfull for its style -- a great hot weather `` lawnmower '' beer . this beer pours extremely pale and clear with high carbonation that forms a soft white head that will linger depending on the age of your beer . some may not like the carbonation level , but given the overall beer style , this high carbonation seems appropriate , for the same reason higher carbonation is appropriate for bavarian wheat beers . the aroma is mild and not very distinguished . i detect some of the clove and afalfa honey aftereffects and very few spicy hop notes ... rather bland . the taste is a very smooth mellow sweetness from the malt and honey , with a slight snap in the finish from what appear to be domestic hops . the brewer states it uses a blend of four hops and 3 types of domestic two row barley , but none are dominant enough to identify . nothing challenging here in the taste . the mouthfeel is light and effervescent from the carbonation , again i think this is what the brewers were aiming for -- a light readily drinkable ale . this honey ale will not challenge a sophisticated beer drinker , but it is a tasty summer weather beer , that is highly drinkable and a good cross-over beer for anyone that is normally afraid to drink any beer without `` lite '' or `` light '' on the label ."

S'cheesy lable on the bottle is kinda weird , but fun and summery ( very apporopiate for the style ) . pours light golden to pale orange , with a rocky and thick pure white head . foamy lace drapes the side of the glass nicely . this smells , to me a bit like a macro pilsner . very harsh and brittle , with very weak and dull hops , and some slightly foul sour lemon notes . there are some really nice scents of saltine cracker , hard crusty wheat bread , grapes ? and salad croutons here too . the taste is much better than the nose . i keep thinking of hard salty crackers when i sip this one . this tastes very brittle and crackly at first then some malty characteristics settle in . hard crackers warm to more of a fresh from the oven warmth . a bit of lemon picks up towards the end , along with some green apple and grape . there is a faint chlorine or pool-water taste that is extremely subtle , comes out during retro-olfaction and is only evident as the beer warms . that sounds bad , but i think adds something pleasant to the summertime nature of this beer . this , more than other ( more traditional ) hefes , really is very very thirst quenching . this would be great out by the pool ! i dig the zesty lemon zing and the brittle saltine character , but the nose is harsh and sour and the complexity is a little lacking . a good thirst quencher and highly quaffable . i could session myself stupid with this one ... bottom line .'

S'poured from a bottle with a nice head but it leaves pretty quickly . color is of a normal pale ale , a light golden beer with nice small carbonated bubbles rising quickly . the nose is of hops and citrus . the taste is of the hops but it is very mild and good . this is a beer that i could drink pretty much all day . very light and tasty but not heavy at all .'

S'had on tap at monks kettle in sf ca . got a pint in a moonlight brewing pint glass , the beer was a very nice hazy golden color with a great very white strong head that slowly bubbled down . the smell was of hay and malts , pretty decent .the taste was of a farm house style beer that had been brewed with cigarette ash and dirt.i was very surprised because i payed 7.00 dollars for a pint of this . the mouth feel was very dry tho there was a haunting after taste of the beer . the drinkability was great , the beer went down super smooth , some thing you could easily pound.if it werent for the weird off taste i would have loved this beer , it looks great and you can pound it no problem but the taste was just too much of an issue for me to look past .'

S"pours out to a clear golden , forming a rocky white head with average retention and no lacing . carbonation is moderate . the aroma smells like sugar , grass , hay , and butterscotch . the taste is of adjuncts like corn and sugar . there is an odd underlying chemical sweetness with a peculiar metallic taste late in the aftertaste . chemical bitterness with the taste of pennies . the finish is lightly dry and grassy . bitterness is mild to moderate , and again , very odd . drinkability is poor . i 'm hard pressed to finish this bottle . i agree with jason . this is a beer that has no reason to be exported here . we already have it and it 's called `` olde-english 800 '' . yuck ."

S"this is from the brewers of the delicious delirium line ... $ 8.99 at home liquors , hackensack , nj ( 1 pint ) best by date/date info listed as : l : 1 2 3 4 ( 4 is checked ) 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 ( 2 is checked ) i hope this means it was bottled feb 2004 , the web link to the importer on the bottle is not valid , the web link to delirium.be doesnt help much either ... they do say on their site ( after using babblefish to translate ) that this one can be aged for a good three years.. so , i probably wo n't get botulism ( sweet ! ) appearance : semi cloudy brown with slight amber hues , good look to the carbonation , some bubbles seem to hover in the brew , ok lacing , good near white head that dissapates rather quickly nose : sweet liquor , ginger ale , peaches , malt.. later on down the pint i get more of a spiced fruit/apple scent mouthfeel/taste/drinkability : tastes like ginger ale bread laced with honey . the carbonation might turn some off as it feels damn near like a good schweeps to me . very clean finish on the take . no overall taste of the alcohol at a decently high abv ( certainly not an abv beast mind you ) .. you really taste what you smell , no deception or surprises here , it really mellows into a nice spiced apple cidery type of thing later on down . i would n't label this a session beer , one pint is enough to keep the interest , more than that might be a bit much for most people . verdict : for the price i might just go with the st bernardus abt 12 if i 'need '' a belgian . but for kicks and maybe a fall night this is a very nice , well crafted brew , interesting flavors and nose blend as one . it almost defies exact categorization , if you give it a quick pour you really get a nice crackling of sounds . this might be a nice alternative to a port as a digestif after a good meal , but not offset with any big cheese like gorgonzola etc.. a mild swiss or cheddar would be very very nice with this ."

S"poured from a growler into a pint glass . dark clear brown with an amber hue . slightly vigorous pour produced approximately 2 fingers worth of white , relatively dense foam head which reduced to a pretty solid ring of bubbles before long . lacing was light . rich malty hints on the nose with an earthy nuttiness that is so common in this style . it 's just sort of comfortable and inviting somehow . sweeter malty flavors roll over the tongue and make the first impressions , but as you are enjoying it , some of darker roasted malts come through . the finish is lighter than you might expect , not quite watery , with the only noteworthy indication of bittering coming just before the end . mouthfeel is a little flat , as in light carbonation . i 'm not sure if this was due to pressure loss in the growler or if it was inherent to the brew . overall , it was n't bad , but it was less than the average brown . i found the this beer went down way too smoothly ! session beer indeed ! ! not a terribly strong brew , very enjoyable over a few pints , and just a solid brew overall , the drinkability aspect was unexpectedly good . i wish this brewery were a little closer to home - i would love to sample some of their other brews ! !"

S"this beer was canned on 4/19/2010 . appearance : admittedly , this is a beautiful beer ; light shade of amber , almost a perfect mix of a yellow and orange hue , with a marvelous lingering lacing upon the beer mug in which it was poured . smell : my first smell my nostrils are bombarded by citrus zest , and pine followed heavily by what can only be described as body odor ? yes , the closest thing i can describe it to is the smell you are assaulted by when working out next to a sweaty , smelly guy . i do n't know what would cause that , but my god , i can not get passed it . taste : hoppy bitterness , followed by a smooth maltiness , and a slight sweetness that hits the side of the tongue , finished by a dose of wonderful bitterness . this beer tastes great , but the damned lingering smell and aftertaste of bo just is too much for me . i really want to like this beer . mouthfeel : slightly thicker , but that is too be expected of such a high gravity beer . not too terribly carbonated , but not flat ; just perfect for this style of beer . this beer feels wonderful in my mouth and on my tongue . drinkability : if it were not for this odd body odor smell , tastes , and aftertaste i would adore this beer . seriously , it looks good , feels good , tastes good , but is ruined by what has got to be a bad batch . i bought this beer in a 4 pack from the whip-in in austin , texas , and i can only assume that this has got to be a bad batch that is throwing off this body odor hop flavor . i ca n't say i am willing to try another to test my theory , which is a shame as i have absolutely loved all the other beers from oskar blues that i have tried ."

S"poured from the bottle into a pint glass . appearance : pours a very pale straw color and comes with a short 1/2 finger head that fades immediately to a very thin and incomplete skim ; body is slightly cloudy and shows light carbonation ; oily and loose strands of lacing cling to the sides ; i guess i 'm used to seeing a huge 2+ finger head and pretty cloudy body from my belgians ... smell : smells more like a white wine than a beer - light and slightly soured fruits ( grape-like ) ; slightly yeast and a very mild scent of spices in the back ( corriander ) . taste : much like the smell , the light and slightly sour grape-like fruit aspect is shared with a yeasty/straw like aspect ; slightly musty aftertaste . mouthfeel : carbonation is stronger than it appears and is actually pretty potent and lively ; body is crisp and light and still manages to leave a pretty firm coating of stickiness on the roof of the mouth and back of the tongue ; belly is left a little warm from the abv . drinkability : it 's not bad - it 's an alright tasting beer , but for something labeled as a belgian strong pale , i do n't feel it competes with some others out there . i also likely would n't attempt too many since it does clock in at 8 % ."

S"750ml bottle . pours a nice deep chocolate brown that settles in black in the glass . the head is tan , thick and enormous , refusing to go anywhere and leaves sheets of lacing . the aroma is massively roasted with almost a burnt malt character . plenty of cocoa powder and only the faintest hint of chipotle pepper , though it does grow as it warms . the taste is much like the aroma except for the finish . the start is all about the black malts , heavily roasted , with chocolate and hints of espresso . but the finish is where it gets interesting with the pepper flavors coming out and leaving a serious burn on the palate after each sip . the mouthfeel is smooth and close to full bodied for a normal porter . this thing almost has the feel of a baltic porter , which is impressive given the abv . there is certainly no doubt that mikkel knows his way around stouts and porters and this is one of the more interesting ones i 've had . it 's a big , robust porter with a big dose of peppers in the taste . certainly not the most drinkable porter , but very complex and tasty for a porter ."

S'during a cold snow storm this beer hit the spot with its boldness and complex flavors that converged to bring out coffee in this stout . i would not drink this beer when the temp is above 50 degrees , but in cold weather it seems to warm you inside . the color was jet black with a nice copper head that held for 5 min it smelled of chocolate and coffee and those flavors were present during the drink . it reminded me of brooklyn black chocolate stout but much , much more drinkable . i could drink 1-2 of these in the course of the night but anymore then that may overwhelm the pallet . i would recommend this beer to friends and think it is worth a try to all who enjoy any type of coffee flavor in their brew .'

S"a : nice amber tone with a good head . holds the head quite well at first , though starts to fall after about 2 minutes . s : hop aroma is more subdued than i would like and not at all floral ; do they dry hop this beer ? i do n't actually know , does n't say anywhere on the bottle , but the rather lackluster nose would lead me to believe otherwise . t : hop bitterness is prevalent , but the herbal character of the hops comes through as well . i wish it was a bit more floral , though i do appreciate the hop herbal flavor beyond simply pure bitterness . still , the bitterness predominates over other hop flavors . it 's not the most complex ipa in the world ... well , not even close . m : it has a nice fullness in the mouthfeel , but it finishes a bit heavier than i would like for an ipa . it does n't have tha kind of wet , lingering finish you sometimes get from english style ipas , but is kind of halfway between that and a proper hopped up , dry hopped american ipa . seems to fall short of both styles in my book . d : the heavy-ish finish combined with hop-centric bitterness takes away from its sessionability , and i can session nice ipas with the best of 'em . verdict : not bad . really , not bad at all . but that 's about it . it is n't a bad ipa , but it 's nothing to write home about either . if it 's there , and you want a decent ipa , and there 's nothing on the order of two hearted to be found , go for it . do n't need to drive to 'sconnie for this one ."

S"purchased from evanston first liquors for $ 6.49 a bomber . looked new , so i was excited to try it . served mildly chilled . was close to room temperature by the end . poured into a small snifter . orange-gold with several active carbonation streams . the head is a soft milky white . i was expecting it to really explode like many other saisons , but this was more subdued . stayed at a steady cap on top . streaky lacing sticks around the edges . great color . adding the yeast turns it into an opaque peach color . one ca n't help but expect to find cherries immediately in the aroma , but they are far less present than i expected . they come across as more tart than sweet . after that , typical farmhouse aromas appear . a little grassiness , some pepper , a touch of vanilla . i feel like this should have a much stronger nose than it does , even though it was suitably complex . i ca n't say i 'm disappointed in the taste , even though there was nowhere near the cherry flavor i was expecting . it 's wonderfully complex . cherries linger , but never dominate the farmhouse aspects . crisp wheat , doughy yeastiness , vanilla , sweet and tart cherry and apple , white pepper , clove , lemon zest , some funk . a mild but sharp hop bitterness . finishes sour and dry with lemon and mild cherry . adding the yeast actually seemed to bring out more fruit flavor . i did n't really notice alcohol on the palate unless i looked for it . this was very good , but i feel like with a little tweaking they 'd have a big hit . similar to some of southern tier 's other offerings , this features super-fine carbonation leading to a soft , delicate mouthfeel that suits this beer perfectly . it maintains a medium light body in the mouth without fizzing up , allowing the palate to be explored fully . well done . even after flattening out a bit towards the end , it stays juicy and smooth . this is a lot less extreme than the other offerings in the imperial line from st . it 's not quite like the other saisons i 've had , but it 's no cherry oaky monster . it 's not really any more extreme than a hennepin even . i sipped on this one for quite a while . i 'm not sure that having a full stomach slowed me down a lot , or if it was just a lot of work to down a bomber . while i would hog a bomber of most of their brews for myself , i would n't mind sharing this one ."

S'for starters , drinkability is low because it is a seasonal plus a little $ $ for a beer that you can get from other brewerys around the usa . very good coffee stout ... .just wish it had more coffee flavor . drink this one room temp to a little cooler . too cold and you lose all of the wonder and greatness behind stouts . please ! ! ! ! dark brown to almost black . thin but very thick ... hard to explain . appears thin in the glass but when in the mouth , takes on a smooth thickness which is nice . good stout that could use more coffee notes . bells java stout has this one beat for sure on the coffee flavor . anyway ... . wish redhook would make this year round , in 6-packs or 12-pack , and for less money . expensive when considering java stout from bells which is also better . otherwise , a very very good stout . strong on stout ... .low on coffee . the only downside to this beer .'

S"poured from a 22oz bottle , printed with this description : `` this hop monster uses premium american 2-row and a touch of light crystal malt to create a solid malt foundation . '' blah blah blah , then `` we use hop extract , hop pellets , and hop flowers , hence the name hop juice . '' the hops type is not noted . the beer is hazy pale golden color with a really thick cake of foam , and a solid wall of lace all around the glass . i 'm glad to see that only pale malts were used , i prefer it when the hops can take the stage in this type of beer . the aroma is more floral than citrus , with a hint of honey ( not sure if honey is added , but it does smell like it ) . the beer tastes not quite as good as it smells , it seems too bitter to quite match the floral notes . a little backwards , this seems bitter upfront and tastier in the aftertaste . thin-to-medium body which belies the 9.4 % abv , dangerous as you could easily pound this before realizing the buzz you 're in for ."

S"pours a slightly cloudy light amber with a thick frothy white head ( good retention and lacing ) . aroma is crisp hops , lots of pungent citrus with plenty of grassiness but not a lot of sweetness . taste is definitely skewed strongly to the hops side . bitter and strong , all the flavors are there : orangey citrus , pine resin , grapefruit rind and freshly mowed grass . alcohol elements are present but not oppressive . if it were n't for a very light , toasty malt base and the flavor of alcohol , it might pass for hop tea . mouthfeel is light and thin with a nice acrid sting on the lips and gums . clean taste , not heavy on the malts like a lot of other double ipas . ( i 'm not even sure i would classify this as `` imperial , '' just a really strong ipa , perhaps a new style altogether . ) for a devout maltman like myself , this could convert ."

S'augsburger oktoberfest is a new offering from the stevens point brewery . i dont remember augsburger having an o-fest before , but i might be mistaken . the label says it is handcrafted honoring the traditional german oktoberfest . it is not even listed yet on their website . 12 oz green longneck with a nice bavarian inspired label design . no apparent freshness dating . beer pours a medium copper with an off-white head . the head disappears fairly quickly and leaves a skimming across the top that hangs our for the duration of the beer . sheets of lacing . the beer has a fresh aroma . some subtle hop/pine nose with grain and slightly toasted malts . not quite enough of a nose in my opinion , but what there is , is decent . beer is slightly sweet from the malts . this one may have more hopping than some others in this style . the beer has hints of hard candy and caramel and very lightly toasted grain ( think whole grain bagel ) . the mouthfeel could be beefed up a bit and the carbonation lowered a notch . in spite of this beers minor flaws , it very drinkable . i like a little more oomph to my oktoberfests , but this seems to a nice rendition of the more modern offerings . glad to see point continues to expand and experiment .'

S"bottle to tulip . a : like all of omegang 's brews , this one pours with a huge head . four fingers of light brown , soft creaminess lasts incredibly long . dark ruby-brown opaque interior with transparent crimson edges . the head comes clean off of the glass , leaving only light smatterings of lace that stick from the body . s & t : light malts of toasted grain and rendered sugar . light earthy yeastiness . the hop component is hard to pick out , might be herbal . lots of sweet , overly ripe fruits . cherries , dates , golden raisins . moderately sweet . light flavors/aromas of tobacco , anise and cola . long lasting flavor . the back end of the palate presents a lingering fruit bitterness , which is hard to describe accurately , but something that i do n't find very enjoyable . moderate presence of alcohol . m : medium to medium full body with any alcoholic texture . average fizzy carbonation . d : since i do n't enjoy the finish of this beer , i do n't find it to be very drinkable ."

S"well , this lager was yet another member of the large group of very insignificant beers . the taste was extremely light and watery though not `` bad '' as it was quite hard to find any other flavours but water . the smell was average , exactly what you would expect for an average beer . the best trait of bavaria holland was its drinkability . on a hot summer day after work the beer would probably be a decent choice . too bad i drank it on february ."

S'poured into a nonic . saffron in color with a fluffy white head of 2 fingers . the suds reduces to a cap , leaving some splotchy lacing . pretty typical west coast apa hop profile in the aroma . grapefruit citrus and pine with a touch of grain . could stand to be more pungent here . the hops are at the forefront here , reminding me even of some lesser ipas . pale grainy malt is at the front of the palate , while the cascade and chinook hops dominate the finish , lending a citrusy bitterness . mouthfeel is pretty much perfect . really easy to quaff , medium-light body with carbonation to match . drinkability is huge .'

S"serving 11.2oz bottle an awesome pour produes a huge and surprisingly dense head that nearly runs over its boundries , plenty of healthy dense lacing adorns the glass just above a respectable milky white cap of froth . a noteworthy dose of fine bubbles meander their way through an amber body tinged with copper and a touch of haze . gentle hop aromas meld with generous spicy malt , grainy bread and mild floral scents on this brew 's wonderful perfumy bouquet . as the beer warms and breathes , it reveals new scents of sweet and sour fruits , tart red berries , dried currants along with hints of nuts , juniper wood and whiffs of alcohol . robust bready malts , bitter floral hops and a bit of fruit lead the charge and break rank to reveal undertones of malt , sweet and sour fruit and a bit of nutty , earthy spices on the mid palate all of which eventually tie neatly together with a full creamy off-dry finish featuring flavorful tart red berries , hints of wood , citrus zest and jasmine . a cascade effect at every turn reveals interesting new flavors , with bready malts , bitter floral hops and a bit of spice lingering from start to finish . the sour fruit requires balance , it is a bit too mouthpuckering and the dry , tart finish needs a touch of sweetness . a well developed creamy body allows this beer to handily coat the palate , it 's a great performance for mouthfeel while a slightly dry finish and lingering sour notes keep drinkability in check . overall , this is a well-crafted , complex brew with a myriad of sublties and intriguing nuances . cheers !"

S"2005 is really proving to be quite a year for the craft beer industry . my second 20th anniversary brew this year , along with a dozen or so 10th anniversary beers . handsome russet brown , a thin , microscopically bubbled collar holds down the fort on the top end . a little creamy dollop in the middle of the brown liquid , for good measure . no lacing , although head retention is decent . very chocolatey aroma , similar to the sam adams chocolate bock , or newport storm 's '05 . a soft raspberry tang right up front . lagery roastiness , more along the lines of a schwarzbier than a porter , with that signature lagery smoothness . all the edges have been rounded off . very fruity , beyond raspberry and into cherry and plum . unique . what works in the nose does n't follow suit in the mouth . pervasive raspberry flavors , with a soft tanginess clash against the lagery smoothness of the malt . light bodied . weak feeling on the tongue , fairly dry , with timid carbonation . very fruity , especially when coupled with the beer 's estery qualities , abrading against the refined feeling the malt provides . brittle , bittersweet cocoa creates a feeling of strained tension towards the end , blending nicely enough with the malt flavors , but clashing against the sweet , candylike fruitiness up front . no apparent hop flavor . maybe some bitterness . certainly not a trace of alcohol . lingering raspberry tartness and bittersweet cocoa powder . as it warms , the fruit gets rather artificial tasting , and frankly kind of foul . the last inch is a real chore to swallow . usually chocolate and raspberry are a winning combination , but not in this case . maybe the malt is too sweet itself , a bit too caramel , maybe just too gentle to support the brasher fruit flavors . whatever it is , it does n't work at all with the raspberry . presentation is fine , and it 's too bad the flavor does n't follow suit . quite similar to the chocolate bock and newport storm i mentioned earlier , and i did n't like those , either . perhaps lagery beers should remain unadulterated . was there an underlying reason for the reinheitsgebot ? i 'm normally at least tolerant of fruit beers . tartness is also usually a plus with me , but not with this flavor combination . i really had a hard time finishing the one bottle i bought ."

S'pours a dark brown with a tanned head of big bubbly foam . smells of barley and malt sweetness . also has some coffee notes and a bit of yeast . quite a bit of spotty lacing on the glass . light feel with low carb . taste is a bit watered down for a stout but has traces of burnt grain and a little bit of coffee/chocolate character . it reminds me more like a black and tan than anything . for something as epic as a 250 year anniversary , i think they blew it on this release .'

S"poured a clear copper with a very nice initial head -- cream colored , dense bubbles , about 2 cm high -- fades to a thin ring around the beer , leaving some droopy bubbles on the glass , which fairly rapidly descend back into the beer itself . smells nice -- apparently those are spruce tips ( though i 'd have believed that they were some mild piney nw hops ... ) , solid malt backbone ( toast with honey & caramel , fresh baked bread ) , faint cinnamon . tastes good too , more of that spruce than anything else , but the christmas spices come out , and there 's a good chewy malt feeling to this brew . that said , for whatever reason , i have a hard time having more than one of these . it 's pretty light for the style , so that 's not the problem . for whatever reason , this does n't appeal to me in the same way that many warmers do . maybe it could use some more complexity in either the hops or malts ? anyway , it 's my first abc beer , and i 'm excited to try some more of their products soon , as this is an interesting take on the style ."

S"bruery 's hottenroth is a weird brew for me to review . i have n't had too many berliner weiss 's , and i love the taste of it . but all the same , it looks like an adjunct lager after the head dissipates , and its tart , dry and funky smell disappears fairly quickly too . a friendly review would call it delicate . a review that slammed it would compare it to miller lite . i 'll lean more towards delicate , but ask for a bit more . it starts off tart and puckery . in the middle there 's a bit of breadiness , but not much . and it finishes with the pepper and citrus esters that brewing with wheat often provides . it 's light and watery on the palate , and highly drinkable . no doubt a fun beer to pair with salads and lighter fare , the bruery 's hottenroth would also be great on a summer day in the park , or after your monthly jog . ( like tonight ) . and you wo n't hear me complaining about 3.1 % alcohol by volume . what a gift !"

S'i had this on tap at their brewery in ellicotville . i must say that the first taste kind of blew me away , like no other stout ive ever had before . from my expierience , beers that have fruit flavor in them are usually better as dark beers than as light , not always , but most of the time . anyway , this beer was motor oil black with an extremely creamy head that lasted to the very last drop and left a lot of decent lacing . the smell was that of malt , mostly chocolate , with a hint of a creamy kind of cherry smell . the mouthfeel of this beer really was the kicker for me . it was extremely creamy , but thick and malty at the same time , a great stout . the taste was very similar , lots and lots of creaminess . the last time i was at the ebc brewery this was no longer on there list , however they had a new anniversery oak aged beer there . i really hope they brew this one again , because this is my favorite of there whole selection as well as several other people i know .'

S"well , i was interested in trying this beer and thought it might be a quite nice experience with the ingredients listed- pale , vienna , and dark malts as well as over 30 % oat malts ; venezuelan cocoa beans , carob from sicily , and hallertauer hops . unfortunately.something went very wrong . i suspect that it is either the way in which the cocoa was processed ( or not ) or the addition of the carob . the overall characteristic of this beer was of overripe cheese . ( classic line from ding : `` someone put cheese in this beer '' ) . pours nice enough , dark , almost black with a decent brownish head . aromas of cheese and rotting fruit . tastes porter-like with the addition of overripe washed rind cheese , decaying fruit , and the tiniest touch of chocolate . mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy , but not as silky as so much oat would lead one to expect.. overall , its simply undrinkable . back to the drawing board with this one ."

S"thanks to my friend abby who busted out a bottle of this on a random sunday afternoon . a - 2009 vintage poured from the bottle into a chalice . poured black and thick like motor oil , brown around the edges . was split up amoung 4 people , so the pours were n't long enough to generate any type of head , not sure if there would have been otherwise anyway . s - not what i was expecting , a lot of fruit in there . i smell currants and cherries right off the bat with some roasted coffee , toffee , and little cocoa . quite a bit going on , and you can definately smell the stoutness to it all through that . t - taste of chocolate covered cherries hits me right away , followed by some underlying dark fruits . the initial sweetness was quite shocking , but faded into coffee and cocoa and finished up with a nice roasted malt taste . hint of vanilla , almost an afterthought in this rings through at the end . maybe i 'm just missing it , but i ca n't taste any alcohol . amazing , full , and complex flavor . m - no carbonation on this one , very full bodied and syrupy thick , but not unpleasant . really what it needs to be with the flavors it 's bringing out . d - this one is a sipper for me , and ca n't do a whole lot of it , which is probably a good thing at 13 % abv . amazing flavor though will keep me coming back for more whenever i can get ahold of it . definately hyped , but it delivered ."

S'pours a slightly murky dull copper color with a medium sized head . nice lacing on the surface . smell is sweet malt . bready . grassy hops . nice bready malty flavor . herbal hop flavor and slight lingering bitterness . really balanced and smooth . medium bodied . extremely drinkable . this one reminds me somewhat of yuengling ( which i like and is my standby beer of choice ) but better . definitely a nice new spring seasonal and one of my favorites from magic hat .'

S"my 5 for drinkability is explained below ... . this bottle was 1 year old , a lone hangout from a six pack i bought for a guest upon his visit . hiding in the fridge it had been cold and in the dark . wife forced me to do something with it so i ... . opened it ... . and drank some of it . i was a little scared , it being a year old but this thing must have been through every preservation technique known to man . poured into a kitchen glass ( no beer glass for this , not worthy ) , extremely light yellow with very small head , dissapated within 30 seconds . looks like urinal whiz . no smell . my wife and i tried a blind smell test ( sniffing , not knowing when the bottle is presented to the nose ) i got it on the second deep whiff , barely . no taste , no malts , no hops , just fizzy water . not offensive , you could drink this like water ( thus the 5 , ca n't get more drinkable than water ) but then why not just have water ? if you really need a beer that bad but do n't want any taste or other goodies that go with , you are probably an alcoholic . have that looked at ."

S'a shorty 330ml freshness dated bottle poures a huge , solid foam head . great care needs to be taken to slowly pour this beer so as to not over-develop the head . the head lasts forever , leaving lacy traces all over the glass with chunks of foam in the center of the beer . i chose to pour the yeast , giving a slightly turbid , pale golden color . the nose initially gives a sharp , bitter aroma that mellows to a citrusy , lemon and corianter scent . the taste is more muted than the aroma with pale malty sweetness noted in the mouth , followed by hoppy bitterness down the throat that lingers on-and-on . the mouthfeel is light to moderate . this is an eminently drinkable beer , especially to perk-up the taste buds before the evening meal . the 8.5 % alcohol is well hidden in this smooth , very drinkable ale .'

S'amber and clear with decent white head with very faint tan color . very hoppy smell with a malt undertone , pleasant start . flavor is a battle between fresh piney hops and slightly sweet sticky malt and sugar . super good drinkability with little sign of the heavy gravity . not a beer you can drink easily all night due to power and flavor potency . overall this is my favorite american iipa , an example that through dedication you can strike a fantastic balance between strong alcohol , high hoppiness , and sweet maltiness . there must have been many batches thrown away to get this gem .'

S'dogfish head 120 minute ipa this beer billed as an ipa is but a shallow ipa . it seems to me as if dfh put all their effort into creating a beer with 20 % abv rather than the ipa art . the ipa parts seemed as if it was just a vehicle for transporting the 20 % abv . the beer poured with a dark amber color . a short frothy head appeared only to collapse back from whence it came a few minutes later . the nose was a scant hoppy , malty wisp . the flavor was surprisingly non alcohol centered . but still considering that the bottle label said ipa- its but a scant ipa . there bittering units of hops were there , commingled in a deadly embrace of a strong note of sweet malt . some notes of caramel and other sweet related permutations of malt were there , but considering the ipa paradigm , the flavors seemed out of place . the alcohol was not center stage , but none the less could not be ignored , especially 10 minutes after half the bottle went down my gullet . finally , i have to consider the 10 bucks a bottle . was lots of fun to try to satiate my curiosity , but will this brew become a regular in my cellar or my tasting cabinet ? not likely .'

S"seems like many others had the same disappointing experience with this supposed ipa that i did . i went and visited the brewery and was completely excited to get some brewery fresh beer until i tried this . very disappointing . pours a straw like color with basically no head on it . being an ipa , i expected a certain amount of fruity , floral aroma to it ... there was none . again , being an ipa i was expecting a huge hop presence ... there was none . medium carbonation . i really decided that this was poor when i ordered the sampler and could hardly tell the difference between the `` light '' and the ipa . i would liken this very much to just your average budweiser or bud light . i will say however that this beer is great if you just want something to sit back and drink without really paying much attention to its qualities . it is a good `` hot day '' beer and perfect i 'm sure for drinking games !"

S'this is probably one of the more unique beers that ive had in my time . where to start . a : easily one of the prettiest things ive laid my eyes on . pitch black with a 2 finger chocolate brownie head . s : not in your face roasty but you know whats to come . not sure i expected what i smell . distant chocolate roastiness with an even more faint sour fruitiness . t : definitely not what you would expect at all . but after reading the label and realizing what i had bought , it makes complete sense . roasty , chocolate , malty and a valentines day treat , chocolate covered fruits ! its like a consecutive rush one after another as it swirls around the palate . first roasted malts , then bitter chocolate , next is the tangy fruit accompanied by hops and finished with the famous alcohol warming sensation . by my count , this is far from balanced but a great approach none the less ! m : not crazy about the carbonation , could be a tad lower but it works . this thing kicks . d : eh.. couldnt have more than one unless it was some sort of extravagant special occassion . in which i would probably just buy dfhs palo santo marron over this anyday . o : awesome idea , but might want to work a little harder on making this one better the next time around .'

S"i had to pick this one up when i saw it . as the father of two kids , how could i pass it up ? i fully expect this beer to be gross , but at least i can keep the bottle . i drank it straight out of the bottle in honor of the malt liquor style so i have to say the appearance is excellent because i love the bottle and the little story on the back . the smell and taste can be wrapped into one section . it basically reminds me of putting bread in a blender with some water and blending it up ( will it blend ? ) . that is not to say it is terribly bad . having cut my teeth on steel reserve and similar brews as a kid , i was afraid this beer would take me back to that awful place . not so . the malts hit hard and the corn listed on the ingredients is nowhere to be found on my palate . mouthfeel is a but too rich and syrupy to handle . you probably wo n't find anyone drinking more than one of these . the alcohol content is unknown , but it feels pretty strong after downing about half of it . to summarize , i expected much worse and ended up finishing the whole 22oz bottle with a smile on my face . i ca n't say i could do that with most malt liquors ."

S"wow . some real work went into the creation of this brew . from a snifter . nitro-tap gave a dark presentation with a small caramel colored head of foam on top . strong aromas of roasted coffee beans , dark chocolate and malts . taste was complex and well rounded ; flavors of coffee , roasted malts , unsweetened chocolate , roasted grains and a touch of wood blended really well . mouthfeel was heavy and dense , but not at all sticky or syrupy . nice job there . drinkability is only average . it 's potent , and it 's good , but only one every now and then should be enough . recommended ."

S"12oz bottle into duvel tulip . `` born in 2008 . '' appearance- dark reddish-brown , nearly a full on red color . pours with a slight head , but not much , and not sustained . i poured fairly vigorously , and the duvel tulips are known to hold a head , so i think it is the beer . smell- very rich malt smell . also a fairly clear cherry smell . taste- rich , strong malt flavors . bready , toasty , chocolaty . the cherries from the nose are also present . no real alcohol flavor , though its presence is noticeable in the numbing sensation from over-savoring . swallow is cleansing bitterness into a dry aftertaste , with a hint of chocolate covered cherries , which eventually fades into an alcohol aftertaste . i do n't have a lot of barleywine experience , but this is very rich , deep , and nice tasting . mouthfeel- substantial . this beer is heavy with malt and alcohol , and it feels like it . it is n't overly-heavy , but it is solidly weighty . drinkability- low . the bottle lists the strength at 10.1 % , and it is heavy in malt ; this is n't a session beer , or an every-day beer . but it is a very nice beer , and i will be glad to have some more , some time ."

S"reviewed from notes from 12/30/08 : beer poured into a pint glass . as i am used to west coast ipa 's , i immediately notice the color . it is much more orange than copper . it is much lighter than a racer 5 or certainly green flash . it just does n't look as full bodied as some of the other ipa 's i have tried . i find nothing noteworthy in the nose . a slight piney bitterness from the hops and the alcohol , but nothing much else going on here . taste is good . there is good balance between the malt and the hops . however , i prefer my ipas a bit more hoppy . conversely , the lack of overpowering hop bitterness makes this a very drinkable beer . it is crisp and refreshing and i could down numerous in a sitting . in summary , this would be a solid session beer , but not a beer i would consider memorable in any way . i am sure i am biased , but i believe the ca ipa 's ( racer , green flash and certainly pliny ) compare very favorably to the two hearted ."

S"my girlfriend wanted something to drink , so i got dressed and headed to the convenience store at nearly midnight to grab her a soda . i wanted a beer , and i had a samuel adams holiday porter sitting in the fridge at her house that i could 've enjoyed . but then i spotted steel reserve 211 triple export in the cooler at the store , laughed and remembered the horrible things i 'd heard about 211 , and grabbed a 24 oz . can for $ 1.29 . quite a steal ( pun intended ) . poured what the steel brewing company believes `` to be one of the finest beers in the world '' into a mug . straw yellow in color with a slight , creamy white cap of foam . the head lingers briefly and leaves a few straps of lacing on the glass as it ( uneasily ) goes down . creamed corn , rotten vegetables , sweet molasses and booze attack the nose in a fit of unpleasantry . fairly thick on the tongue , coating the palate with notes of sweet malt , cereal , corn , a middling pinch of bitter hops , and a long , drawn-out fusel alcohol burn that carries through into a dry , dry finish . as the beer warms a little , the alcohol presence becomes overpowering , nearly rendering it undrinkable . it 's a good thing that this brew is high in alcohol content and comes in a big can that can be downed quickly for a good buzz , because it certainly is n't a sipper and letting it warm ever so slightly brings its horrid fusels to the foreground . everything about this beer is laughable from a true appreciator of beer , as the company titles it `` triple export , '' as if it has some high status as an export beer , moving on to describe the production process and the high quality of ingredients , and finishing their lauding with the statement already mentioned earlier . my girlfriend 's cat , who will eat and drink pretty much anything , could n't even stand this stuff . this is nothing but a beer to bomb , not some masterpiece of brewing ingenuity ."

S'22 oz bomber from chucks fine wines . $ 6.99 bottle offers a lot of insight into the beer . contains halterau variations , chocolate , caramel , and 2 row pale malts . 9.5 % abv . 15 degrees l. 20 degrees p. 93 ibu . advises to drink out of a snifter . appearance : bright reddened copper . initially large white head settles to skim . aroma : fruity with lots of caramel and citrus juice . hints of chocoalte . halterau goodness . taste : chocolate ( more then expected ) and caramel body . very juicy as well but individual fruits are difficult to make out because my palate is rather overwhelmed by the bitterness . this could have used some time to meditate , 6 months or maybe even a year . mouthfeel : bitter , american barley wine like . full and strong . as it warms , increasing amounts of bitter fruit and booze come forward turning this more and more into an ipa like beer instead of a red . by the end i can barely taste the chocolate that was so abundant when this was cold . drinkability : ok . this is pretty filling and very bitter . some time would surely help .'

S"living in maryland , near the land of pleasant living ... i have an unusual fondness for ol ' natty boh . by no means do i think that this is a good beer , but i certainly prefer it to the standard bmc 's that you will get at the ballpark . appearance : pours a watery golden color into a clear yellow body . a foamy misleading head quickly dissipates into nothing . smell : sweet malt taste with some wheat . faint aroma overall . taste : taste of corn and sweet malt . much less offensive if you are enjoying one while watching the game . any more attention to the flavor profile reveals a tangy hard to place taste . i would n't call it metallic , but there is something there if you are looking for it . mouthfeel : medium light body with average carbonation . drinkability : i rated the drinkability unusually high due to the nostalgia that natty boh brings . this is by no means a craft beer , but still enjoyable after mowing the lawn or when watching the game . if nothing else , its a good alternative to a bmc when available ."

S"thanks to muenchenerkindl for sending this my way . poured from a 12oz . bottle into my standard shaker `` pint '' glass . appears a deep translucent brown color with about a finger of quickly fading head that settles to about a quarter inch . smells of roasted sweet caramel malts , followed by a hit of hops and a touch of alcohol . tastes of sweet caramel with citrus notes followed by a bitter roasted grain flavor and a slight alcohol burn ( at 5.6 % ? ) . carbonation is completely overdone on this one . very bubbly , so much so that i find it hard to think about anything else while drinking it . got this one in a trade and i 'm far from sad that i was n't sent a pair of these ."

S'bottle : poured a golden color lager with a fizzy pure white head with minimal retention and no lacing . aroma of sweet malt with light corn notes is bland and not that enjoyable . taste is also a bland mix between some sweet malt with light adjunct notes ( i know the label states all-malt lager but i have a hard time believing this ) . body is light with good carbonation . bland lager and not something that need to be revisited .'

S"review is from notes taken on 3/10/2011 and poured from the bottle to a goblet . appearance : pour is a dark apricot/coppery color with lighter orange highlights and it starts with a 1/4 finger creamy off-white head that fades quickly to a thick , but uneven skim hanging around on the surface ; body is fairly hazy and shows moderately slow carbonation bubbling up from the bottom ; only a couple of small spots of lacing are left hanging around on the sides of the glass . smell : first and foremost , i would say there is plenty of belgian yeast flowing out of this one and it has a bit of a smooth banana like aspect to it and is probably the best aspect to it next to the sweet bottle . taste : sad to say it , but it 's a bit of a mess -- lots of the belgian yeast right up front and there 's a super sweet blast of malts ( possibly some candi sugar in there as well ? ) and it turns the stomach a bit as it 's a little too sweet ; then there 's the assault of the strong and grassy hoppiness that one would expect from stone , and if it was n't for unbalanced sweetness , it would probably be pretty good ; definite presence of big alcohol rounds it all out . mouthfeel : body is moderately thick and of medium mouthfeel ; carbonation is smooth and fitting of the body ; a very thick and sticky coating is left all over the palate and the belly is left quite warm from the 12 % abv . drinkability : not too high -- the uber-sweetness turns it and i ca n't finish the bottle . worth trying , but only once ."

S'22 ounce handbottle thanks to steve , one of the sourest beers i have ever drank , it is a pomegranate wild ale produced using a belgian golden strong ale and brettanomyeces lambicus , it has been aged in oak barrels for nearly forty months at the time this was packaged when i poured this brew into my dogfish head snifter tonight , the color was a a mix between an amber and medium orange , big 1 1/2 inch bubbly white head that lasted around five minutes , nice retention , lacing at the top , smell consisted of strong nail polish , pomegranates , cherries , tartiness , citric acid , lemon juice , and vinegar , the flavor literally burns it is so sour , when it is colder it is almost hard to swallow , great fruit flavors all identified in the smell , tarty finish is most admirable part of the beer leaving a crackling on the tongue with acidic pomegranates and cherries , liked how the fruit took over as it warmed and the sourness mellowed slightly , mouthfeel was very tart , almost stingy , puckering sour makes this name appropriate , medium body , one of the most carbonated beers i have seen as well , tried to drink the bomber by myself but only got through sixteen ounces , not heavy or anything just flat out acidic , not a bad thing either , went down a lot easier when swished around a little bit in the mouth , also once it warmed too , could drink a fair amount over a longer period of time , would love to try this again in a few years , especially because the same culture is used and just added onto , i think it is already three or four years old , highly recommended'

S"i saw this in a gas station for $ 1 , and i guess curiosity got the best of me . a - it is actually a very good looking beer . it pours a beautiful red , ultra-translucent hue , with a small cap of tan foam . poor retention and no lace . s - it smells , initially , of bug spray . after it airs out overnight , it just smells like someone broke a bottle of vanilla extract . neither is a good thing . not surprisingly , there is no bourbon or wood . t - aged in bourbon casks ? i ca n't imagine ab swallowing the opportunity cost of having vats of beer just sitting around , taking up space for months . this beer tastes like a really mild ale with a ridiculous amount of vanilla extract dumped in the glass . have you ever been in the kitchen , making some recipe , and accidentally you use too much vanilla extract and ruin everything ? the definition of unbalanced . m - thin beer , but ok in the feel dept . d - not drinkable whatsoever ."

S"well , i 'd say this beer would probably be pretty decent for a summer beer at a party , but like previously stated in most reviews , it 's definitely not an ipa in any way , shape , or form . the color is extremely light , that of a pilsner or light lager , although it 's definitely a bit more flavorful than the color leads you to think . the head disappeared literally within a few seconds after i poured it , which is kinda strange . it does n't have that bitter hoppiness of an ipa , or the slightly elevated abv - i know it 's english-style , but it just simply does n't meet the requirements of any kind of ipa . so , if you 're looking for something that 'll please non-craft drinkers for a summer party , like a barbecue or something ( and you do n't want to resort to budweiser or any of that garbage ) , this beer is alright . but if you 're looking for a real ipa , look elsewhere ."

S"although this is a good ale , i 'm attempting to be objective to rate it in the context of the style , rather than as a stand-alone rating . pours a foggy orange-copper color , with a minimal head that leaves small bits of lacing . the aroma is rather bland for an ipa , but there are the characteristic floral hops and a tinge of red grapefruit . the taste is also somewhat bland for an ipa that claims to be `` bursting with hops '' . there 's just no burst here . it 's almost like a slightly watered-down ipa . i detect a hint of sour green apple among the floral hoppiness , and the hop taste is not `` fresh '' . it 's like they used hops that they had left over from last year . i do n't know what the ibu on this ipa is , but it 's not what it should be in my opinion . the mouthfeel is ... please forgive the overuse of this adjective ... bland . not acidic enough . not carbonated enough . maybe i got a bad bottle , but it just did n't `` do it for me '' as far as an ipa is concerned . give me dogfish head 's 90-minute or breckenridge 471 any day over this . drinkability is not too bad , since you can drink these like water if you want to pound some beers .. but i can think of better ( and cheaper ) session ales . all in all , not a *bad* beer . it 's actually quite good . but for an ipa - just does n't meet the standards of the style ."

S"retired ? they still have a few bottles at the packies around beantown . anyway , there 's nary a pop when you open the cork , and this ... beverage pours an opaque umber/black with no head . in fact , no carbonation . none . not a single bubble . very strong aromas of molasses , pumpernickel , chocolate , and dried berries . mouthfeel is thick and viscous , slippery and oily - tastes like molasses and pumpernickel with a sweet alcohol kick - actually quite smooth in that regard , the alcohol is less `` hot '' than even in most wines . overall , i just do n't quite know what 's up with this `` beer . '' it 's completely flat , has no hop taste or aroma whatsoever , and is n't even particularly bittered . really it tastes more like a molasses wine than anything . which is nice i suppose , but certainly not what i was looking for in a triple bock ( or an american strong ale for that matter ) ."

S"this beer looks like a slightly cloudy mainstream pilsner poured into my pint glass , albeit one with a luxuriously creamy head . the hop aroma is intense , even for this american ipa man . it 's dry , and very , very hoppy , but that 's kinda the point . i 'd say this beer is not complex at all -- you 've got citrusy hops to the max , with little malt for balance ( picture a teeter-totter with you at 5 years old on one side , and your dad on the other ) . that being said , it goes down incredibly easy . i would n't believe the 8 % claim at 2/3 of the way through , but then again , i 'm still sitting down . it 's dry , and hoppy . and that 's about it . this , to me , is a perfect beer for summer ball games -- it 's not challenging for your taste buds , is ridiculously easy to drink , and not that expensive . it 's what i 'd give at the park to a guy that says he likes hops , but does n't want to be challenged . nothing going on here but them . it sure ai n't snooty . sometimes that 's a good thing . not a beer snob 's beer by any means , but with a name like hop stoopid , you only expect one note . and that 's what you get . lagunitas delivers it like zz top or ac/dc . they 've only got one song , but it 's a damn good one ."

S"poured with a very lively tannish head with a dark ruby brown color . the aroma smells like freshly milled grain with some salty-worchestshire sauce and hints of sweet sugaryhints in the background . sweet , too sweet , almost taste like ... yup ... unferemented wort , with some astringent grainy taste . not much co2 at all and once you get past the worty taste it 's not a thick as i thought it would be . absolutly no hops detected at all , definetly could have used some . i definetly agree with another ba 's comment about using this as a marinade , it 's the only thing i think i 'm gon na do with the rest of 6'er i got ."

S'served in a half-pint glass at the bow bar in edinburgh . a : very pale ; a light , sickly yellow . the sparse head has admirable retention . s : not very strong . lemon-citrus . faint , piny hops . vaguely reminiscent of lemon pinesol . t : actually rather nice ! very light . the maintaste is characterised by citrus flourishes with hops on the finish . other than that , not a lot going on . the aftertaste is just barely bitter . m : thin and plain . d : light and enjoyable . not recommended , but unobjectionable in every way .'

S"clear copper with a medium , creamy head . aroma is.. well weak . touch of a euro-lagery smell and a cleanness . not much else . taste is grain and a tiny bitterness . although the initial head was n't great , there 's some really good lacing happening now . perhaps my pour was to blame . a bit of a citrusy taste , but overall not a terribly flavourful brew . moderate carbonation and a light-medium body . quite drinkable , but nothing special in my view"

S'poured on a hazy memorial day ... and appeared - deep black with a chocolaely head and lacing that continued throughout , as any nitro stout should . smelled - as if they were only calling it a dry stout , but were playing around with chocolate covered espresso beans near the tanks . i was enticed . tasted - quite good , while it is hard to impress me with a non-specialty stout , this seemed a bit more than a plain , irish dry ( read : guiness ) . so , i was very happy about that . mouthfeel - was on style , but it is especially always fun to poke througha creamy head like that . that has got to be taken as part of the mouthfeel experience , imo . drinkability - is likely long , even though i only had one . if you like dry stouts , this is certainky better than any of the irish macro dries .'

S"pint bottle . $ 3.39 or $ 3.99 at new england beverage co. in orange , ct. second tasting . this is the 'wolznacher hell ' without the 'naturtrb . ' not sure if there 's much of a difference . pours a friendly amber with a head that will more than likely require a pause in your pour . decent retention , had to work through a little bit of it to get to the beer in a standard pilsner glass . eventually settles down to about 1/8 '' of a nice foamy layer atop the beer . minimal lacing . large chunks of yeast float freely at the bottom of the glass . smell is rather neutral . almost undetectable hops.. some spiciness . nothing too profound . i gave my dad a sip of this one because he 's compared just about every beer i 've given him to schneider aventinus or schneiderweisse , which is his favorite beer -- even though he 's moved on to mostly drinking single malts . sure enough , 'reminds me of schneider weisse . ' what does n't ? he liked it , though . i told him i wanted to get another bottle and cellar it , but this was the last one in the store . he made some comment about how drinking 'two of those would get ( me ) all screwed up . ' at 4.7 % ? he understimates me . as for the taste , there 's really not much to it . i 've actually been tempted to add a little lemon or lime to this beer at the end . there 's no bitterness whatsoever and neither the hops nore the malt really stand out . nevertheless , it 's not watery in the least . just a very mild citrus tart/tinge from the hops . i 'm not sure why they have them on the bottle , though . as you near the end of his brew , note the density of the yeast on the bottom of your glass . i 've only had two bottles , but there was a mound about 1/4 '' tall at the bottom of one and nowhere near as much in the second . this is definitely a great starter beer , and a good beer for just about anything . very refreshing , just nothing that really smacks you in the face as being particularly memorable . i will be buying it again ."

S'12oz clear orange and slightly carbonated with a creamy yet sparse and thin head made up of various sized bubbles . spotty lacing . delicious aroma of extremely green high-acid hops . minor notes of caramel and butterscotch . positively spellbinding . light body is deceptive - struck with a left hook by a blinding bitterness in this beer . very chalky and actively strips the skin from the cheek interiors . fresh.. somewhat like eating the leaves off a tomato plant . wish this had a little more balancing maltiness.. however , i can see this being a very enjoyable , drinkable beer for masochistic hopheads . smells great but not in my top 10 ipas .'

S"appearance : pale orange with a small lacy head . aroma : butter , fruits and toffee . taste : smooth and easy drinking ... some fruits and buttery-biscuits . overall : i love scottish beers , but this one is not a `` scotch '' ale , nor is it a classic christmas ale . it is an easy drinking session beer ( more of a spring ale if you ask me ) that they are marketing as a christmas ale . i have been to scotland and can say that their beers are terribly underrated in the us , but they are actually good , and this one is no different . again , not a christmas ale so if that is what you are looking for , go elsewhere , but if you want an easy drinking session beer at a good price , this one is worth a try . cheers ! !"

S"i 'm just now getting into stouts . i was biased because i 'm not really a guinness fan . here goes ! i 'm pouring from a 1pt 6oz bottle at 54.3 degrees into a 16oz pint glass . as far as appearance , this is a beautiful beer ! completely black with a very thick , frothy , two-finger head . the head is a light brown that sticks around . it reminds me of soy sauce , the way it pours . the smell is overwhelmingly hoppy . the bottle boasts a large amount of hops and i do n't think i 'm going to be disappointed in that aspect of this beer . i detect a little sweetness going on , maybe toffee or chocolate . i 'm a little apprehensive to taste this one . i 've only heard good things , from fellow ba 's as well as my trusted beer store employees . this one takes me by surprise ! i was right about the toffee and chocolate , but there 's also a heavy coffee influence . at 9.5abv , i thought i would be able to taste the alcohol more , but i 'm pleasantly surprised ! the alcohol is still there , but there 's so much more going on in my mouth that it 's more of a side note than a distraction ! very well done ! starts with a little bitterness , but moves to a very smooth , woodsy hoppiness that is complimented nicely by the roasting ! wow . wow ... .wow ! the carbonation reminds me of a nitrogen pushed beer ( belhaven , guinness ) , but not as thick . very smooth , though a little thick for how heavy the beer is . maybe its just me , but i like the contrasy of heavy , yet watery beers ( see guinness 250 ) . as far as drinkability , i would say i like this one more than i like most stouts i 've tried , though that list is very short . i will buy more of this one , but mostly because i want to drink it with friends and share its uniqueness with them ."

S"had the traditional pale color of hazy golden blond with a nice 2 fingers of creamy white head that stayed around for the entire beer and left quite a bit of lacing . the smell is why i ordered the beer , i could seriously smell the beer from a meter away ... so of course i have to inquire into this beer . up close your nose is bombarded by citrusy hops , and it is hard to pick any other smells out . with that thick creamy foam still on top i dived in , who does n't look cool with a beer foam mustache ? the flavor had that sweet citrus flavor that i was expecting but was balanced with some bitter hops that made for a complex hop battle between bittering and aroma hops . the hopslam has a full bodied feel , very nice . drinkablitiy is a little on the low end , cause i need to be able to function after ... 10 % ! are you kidding ? ? ?"

S"served in a 12oz . bottle . the beer is pale , translucent , yellow in color . shake the bottle a little , and the beer fizzes and gathers bubbles , more like ginger ale than a beer . the smell is faint and characteristically pungent of american lager . not a lot to report , but not unappetizing either . there is almost no taste save for an earthy , bitterish after-taste . it has a great deal more flavor than a typical grocery store light beer , but i feel like i am drinking a good beer watered down . the mouthfeel is fizzy like soda water . although coors is the `` banquet beer , '' this feels rather like that - it has the consistency of cheap champagne . the strength of the beer is that it is so easy to drink . the watery flavor and soda-like feel make it a pretty mediocre beer , but it also makes it extraordinarily easy to drink . when i want a cheap , easy-drinking beer , mgd is what i go for . the taste is not overwhelmingly bad as with other beers like bud light etc. , and in big gulps the beer flows down very smoothly . the colder the better ."

S"had this on-tap at novare res this past weekend . pours a hazy golden orange-ish color , decent sized fluffy looking head and leaves some lacing . smell is rather tame for a belgian style beer , light citrusy/yeasty aroma and sweet malt , but the aroma is barely present for something that is pound you over the head like most belgian styles . taste is rather light and not very flavorful , mostly a yeasty presence accompanied with some citrus and a dash of orange , the good thing is that it 's feels rather creamy and soft and tends to be easily drinkable , i think i went through a pint in under 5 minutes , although it 's not a very adventurous beer which might be the case . i have to say i 'm a bit underwhelmed with this beer though , especially since it 's replacing the portsmouth lager , one of the better year round lagers available ."

S"purchased at 101 bottles in kent . not cheap at $ 4.99 for a single 12oz bottle . poured into a cigar city snifter . the beer is quite thick and ropey coming out of the bottle . immediately a tall dark head rises , though it does n't last more than a moment . the head is made up of large ugly soapy bubbles . it is uncouth and ill-mannered . get your shit in order stone ! troegs , i am looking at you too ! ( not sure who jason fields and kevin sheppard are - the bottle does n't explain ) . smells good enough . like a heavy dark stout . roast is there , but chocolate and smooth maltiness is most apparent . i actually do n't mind the aroma at all , though so far i am getting no real cherry here . the tastes starts to show the beer 's real weakness though . while it begins with a nice punch of gritty cocoa powder and thick malty awesomeness , the beer grows in an odd juiciness . there 's really no true cherry flavor here . lots of people have been mentioning cherry cough syrup . i think that assessment is both harsh and non-realistic . what one is left with however , is the feel of bitter , tongue curling cough medicine . it 's a matter of feel more than taste for me . vanilla is n't much of an influence either . quite simply , this beer just does n't deliver . so , mouthfeel ? not quite right ... as i stated , the feel is both really dry , and really juicy/sticky/medicinal . i truly hope that fresh cherries were not used here . if so , they were done a severe injustice . overall the beer is not as bad as some have claimed , but it certainly is another miss in a long line of poor beers from stone this year . also most definitely not worth the heavy price tag on the single i bought . and hell , the proceeds from this beer do n't even go to charity . meh'num'gnum'gumb ... ."

S"the only time i ever had this was when i turned 19 . my buddies and i ventured north to windsor , ontario canada for a few pints at patrick o'ryans irish pub . being the red beer lover that i am the first thing i ordered was a pint of beamish irish red . it thought it looked awesome , a slightly brownish dark red with a somewhat thin creamy head on it . the beer didnt quite taste as good as it looked , but it was still quite pleasently sweet and i highly enjoyed the creamy mouthfeel it had . the only downside it had was that after about 2 of these the sweetness of the beer would really start to get to you and you 'd pass it off for the night after that . this was a 1 beer , beer . but a damn fine one in my book . though for some reason i guess there are very few red beer lovers out there anymore , and the pub got rid of it . i feel lucky that i get the chance to enjoy it while i could though . because now that i 'm 21 the entire country north of us is obsolete to me anyway . still searching for it in michigan , the only thing from the beamish line i 've found is their irish stout which is pretty good by the way ."

S'2001 vintage . appearance : body is thick and viscous , just about as opaque as they come , the blackest shade of burgundy . even though i poured as vigorously as i could , there is virtually no head , just a thin layer of creamy tan froth that disappears quickly . smell : wow . loads of anise , port , dark chocolate , espresso , cabernet sauvignon , and raisins . mild woody , resiny , almost maple syrupy notes in the background . a drop of soy sauce . alcohol is quite subdued . awesome . taste : alas , my nose seems to have misled my tongue . a strong , intrusive , almost bile-like sourness permeates the palate and pummels whatever more pleasant flavors this ale might have had to offer . otherwise , it is roasty , dark chocolatey , and very red wine-like , with robust dark fruit flavors . a slight saltiness accents the sour sharpness . overall , fairly acrid and not very good . mouthfeel : flat carbonation and surprisingly thin body . puckering and drying from the sourness . drinkability : well shit , i was really looking forward to this one , especially after smelling it . it could be that this was a bad year , or that the beer does not age well in general , or that this had been improperly stored prior to my purchase , so i would like to try a fresher bottle . but from this experience ... i can not recommend it , no matter how pleasant the aroma .'

S'wierd . an impressive deep copper colour , but not much head . smells like wine , with traces of spice . it taste very similar to wine , or even alcoholic grape juice , with hints of plum , spices , raisin and even coffee in the background . very interesting . carbonation is good , but this beer seems at times too sweet and wine-like . the richness and higher than typical strength will probably limit me to one of these a session .'

S'appearance : i poured the ipa hard into a pint glass revealing its beautiful snow white creamy chunky head . its color is a golden orange , clear and clean , and left amazing lacing all the way down . smell : huge aroma : flowery citrus and fruits such as apples up front . sweet honeysuckle and candied fruits on the end . taste : an amazing tasting beer ; sweet citrus and orange zest with big apricot . bittering tart and sweet finish ; big hops and great flavors . no metalic tastes often found in super hoppy beers . mouthfeel : big and drying , with fine carbonation aiding the creamy head . the size stands up to the flavor . drinkability : low to medium ; this is a heavy and hoppy beer . this is not for beginners . notes : great example of an american ipa . great lakes come through with a win ; again !'

S'very dark reddish brown color , with a nice , sticky head that dissipates intoa thin persistent sheet . aroma is thickly malty , with a subtle alcohol sweetness underneath . taste is pure straightforward sweetness , just straight ahead dough and caramel malt sweetness . the sweetness , and the milky mouthfeel , make this one just too syrupy . drinkability -- not a doppelbock i would seek out , and i love the doppel .'

S"from notes . dark brown with some light around the edges when backlit . fizzy tan head fades fast . no lacing . chocolate syrup and not much else . with a swirl , i get faint booze and a light whiff of base grains . better than the nose , but not much . chocolate syrup and something sorta dark fruity trying to poke through . way to sweet and chocolate syrupy ! too much carbonation tingle , medium body , and a bit of viscosity . more warming than i 'd expect for its size . or is that that overly strong carbonation ? i support being creative and experimental . but whose idea was it ot dump a bunch of hershey 's syrup in what may have been a decent beer ? very disappointing . i do n't do drain pours , but if i did , i would have . not at all enthused about finishing this ."

S"opening this bottle , i was very stoked . i happen to love what stone has to offer , especially their little write-ups about their beer on the bottle..always make me laugh . as i poured it , it poured an amber color which left very little head . it did give some nice lacing on the glass , but not much to it . the scent was by far the most impressive part of this ale . as i sat a good foot away , i could get good hints of caramel and a bit of fruit ( undistinguishable to me however ) . also , the hops were apparent in odor as well . i could definitely taste the caramel on the initial sip , and the hops also hit well towards the back of the sip , which was a nice thing ! the malty caramel taste stands out the most to me . carbonation was not overbearing , especially drank at room temp , and mouthfeel was pretty good ... slightly creamy to me somehow ... . overall , this beer i rate as good ... not the best ale i have ever had . i 'd much rather have an arrogant bastard though ."

S'by the way , i drank this with some venison tonight . went very well together ! in fact , i highly recommend it ! poured from a 750ml bottle to give a rich ( can not see thru ) caramel color with a full head . i poured this into a larger tulip and i got a fairly large head ( almost 2 inches ) . my first smells were of nothing but malt . i decided it was too cold so i drank it down letting the bottle warm up for my second try . as i enjoyed my venison chops ... 1st pour : taste a little bit of the raisin but i really had to try hard . had no mouthfeel whatsoever . alcohol taste afterwards must have attributed to the dryness . 2nd pour ( same bottle ) : poured better with only a 1 inch head ( same glass ) . now , the smells really came out of apple , raisins , and nutty malt . the taste really exploded of fruit . i can not tell between raisin or apples . still a dry after taste , but i can not sense the alcohol , very well hidden . feels thinner this time than the last . i enjoyed this beer even though i am not a brown ale person .'

S"wow , certainly not your dinner brew . thick , black , not very carbonated , smooth feel . i got a fairly thin head off an average poor . extremely malty with heavy coffee and chocolate flavors . strong though , some alcohol from the 9.2 % , mild hoppiness did not distract . this is a power malt brew . i took about 30 minutes or so to work through my glass , and loved going back and breathing in the aroma . truly a very nice evening brew , but certainly not for the faint of heart . what 's funny is that when i tried guinness extra stout this is what i was looking for , bold , malty , thick , smooth"

S"an idahoan adding an anheuser-busch product ... i 'm as surprised as you are ... . a work buddy knows i 'm into good beer and gifted me 2 of these bottles ... he lives next door to a local distributor big wig and randy decided he needed to give me a couple of these because he needed a ride home sunday night before he went on vacation ... badass ! ! edit 1 : despite my less than stellar review of this beer , i honestly expect that ba 's are gon na give this one a fair shake and my review will ultimately be on the low end of the spectrum . poured into a clean and dry shaped sa glass ... 1 finger head foams up and drops back sorta slowly ... the beer itself is as the label says ... sorta pale orange/deep gold with a thick haze to it ... no real lace.. and the cap is lite but persistent . the nose has the advertised lite citrus peel and even less ( but present ) coriander .. a sorta musty grainy element separates this one from a traditional wit almost out of the gate.. none of the yeasty components expected from anything using a belgian wit yeast ... come on ... ab certainly has the facilities to use different yeast strains ... someone at least needs to try a bit . funny.. i expected more from this from the nose.. the flavors are sorta shallow throughout.. lite malty sweetness has some pronounced `` wheaty '' flavors with just an edge of citrus and again much less coriander.. the maltiness has a sorta soggy darker bread element in my mind.. the flavors are pretty flat.. i was hoping for a slightly sour yeasty element . the body is still light but lends itself up a notch or two by a lighter than expected carbonation.. and i swear all the yeast poured into the glass makes it a bit thicker ... i am honestly a little surprised by this one ... i did have the bud light lime a time or three after friends leave them in the fridge ... . and this is significantly better than the bll.. but overall , nothing i would ever buy again at a store ... maybe a bar if it is the only thing that looked refreshing on a very hot day ... however , i would never scoff if i happened upon a bottle ... it 's by no means a traditional wit ... . but it 's still an okay beer and pretty damn drinkable while i 'm doing some lnlw ( late night lawn watering : - ) edit 2 : looking online.. this one is n't going to be released until early october ... and with a $ 30,000,000 marketing campaign ... jesus christ.. a tiny fraction of that and i 'll tell you this should have been released in late may ... these type"

S"this brew was up and down for me . one of the most drastic change in rankings for every category of any beer i 've gobbled to this point . as high as 4.5 in appearance , and mouthfeel and as low as 2.5 in drinkability as this beer just doesnt know which way its going , lacking direction in my opinion . it started with an outstanding pour . beautiful frothy white head that laces the glass extremely well . not sure how they could improve the appearance although it does look highly carbonated smelled like it has hop extract infused in this baby with a heavy malty , earthy type background . huh ? exactly . tasted same as smell ... .something like a huge double ipa and then it fades into this confused burnt malt flavor then back to the bitter hops . mouthfeel was excellent . a creamy massaging oily type presence that was pleasant . the high carbonation i see in the appearance does not bother the palate at all as it comes accross tame . just a confusing beer all around for me ... loved parts of it hated others . i would get this again , especially if i see it on tap ."

S'nice brown pour with a little head that remains for about half the beer smells of caramel malts spices and hops tastes of sweet malts caramel and spices then comes the tsunami of hops finishes very bitter and wipes out the pleasing complexity of the malts alittle light for a brown ale in my experience and personally this is the last one ill ever pick up well what can i say rogue ruins another beer with excessive hops i love hoppy beer much more than malty beer but i think that just adding excessive hops always kills it if i was you i wouldnt waste my time with this one'

S'this beer pours an inky black . light tries in vain to penetrate the blackness . its an act in futility . crowning the blackness is a dark khaki head . the head falls to a ring , but leaves plenty of lace down the glass . the aroma packs a wallop . solid coffee and dark chocolate . plenty of black strap molasses present as well . a light bit of fruitiness - black currents - rounds things out . as the beer warms noticeable solvent alcohol aromas show up as well . the flavor is equally impressive . loads of coffee waft over the tongue . plenty of dark chocolate is present as well . molasses soaked coffee beans and a hint of liquorice seem to round out the middle . as the beer warms up , the alcohol starts to show up . the finish packs plenty more roast , as well as a bit of a lingering herbal hop note . the mouthfeel is full bodied and thick . the beer coats the tongue in velvety bliss . the carbonation is light but more than adequate for the job . man oh man is this one epic brew . its a sipper to be sure . loads of complexity await each delicious sip . its very easy drinking upfront . the alcohol seems almost non existent . as the beer warms up , the alcohol becomes much more prevalent . the last few sips definitely have an alcohol bite . all in all though this is still one incredible brew .'

S"pours from the tap into a goblet a dark cloudy brown ; it has a dense , thick head that evaporates quickly and leaves an attractive skim on the top of the beer . the aroma is strong with honey , clove , cinnamon . there is a slight dark fruitiness : cherry , plumb . the taste is very `` in your face '' with both spice and alcohol . it is a very strong array of spices : nutmeg , cardamom , clove , cinnamon , honey . the fruitiness remains in the taste : elements of the orange as well as berry or lighter/sweeter fruit ( apple , pear ? ) come through . there is some bitterness and a toasty malt taste . overall it is well blended but intense set of tastes . it has elements of a bock beer , traditional warmer , and strong spiced ale . compared to other warmers which attempt to hint around at the spice ... this puts that element right up front . it is tingly and bubbly in the mouth and down the throat . this would normally lead to higher drinkability . but the lingering strong alcohol presence seems to make the mouth feel a bit more astringent . and that makes it only moderately drinkable . it was unique for"

S"my excitement in trying this beer is only matched by my disappointment with how it tasted . i have had many pumpkin ales , but this one really tastes nasty , and has a yuck aroma as well . here is my review . a : starts off nice , with a pretty half inch white head on top of a golden , pumpkin ( what else ! ) color . almost like a jack-o-lantern in a glass . unfortunately , that was only good thing about this beer , imo . s : it wants to smell like pumpkin pie ; but fails . instead , i get a soggy breakfast cereal- maybe golden grahams ? what happened to aromas of pumpkin pie spice ? the smell is very off-putting , but i 've got a bomber so i 'll continue . t : yuk . strident bitterness , from the alcohol , maybe ? more cheap breakfast cereal . this is possibly the worst pumpkin ale i 've ever had , and i 've tried most of them . i do n't even think i 'll make it through one glass , let alone the entire bomber . m : decent . slightly prickly from the carbonation . warming in the mouth , but that funky cereal remnant aftertaste remains . d : this is just terrible . a waste of $ 7 . if you really want a nice pumpkin ale , stick with cottonwood . it is by far the best one out there ."

S"presentation : 12 oz . brown bottle , twist-off cap appearance : a fairly vigorous pour produces a brilliantly clear , dark brown beer with a fluffy light-tan head that soon reduces to a thin cap . smell : the primary aromas are of sweet caramel and roasted malts . not too much in the hops department . taste : lighter on the palate than i expected . the flavors are tasty , but overly simple , and not that inspiring . there are light flavors of roasted grains in here , but other than that , there 's not a lot going on . the finish is dry , with a touch of roasted bitterness and mild hopping . mouthfeel : fairly light , with a crisp finish . drinkability : goes down really easy , there 's not much to it . conclusion : it does n't taste bad , but there 's nowhere near the depth of flavor that the color of the beer suggests . it makes me wonder if they might have used some color extract or a significant portion of adjunct grains/sugars in here ? i 'd choose this beer over a bmc beer of any persuasion , just because it has a little more body and just a hint of roasted barley , but , that being said , i probably wo n't buy this again ."

S"12 oz bottle ( screw top ? ! ? ) with a best before date of 8-28-2011 , so this is fresh ... a - dark mahogany almost masks the crazy carbonation beneath . huge tan head parks on top refusing to give . s - grassy with figs , raisins , and cloves in the initial pickup . floral hop background and yeast round this one out . t - dark cherries and some chocolate with alcohol expected and only slightly noticed when it creates the belly warmth . sweet with dark fruit and clean . m - classic belgian mega-carbonation and yeasty body make this one a mouthful , literally . d - @ 9 % abv it 's moderate to low , but it is n't out of character for this style at all ."

S"this beer is one of my favorites , when it pours into a glass with a orange like color . the taste is amazing , and the aroma is a citrus wheat . especially when the glass is decorated with the wedge of an orange . this just happens to be one of my favorite beers . i always buy this beer in bottles , i 've heard that their is a significant difference when the beer is on tap . some may disagree with me about the taste but i am for this beer 100 % , unlike some of blue moons seasonal , this taste remains to be one of my favorites . the only down side of this beer in my opinion is its drinkability seems to be a bit on the filling side ."

S"sampled december 2009 the cap comes off safely enough , but i get this into my large tripel karmeliet tulip and end up with seven fingers of foam that continuously spews foam over the sides . finally settles down enough to take away from the sink and i have a picturesque tall head that sits about an inch above the rim of my glass . in the bottle the beer was actually pretty clear , but after pouring , the beer is a reddish , darkish amber hue that shows a hazed , pink-orange , amber hue when held up to the light . as the head slowly subsides it leaves a nice , layered , lacing pattern on the sides of my glass and the head is very structure forming mesas that have quite some staying power . visually , you ca n't ask for much more from a beer of this type . the aroma is musty with a woody peppery note , a faint tartness ( a touch of lemon perhaps ) and a grassy-earthy grain note that dominates the finish . very rustic and earthy smelling , but also bone dry smelling , this is a very nice smelling beer . light , a touch fizzy ( it has sat long enough in my glass that it has loss much of the excess carbonation ) and it has a dry , grassy grain finish as well as a touch of phenolic clove and a very faint tartness ( much of which could just come from the wheat ) . there are some light apple and pear notes here , but this is dry enough of a beer that it is very subtle . earthy , slightly musty notes perhaps signal a touch of brettanomyces character , but this is very faint and only at the beginning stages of funkification . there is a very grounded , earthy , woody pepper note here that is only lightly spicy . the malt actually almost has a savoriness to it that is brought out by the dryness ; there is a nice pale grain cracker note , a touch of hay and some freshly threshed wheat notes . much of the spiciness is from the wild fermentation character ( even if it is a touch tame ) ; there is definitely quite a bit of phenolics in this beer , it is a touch clove like , but mostly a bit plastic like , or even a touch solvent like , butt this last is definitely quite faint . the oak plays a definite supporting role here , it is almost hard to even recognize underneath the steady , earthy funkiness , but it does accentuates a light , overall spiciness , the touch of woody character , as well as some tannic astringency towards the finish . the texture of this beer is definitely light , this is a beer meant to be quaffed , but it does"

S"jay baum , brewer at crown city fancied up to some of us ba 's on a pasadena crawl . decided to break out his first saison , which he produced in 1997 . the appearance was a golden yellow-ish . cloudy with a small head . the aroma was fruity , sour grape , little apple jolly rancher . samll hop and clove . the taste was spicy , malty and sour fruit . light in body and very drinkable ."

S"light amber with an orange hue ; thick , smooth white head . nutmeg and cinnamon spiciness dominate the nose , with a little malty sweetness underneath . low carbonation ; mouthfeel is quite slick and creamy . the pumpkin spices are also the dominant feature of the taste ; what 's nice is that you get the essence of pumpkin pie without the sweetness ( i do n't find this a particularly malty beer ) . a crisp hop bitterness follows the spiciness , and the spices return going into a relatively short finish . a fall seasonal that would also be a nice treat on a winter 's night . i 'll be picking up more of this brew ."

S'shady brown with ruby highlights.. hazy enough to blur the image of unionmade on the other side . bubbles crowded around the surface edge , the swirly haze of strong beer comfortably nestled in the middle . caramel and brown sugar baked goods nose . burnt rock candy crystals and fruity english malt . sensory pleasure . bitter and somewhat medeival in its aged hoppiness . very aggressive but a crisp , bubbly body makes up for it . raisiny with charred wood notes in the finish . delicious although not the most drinkable for its lower strong-ale abv .'

S"picked this up as part of a mixed six this weekend . it pours out ok with a fair amount of head , unfortunately that does n't last long . there is some pretty decent lacing around the edges and the carbonation seems to be appropriate for the style . the aroma is very faint , i mean it 's so faint i literally stuck my nose in it trying to get something besides a slight bit of cocoa/ coffee and mild malt . the flavor is a creamy light chocolate milk with slight hints of a sourness that actually adds a bit of character to an otherwise mostly boring flavor profile . the mouthfeel is a bit light for what i expect from a porter . overall ... i 'm not sure why but this beer actually grew on me near the end . i do n't know if it was the lack of any dominating flavors but it did seem to be fairly easy to throw it back ."

S"pours a hazy yellow with a big , quick rush of bubbles resulting in a mountain of white head which peaks well above the rim . retention is excellent , with some wavy , thick sheets of lace forming right above the cloud of head which is left behind . aroma involves lemon , coriander , apples and wheat . tastes a slight bit tangy , but not as bold as the smell . there 's also some subtle sweet malts , lemon and then small amounts of coriander finishing things off . this beer could use a bit more umph in the taste department , but its light-bodied and superbly drinkable , which can lead to a perfect fit for some occasions ."

S"12 oz bottle into a tulip glass . freshness date clearly marked . appearance is decent , dark brown in color with ruby highlights and very little head despite a heavy pour . a few spots of lace here and there but not much . smell is nutty and a little bit earthy with maybe some coffee in there . hops are barely detectable . taste is of roasted malts with a some carmel and little dark chocolate that does n't sink in til later . hop character is mild at best , with only a hint of bitterness in the finish . if it were n't for the strong roasted character i 'd almost think this was an english brown ale . body is a little thin for an oatmeal stout , but it still has the smoothness . carbonation feels a little too heavy for this style i think . this beer goes down pretty easy . considering that plus it 's lighter body and low abv i 'd say this is clearly a session beer . i 'd certainly buy this again , i just would n't get too excited about it ."

S"a : deep mahogany brown body with a good one-finger head , exceptional lacing and cap . s/t : oh my . sweet caramel malts , some absolutely wonderful dark fruit , with a wonderfully pungent floral hop presence . i pay a lot of attention to the oak , which actually manages to overshadow the hops to a certain extent on the taste with a nice vanilla goodness , which complements the dark fruit very well . m : great , fully body with a nice , extended finish . d : who can ever complain about anything with the words `` arrogant bastard '' in its title ? it 's complex , yet smooth , yet full and robust . a bit sweeter than the original , but quite the experience , nonetheless ."

S"light copper colored brew with great clarity and tons of bubbles . pours a thick and creamy white foam which actually sticks around pretty well . exceptional appearance for a light beer . not much to say about the aroma . very clean and grainy . taste is actually descent . by far the best light beer i have ever had . mostly smooth and cream malt flavor comes through . hops are subtle but there with a mild bite which is short lived . the best part is the lack of corn and rice adjunct flavors that taint the flavor of macro lights . mouthfeel is light-bodied as expected and tingly from the bubbles . nice smooth finish . drinkablity for this one is actually exceptional due to the lightness and the fact that i do n't want to dump it down the drain after the first sip . strickly comparing it to other light beers , this is outstanding ! not a lot of complex flavors but no offensive flavors either . well done !"

S"poured into a stein , it 's a nice looking , reddish brown beer , but clear - not at all cloudy . not much carbonation and almost no head at all . the nose is a combination of alcohol , spice , nuttiness and a touch of cereal or bread . the flavor is a bit much . initially the nose translates directly to the palate . overwhelming nut/bread and alcohol flavor , which is folowed up with a syrupy sweet aftertaste which is just too much and not unlike brandy . the mouthfeel is quite thick and syrupy as well . they just took this beer too far . it 's not the high abv either . it 's as if they fermented maple syrup and bottled it . i 'm not a big fan of doppelbocks but this is definitely my least favorite thusfar . i 'll give it another shot a year from now and see if it improves , but at this point , it 's not a recommended purchase ."

S"purchased in a 40 oz . growler at the boise co op . great deal on this beer , about $ 6.50 ... i like sockeye 's beers , and it 's great to see some bottles available retail since they do n't have a full time bottling operation . this is pretty much exactly what i like in my winter beers . warming alcohol , complex flavor profile , and heavy coating mouthfeel . great to drink in front of a raging fire . i drank this in two sessions , two thirds of the beer i had one night and the rest the next day . a lot of the carbonation was gone , but the flavor was fine ... winterfest poured with a lasting ample head and had great lacing . dark amber in color , head was a light brown . the flavors in this beer are pretty complex . it had a near-perfect balance of malt and hops , with flavors of pine , raisin , rum , and even coconut . the coconut really surprised me , but after reading another review of this beer that mentioned this as part of the observed flavor profile it 's pretty obvious . this is very much like a barleywine in nature . alcohol is present and apparent , but not overwhelming . does n't have the greatest drinkability in the world but that by no means prevents you from drinking a couple of these . has a coating , somewhat sticky mouthfeel with a pleasant but fairly non descript aftertaste . definitely worth a try ."

S"pours a golden colour , with medium white head that sinks steadily , and quite dense . bead is strong , moderate speed and kind of cool . lace is minimal , quite thin but seems sticky . fairly good for what it be . nose is tangy , with an artificial citrus character , fairly lemon-sherbet-esque , with none of the bitter rind kind of aroma you get from citric hops , just very sweet with a slight bit of zest . delivers what it promises , i guess , but i feel the 'lemon and/or lime ' character can be better delivered and smell less like corn syrup . taste is quite zesty and sweet again . flavours of lemon and lime as you imagine them in candy form . does take a slightly sour turn towards the mid - more like actual citrus flavour , but this is sadly overtaken by a bit of a yeasty character , slightly doughy and a bit stale . finish is very dry , with a slight vinous character like a ros or similarly sugar-coated faux-wine travesty . feel does have a nice sharp tingle from the bubbles , makes it refreshing but also adds to the soft drink effect of this . as it goes , it 's probably one of the better radler beers , but that 's like saying you 're one of the gentler nazis . would i be so proud and protective of this brew that i 'd try and trademark the word `` radler '' ? of course not . i mean , seriously , get over yourselves , db ."

S'in the glass this is a heavily chill hazed amber colored beer with a strong reddish tinge to it . this beer never entirely clears ; it is that whole organic thing i guess . the head is small and off-white to light tan in color until is disappears . the scent is sweet and very malty with a strong aroma of rye to it . this is a little spicy and there is a bit of brandy scent to it . for a barley wine this is quite grainy smelling . the taste begins sweet and fruity with the flavor of rye and a decent bitterness in the aftertaste . the taste stays on the mild and fruity side and this is quite deceptive about how strong it is . the fruit flavor is the indistinct fruity sensation that you get from juicy fruit gum ; fruity without an exact fruit you can compare it too . not an outstandingly hoppy beer this is more a malty one , that or hops have whacked my perception to the point that stone ruination is a mild pale ale . the mouthfeel is ok but a little thin for the style . this is outstanding in drinkability , for what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in just being plain easy to drink . this is pretty deceptive in its mild taste and lack of alcohol burn ; it drinks like malty pale ale and kicks like a rodeo bull . three of these and it is goodnight for you .'

S"12 oz . bottle poured into a shaker , bronze with a large-bubbled off-white head that leaves light lace and quickly dissapates . smell is sour and grainy , like a wheat beer almost , with a hint of sugar . taste is just off , something about this one from the first sip was too much , like spiced cereal . semi-sweet with a cloying , medicinal aftertaste that really lingers , yuk ... have to dump this one ! mf is average . drinkability is low , i did n't finish this one because it just did n't work for me and life 's too short . do n't think it was spoiled or anything , just a gross taste from whatever malt/esters/hop combo they picked . would n't want to power though and chug this one either , insta-puke !"

S"botle nothced as brewed in november or december . a- this beer has a nice head that lasts and a great dark amber colour , but was ruined by having large chunks of sediment floating in it , even before i pour in the bottom of the bottle . even bottle conditioned beers do n't have this kind of muck floating in them . s- slight burnt caramel . a bit dusty from carbonation . t- weak flavour . hops , dust . some malt and caramel flabourn that intensify as the beer warms . however alcohol taste starts to show too much as it warms . mf- not too watery but nothing special . average all the way . d- something a bit off , does n't make me want to have any more after i am 3/4 of the way through the beer . it catches in my throat . i suspect the bottle is getting a bit old ."

S'tried this on cask yesterday for the first time . pour is orangey amber with a small head . nice soft rings of lace remain on the glass as i consume it . smell is quite mild but there are some decent hop aromas wafting from the glass . the taste is balanced with some malt presence to make this baby one smooth as hell ipa . the cask conditioning really seems to help this . it is exceptionally drinkable . seems like it would be fairly versatile for food pairing too . a very decent offering . i should mention that the cask at rb is still pretty chilly . much colder than a cask beer in england for example .'

S"i think this is now called harpers ale . more than once , i heard harpers light described as bud light by a server , which i 'm sure the brewer did n't appreciate . i ordered it up thinking it was a new brew . the beer is quite clear , likely filtered . pretty refreshing and serves well as a session beer . certainly will appeal to the masses who enjoy the light lagers . it 's not harper 's most interesting beer , but it does what it itends to do . light beers of course are the hardest to make well , and this beer does a decent job hitting the mark ."

S"appearance : thin straw colored with a fizzy small head , one guy put it well by saying it looked like ginger ale , though i think it 's lighter smell/taste : imagine you drink a budweiser then you fill the glass with water , that 's exactly what bud select is mouthfeel : it 's water drinkability : the one remotely decent thing about this beer is that it is refreshing , but that 's only because there is 0 flavor . this beer is shockingly bad , i mean there are two reasons to drink beer , for the taste or for the buzz , this beer fails miserably in both . it 's 2.4 % abv , that would take like 15 beers for me to even feel a buzz , my kidneys would probably burst by then , the only purpose for this beer is for annorexic girls who would get drunk off my breath ."

S"pours a hazy gold/straw color with a small head . the smell is alright . you have some fruit upfront and a nice wild funk from the brett . the part that knocks it down for me is something that reminds me of colgate toothpaste in the background . for a sour , wild beer this is n't very tart ( though i think that might be what mikkeller was going for based on the abv ) . it has a nice barn backdrop with a touch of bitter at the end . the mouth is very light . i 'm not sure i agree with placing this in the bpa catagory , it does fit to a certain extent , but it contains quite a bit more funk than other beers in this style . funk is good , but even for a funky beer this does n't rate very high on my drinkability scale . sorry mikkeller , this one was a miss for me ."

S"review from beeradvocate magazine vol . ii issue ix : apparently , this is the first ever organic pumpkin beer , using organic pumpkins grown at golden russett farm in shoreham , vt. , owned by will and judy stevens . pours a cloudy burnt-orange color with a crowning , slightly off-white head that settles to a nice , creamy lace with some stick . aroma is soft with a dominating allspice that 's intoxicating and full of holiday memories . creamy mouthfeel ; fairly light-bodied , crisp around the edges with a dry foundation . nice semi-bitter sour notes from the spicing and hops provide a quick snap . hint of pumpkin starch with a thin layer of maltiness . a dusting of clove , cinnamon and nutmeg with a slight gingery bite -- your typical pumpkin pie spices . touch of vegetable squash as things warm with an emerging herbal character . finish is quite dry and dusty , and the spices stay embedded in the palate for a while . the spices are n't overwhelming and the dryness makes for a drinkable brew ; however , we like a bit more meat in our pumpkin ales . and , by that , we mean we 'd like more of the pumpkin flavor pulling through -- this is a pumpkin beer , after all -- along with a bit more of malty backbone to provide some more depth , character and balancing sweetness ."

S'id like to thank splitgrin for sending me this interesting beer . pours very dark , very thick and with little to no foam , no matter how high i poured the bottle from to try and create some . the aroma is just like a well crafted ris should smell like : roasted and chocolate malts , coffee and vanilla notes , very clean and intense . time to taste this bad boy . its a deceptive beer ill say . deceptive in the way that it shows hardly any carbonation and yet once you take a sip of this your mouth tingles from it . its a big beer . the coffee is intense and also the chocolate and roasted malts , but the only drawback is that the alcohol is noticeable enough to worry me if ill be able to finish this bomber while im getting sleepy . as the beer warms up the alcohol seems to overpower in the aroma . the mouthfeel is rich and velvety only a bit too much carbonation . the more i sip it the more i get the alcohol in the taste and aroma which reminds me more and more of liquor , which i find that hard to tolerate now . the biggest drawback of this beer , for my taste is the strong alcohol presence . this beer is just not for me , but at least i got to try it .'

S"this beer was delivered to goebel liquor in wichita , ks the week i purchased it so although the bottle was n't dated , i assume it was fresh , but not too fresh . poured into a goblet . given a fairly aggressive pour , yielded a tan 3/4 '' dense head sitting on a nearly black beer with mahogany highlights at edges . head faded after a couple of minutes to a thin covering with a fair amount of lacing to begin with , but the lacing did n't live up to its initial promise . aroma of roasted barley and understated earthy ( kg ? ) hops while cool . after it warms up those aromas are still there , but a little raisin and maybe even a little alcohol becomes noticeable . after initial sensation of prickly carbonation , taste begins as crisp malts with subtle yeast character ( not estery , more like the aroma of yeast cake in a homebrew using irish ale yeast and uk hops ) quickly transitioning to roasted barley and finishing with bitter coffee . taste acquires a sweetness in the initial impression after warming up and the roast character at the finish creates a pleastant dusty quality in the sinuses . after looking into the empty bottle it seems this a bottle conditioned ale , which may explain the yeasty taste . acceptable degree of hop bitterness lingers for a good while in the aftertaste . mouthfeel is a bit thin , but in keeping with the style of a dry stout . this would make a good session beer . overall , this is a good dry stout and although it is an understated beer , it is quite enjoyable ."

S'the malheur 12 was really quite an odd beer , with a beautiful dark amber color and a light head . it was a great consistency and a bit heady , but thats common for big bottle belgians . roomate picked it up at the local beer store ( rodmans in dc ) and poured in a tall glass . the smell was very fruity , though the presence of the alcohol ( 12 % abv ) was certainly a turn-on . the taste was incredibly soft and the fruitiness and maltiness hit the palate together almost immediately . its a combination a lot of beers try for ( the delerium nocturnum , to name one ) , but can never quite balance out the way this beer does . the dark fruit , caramel maltiness , and subtleties in lacing make the malheur 12 exceptionally soft in the mouth , but the beer does not round out enough in the end to make it really drinkable in the long run . fantastic beer for a glass , but reluctant to drink continuously .'

S"poured from a corked 25.4 ounce bottle into a 4 ounce wine glass . appearance : light golden yellow , very light carbonation , thin head floating on the surface of the beer . light ring around the edge of foam . the bubbles within float up in about 10 straight lines from the bottom to the top of the wine glass . smell : beautiful floral scent to this beer . the alcohol is well-hidden here , gentle hop tones , peach and or pear accents . really nice , especially for a tripel ! taste : eh . hops and flowers up front followed quickly by the fruitiness i detected in the scent . aftertaste is more bitter than i would have hoped . this beer would go well with red meat and/or starchy foods in my opinion . mouthfeel : quite light on the palate , only a medium-thin coating of malt character . rinses easily . it 's not bad ... unfortunately , that 's about all i can say for certain . drinkability : nearly non-existent . if i had n't paid nearly eight dollars for this bottle , i would probably discard what 's left in the fifth . as it is , looks like i 'm doomed to finish it . the alcohol ( which is hiding in the scent ) is overly powerful in the taste , and it takes away from what could be a very flavorful beer . i bought this beer in a `` cool label '' state of mind tonight , and i probably should have gotten some recommendations instead . there are lots of better examples of monk beer , specifically three philosophers and avery brewing 's `` the reverend .

S"man , o-man . i am glad i do n't live in pa where you have to buy a case or pay $ 10 a six pack at a bar , because i would have returned the unused portions for a refund . i do n't know quite what to say about this beer . it pours an a pale yellow , like a fading sun with little to know head and carbonation that faded faster than champaigne poored into a tub . if there was a head i must have blinked and missed it . the smell screams of adjucts . corn , rice , corn , maybe old vegetables , corn , corn husk , and did i mention corn ? tastes of corn ( imagine that ) , little malt , and some third world hops ( maybe botswana or penang ) . the mouth feel is medium , but fast fading carbonation . taste better than keystone light , but keystone light does n't have much taste . could this be a bad bud clone ? please sir , no more ."

S'i got this one off of a trade from a friend of mine . it pours a real dark thick black with a very nice creamy head that lasted all the way to the end of the glass with some pretty decent lacing , im guessing this is from the nitro can . the smell did not impress me too much , maybe some coffee , a little roastiness , and maybe a little chocolate malt . the taste was roasted malts and coffee with a little bit of a watery taste . it finished out real creamy and has that creamy finish most nitrogen conditioned stouts have . this beer is by all means nothing too special , reminds me of a upgraded guiness . but its pretty cheap and i was actually quite surprised , i had some low expectations for this beer but it turned out alright .'

S"bottle sent back to mt by homeboy gd . thanks greg . best by 1-19-11 . light brown/amber shade with a big fluffy white head . good retention and a good looking beer overall . hops are still pretty fresh - light pine and floral with a little cat pee . malt is very restrained and allows the hops to give maximum effect . as expected , hops are showcased - bright , delicate floral hops , with a slight tropical fruit flavor and a bit of pine bitterness . again , malt contribution is very light - i 'd guess crystal or pale with a touch of caramel . medium bodied with a slight oilyness . feel is smooth with full carbonation . good , but does n't quite hit the creamy feeling that surly 's fresh hop wet delivers . enjoyed this as a light and refined fresh hop ale . not quite as good as surly or great divide in my opinion , but one of the best ."

'' `` well , be certain to wear your cream-colored caps and cloudy-day orange knickers ! '' `` we will , mother !

S"poured into a 21 oz pilsener glass at the local neighborhood hole-in-the-wall . appearance : it was dark in the bar but it was clearly not a bud or miller lager . it had a light brown color that started with a fairly thick head that disappeared when i sipped it . for a bock the nut brown was surprisingly light colored . smell : there was some faint sweetness , especially when the head was present . still for a bock it seemed rather subdued . taste : it was noticeably fuller and more sweet than most lager you would find in a whole-in-the-wall . the taste was above average and while i have had bocks which were better i have also had quite a few other beers that were not as flavorful . mouthfeel : indistinguishable from budweiser , not much thicker than water . drinkability : went down easy enough and not to strong . basically it could be drank all night for cheap . one of a & b 's better brews as far as i 'm concerned . bock is a strong word to describe this beer as it is watered down in terms of sight , smell , taste and texture that one usually associates with bock . with all this said i enjoyed this much more than the american adjunct lager usually released by the big name breweries . this is a great back-up beer to sip if you are at a bar with limited selection ."

S"says 7 % abv right on the 750ml bottle . a- black and thick just like an american stout with a really nice puffy , soft looking tan head . huge thick gobs of lace stick everywhere and it seems the foam will never go away . when it shrinks down some it becomes dense and creamy like a frothy cappuccino . s- alot of chocolate and very warm in the nose . vanilla bean , mild coffee and dark fruits as well . raisins , date , fig , some smoky incense sandalwood type aromas and pipe tobacco . floral alcohol esters of quality french vodka and plenty of roasted malt , charred wood , whiskey , soil , and chocolate mousse . seems a little less harsh than a russian imperial stout with a softer creaminess to the aroma , no doubt from the inclusion of belgian chocolate . however , the nose is n't really any more chocolatey than other fine stouts . slight hop presence is earthy and herbal but gets lots amid the roasted and cocoa complexities . only very mild yeast , the existence of which could possibly be an illusion . t- now this is chocolate . from start to finish , dark belgian chocolate is melting in my mouth , somewhere similar to 70 % cacao . dark roast coffee as well with an intense roasted bitterness . woodsy , cigar , tobacco , brandy , thick resinous dark fruits , molasses , even faint notes of shiraz wine , blackberry and pepper . charred wood , charcoal , earthy hops , and even more chocolate . soil , compost , and darkness . cocoa sweetens out near the finish and takes on a milk chocolate character and the roasted malt fades . pleasant savory char lingers on the palate with some tartness and strong brewed mocha . lasting bitter somewhat herbal aftertaste . mf- rich and smooth , borderline luscious , with a coating chocolate feel and resinous qualities about it . medium low carbonation , right where it needs to be . d- though brewed in the belgian style , i have to review this as a stout because it shares almost no similarities with any bsda i 've ever had . its a stout , i do n't care , it says it on the bottle and it sure as hell looks smells and tastes like one . and its a gooood one . chocolate flavor can get pretty intense after on glass ."

S'his lager should be appreciated for what it is ... a clean , crisp , refreshing , brew that appeals to the masses and can be drank whenever and wherever . there are many other much better lagers and ales that appeal to those of us with discerning tastes and appreciation for really good beer . but after a day of construction work in the sweltering summer heat , nothing beats an ice cold budweiser . just as during the shortest and coldest of days in winter sitting in my favorite pub , a pint of stout , porter or doppel bock is just what the doctor ordered .'

S'i have been eying this beer for several years and finally decided to pursue one . first off , let me say that i love bourbon barrel aged beers , but lets face it , isnt 36 months ridiculously long ? the aroma has some enjoyable elements ( a hint of caramel and chocolate , vanilla and oak . ) but there muted by the strong presence of raw whiskey and booze . i dont find the nose particularly nice at all . next , this tastes more like bourbon or tawny port than it does beer . it would taste more like beer if the body wasnt completely flat and lacking texture . it does have a few intriguing hints of vanilla and sweet oak on the finish , but the flavor up until then is absolutely ghastly . way too boozey , one dimensional with bourbon . i , unfortunately , can not finish this beer .'

S"batch 004 - 5.65 % abv a - a fine-looking brew in a tulip . a frothy , rocky white head sits atop a fairly carbonated , clear , golden body . bubbles rise up to the surface at a rather slow rate of speed , but there sure is a lot of them . lacing . s - lighter fruits , green apples , yeasty esters . slight spiciness . nothing remarkable , but smells wonderful nonetheless . t - rather sweet , but not cloying . yeast is prevelant , and it has the tendency to transform a bit in your mouth . it seems all the spots are hit with this ... sweet , sour , dry , bitter ... all without becoming a jumbled mess . for a lighter brew , this really does n't hold back . could it stand to be less muted ? sure ... but then we 'd be getting into bspa categories . for what it is , it 's a damned fine brew . m - light and crisp , with a slightly coating finish . d - this could be cloying on a bad day , i 'm sure . right now , i 'm chillin out , just got off work , enjoyin this mild 73 degree day . ca n't think of many other brews i 'd pick over this right now . notes : got this from largadeer in my second trade and finally delved into it . my first rr turned out to be a tasty example of their craftsmanship . if anything , i 'm even more stoked to try the other offerings in my cellar . shit , my mom liked this ."

S"aroma is a light amber with a big head from a fully high pour that is bubbly rather than creamy . looks appealing . aroma is faint , sweet malts , certainly an ale , nothing offensive but nothing groundbreaking . certainly nothing was added ( dry hop ) to make this beer have a notable aroma , but that 's cool in and of itself ... flavors are mellow like the aroma , mild both in malt and hop flavor . it 's not too sweet like say , bass , which is good , so the hops , while gentle for an american beer , are still noticeable . this beer is bland cold , but when it warmed it revealed an interesting toastiness to compliment the gentle hops . the flavor was too weak when cold , and enjoyable but just shy of flavorful once warmed . very approachable beer . mf is light , not watery on the tongue , but far from even medium bodied . do n't know much about altbiers , but as an amber ale it 's very drinkable , but i probably wont stock it unless its for other people in hopes i can find better , though it 's rather good . must not drink it ice cold for the full experience . it 's thirst quenching , conversational , and well balanced , so not for those craving an extreme beer ."

S"served on tap at the rehoboth beach pub , sampler size glass at the recommendation of mdaschaf , thecpj and the waitress . ut oh , this must not be that good , i 'm adventurous and still wanted to sample this one . a : black , pitch dark body with essentially a non-existent head , naturally due to being a smaller serving . a bit of off-white foam circled the glass but nothing impressive . s : a strange and eclectic blend of fruit and fresh mint . fruity puree and peppermint are immediately evident . what this beer fails to present is any qualities of an american stout . the malt base here is extremely weak for the style and really does n't help tie any of these loose ends together . t : i 'll describe the flavors but this is honestly terrible . infected , lactic and sour berries ( raspberries ? ) blended with a milky , minty flavor that turns into the most unappealing flavor i 've sampled in a beer to my recollection . this is horrible - an experiment or cover-up gone terribly wrong . m : surprisingly has a relatively full body on it , but to call it full-bodied would be misleading . slight carbonation to it but still creamy . i really have no clue what dogfish head is trying to pull here . this is the worst beer i 've ever sampled from them . as someone else put it , it tastes like infected fort drenched with mint to cover up how horrible it is . in reality , they seem to have created a beast no one should ever try to conquer . holy shit , this was gross . end of story ."

S"bottle poured into pint glass appearance : dark amber with no lacing/head . smell : light amber malt scent . nothing to call home about . taste : off citrus flavor that kills some of the other flavors ... malt seems empty , i think it was made from malt extract . overall , just kind of a sad beer . drinkability : not something i 'll search out in the future . i 'm glad i got this free from a friend . if i 'd bought a sixer of this i 'd have to toss it or give it to some homeless guy ."

S"i was going to store all of these but the call to drink was too much ... chunky , medium brown `` swamp '' color ... .head is small-bubbled but persistent . yeasty fresh smell , a hint of powerful smoke . very full-bodied , nice and hugely sweet taste with a spicy almost nutmeg/cidery property , lots of smoked meat . huge mouth coating properties . tobacco smoke flavor mostly at the back and in the aftertaste . there is a kind of springtime freshly tilled soil taste but its not at all off putting -- well it is in a way , but its interesting to taste that old wet canvas of summertime tents in the days before nylon . the complexity of this beer is not so obvious as rich , like the smell of mown grass . honey and fireplace ashes sums it up . its also slightly more drinkable than i expected but pretty heavy duty . one is enough at a sitting for me . as the meaty sweet aroma comes on , and you look at the floating murky yeast , do n't think about this beer in any classic categories too much . skoal on this one , it might even make a good steak sauce on its own !"

S"served in a pint glass . a : no clue what color the head was since it had completely dissipated in transit from the tap to my seat . the body is orangey copper and perfectly clear . s : the nose is weak . pale bready malts are present and it is n't that they are strong , it 's just that they 're stronger than the hops ( which are basically mia ) . slightest hint of caramel malts . this is one of the weakest , least impressive pale ales i 've ever had . i 'm doubtful that the pursuit of pale ale even deserves the stylistic designation , which , as i think about it , is one of the most ironic name choices i 've ever come across ... t : i 've had more flavorful sub-par pilsners . m : semi fizzy carbonation and probably the right amount of bubbles , but given the lack of flavor , the carbonation seems way out of scale , basically rendering the beer untasteable . d : unimpressive drinkability . i would have finished my pint but all i really wanted to do was enjoy a good brew after work before i headed home . i asked the bartender to take my half-full beer ( yes , i can be optimistic ) so i could accomplish my original goal . i am fairly certain that this beer was n't served as the brewer intended as i 've come to regard victory as one of pa 's finer breweries ."

S'i did not loke this beer , it simply tasted awful . the beer looked nice as it poured into the glass with a nice amber color and a huge frothy head . the aromas were ok , with a nice balance of malt , ginger and lemony hops . the taste , however , was repulsive ; the raw ginger flavor overpowered all other components of the beer . like chewing crystalized ginger from the spice rack . i was hoping for a ginger bread , or ginger snap flavor underlying a nice ale , but got a mouthful of yechy ginger !'

S'16 oz sharp looking can split with rhinos00 and poured into a sam adams glass . a- straw colored with some haze , the can says the beer is unfiltered , so no big deal there . white head quickly dissipates leaving a thin film that stays for duration . very little lacing , but where present : spotted . very high carbonation probably caused by the etching . s- when cold , this is a subtle beer . dominated by the sweetness of the pilsner malt base , with a buttery background and very little hop character , if any at all . as the beer warms , a swirl and deep inhale reveal a tingle from carbonation and a pleasant spicy-floral hop aroma . t- very clean on the palate to start . the same malt sweetness is dominant like it was in the nose . after the palate has time to react , floral , earthy , and spicy hops character that is very subtle , but detectable . the beer wraps up with a slight tang and then hop bitterness , just shy of a pilsner . m- smooth and silky for a light colored lager . thicker than expected . the carbonation in the appearance is deceiving . d- if i lived near surly , i would have a bunch of these in my refrigerator from april until september . highly drinkable beer . i feel bad i only drank one . edit : after reading up on keller bier , a style i admittedly new very little about before drinking this beer , i raised the appearance from 3.0 to 3.5 . this beer is traditionally cloudy .'

S'black and opaque in color with a tan colored head that remains thick for just a few seconds before dissipating and leaving little splotches of lacing . aromas of alcohol , fresh vanilla , cream , and roasted sugar . the vanilla , particularly , was very enticing and unique . the taste is soft and sweet with a smoked/roasted flavor upfront and a swift vanilla flavoring to follow . a medium-dry finish with a lingering sweet & smooth aftertaste that can be a bit overpowering . not a whole lot of complexity , but still the flavors that are present work well together and create a unique stout . the drinkability takes a hit because the vanilla flavoring , though unique and enjoyable , becomes too sweet and leaves a sticky film on my tongue .'

S"pours a lovely golden amber with a small fizzy beige head that is incredibly short lived and leaves no lacing behind . basically it looks like a delicious glass of cider . juicy red apple jumps out at the nose , along with cinnamon and nutmeg . there is some honey sweetness and a floral quality as well . a really amazing smelling brew . unfortunately , the nose does n't carry over into the taste . i get some red apple skin , but none of the luscious juiciness the nose promised . there is a bit of caramel maltiness and the spices are still there but not very prominent . while the immediate flavors are just bland , the aftertaste is off-putting . the finish is bitterly medicinal and sour , and sticks around far too long . the body is surprisingly light based on the juicy nose and 7.7 % abv . the finish is quite dry and really brings out the bitterness , which is surprising since it is under 20 ibus . i had high hopes for the last 1/3 of the bottle , after struggling through it cold i was hoping that heating the beer as the label suggested would make it shine.. my hopes were dashed , the apple flavor , which is n't prominent enough cold fades even more when heated and the unpleasant medicinal aftertaste really shines . the wonderful nose was muted by the heat as well . a few sips and then i dumped it . if i were to rate this hot it would lose at least a full letter grade . this beer had so much promise ; the concept , appearance , and aromas were all quite enticing , but as soon as it hit my tongue everything went downhill ."

S"*1999 vintage* as per the ba database picture . 1999 vintage , corked . cost me $ 5.99 for the 11.2 ounce bottle . thankfully , the cork was in excellent condition & had preserved this beer well , which is not always the case i hear . solid black mass , a semblance of deep brown bubbles formed when poured , not really a head , more like a washing up liquid froth . these bubbles soon burst to leave just a very thin brown halo ring that clings to the edges of the glass . this beer has no head whatsoever , which is no surprise at all , in fact it is to be expected for the style . anyone who has ever had a courage imperial russian stout , especially those of 10+ years old , will be very familiar with the appearance of this beer they are incredibly similar . each top-up quickly releases carbonation & forms a short lived brown head . slightly vinous at first , but nothing to be concerned about , especially when the dark fruits , figs , molasses , dark treacle syrup & plums even , break through . what an incredible nose . the way the dark fruits , the flanders red sourness & a rich deeply exotic luxurious powerful dark stout kick are all wrapped up with a semblance of aged oak wooden casks soaked in port is quite incredible . i must spill some of this my pillow to remind how good it was when i wake up tomorrow . a very strong port like entrance , rich & voluptuous it warms the inner mouth a little as it smoothly coats the cheeks & tongue with raisins & other dark fruits , like cashmere on the naked body of a supermodel , it feels good . imperial & imperious with a stunning complexity . huge mouthfeel , just fucking huge . so big , its the galaxy c-5 of the beer world . youre never going to take a 6-pack of this to your neighbors bbq , but i found it to drink relatively easily , mainly due to the fact that the alcohol is well controlled & your concentration on the recognition of all the complex tastes distract you from the mere act of imbibing . even though the 11.2 fl.oz were sipped , it soon disappeared . i must get some more ! ! enjoyable . whilst this is a very good attempt at recreating an imperial extra double stout , it lacks the fine refinement of say a courage imperial russian stout twice its age . aging may well improve this one a little bit ; i would certainly risk aging this '99 sample further . like an old dialect of a modern day foreign language , many people may not understand , recognize or even appreciate this quite marvelous complex beer style but this really is what an imperial stout should be"

S'pissy yellow and no head whatsoever . served close to freezing temperature . very light probably the lightest beer ive had in a long while . slight aroma of rice or corn or whatever , hard to tell . no malt or hop presence . i think what i have here in front of me is yellow sea water . the only thing that im really detecting is a saltiness . goes down easy because its so light ( and cold ) . weak in character , weak in substance , overall weak . i can just imagine ben franklin or one of our countrys forefathers walking into a pub , asking for an ale and getting served one of these . heresy ! i cant wait to try michelob ultra !'

S"got this recommended from my local beer & wine place , not bad . slightly cloudy dark leather color with a weak head . only prominent smells i could detect were strong hops and a slight malt . flavor was very good , bitter hops all over the place but still could taste the malt and sweetness . mouthfeel was slightly cloying but it works here . i 'd say it 's fairly drinkable , but it leaves a lingering bitterness that never leaves your tongue . i 'd say this is nice with buffalo wings or something else that will counteract the sloppy hops . overall a good beer , but not sure why it 's labeled an `` old ale .

S"poured into a glass in the `` lab '' from a bomber . appearance : a smoothe orange tan , much like a dark ice tea . tiny , tiny bubbles dancing up inside , but overall tne body looks asleep . a soapy lather of white head slowly rose upon pouring , but quickly died down with minimal lacing . the beer looks quiet , if that makes sense . minutes after pouring and it looks like it has been sitting out for awhile . not too impressed . smell : just a hint of wheat , and a small amount of figgy sweetness . a very small amount . at first i wasnt getting much at all , so i let it sit for a few minutes . i even cleansed the snout with a whiff of coffee beans hoping i would pick up more . alas , there is n't a huge amount going on with the aroma . as i said , i 'm just getting a really feint fruit sweetness . perhaps a whisper of maple ? might just be wishful sniffing . i was hoping for waffles . taste : pretty refreshing . it reminds me of mildly sweet breakfast cereal , leaving a lingering taste of cheerios , with a ( very , very ) small amount of maple syrup drizzled on it . definetly can taste the wheatiness on the finish . rolling it back over the tongue , the sweetness from the maple says hello very quickly on the tip , but gets bulldogged by the big dull chubby sour wheats on the sides . like i said , the after taste is definetly the cereals , but it is light and not unpleasant . ps- aha , i found the maple . let the beer hit the middle of your tongue first , not the tip . thats where the maple lies . moutful : average bodied , definetly not flabby but no where near light either . i feel it is very indicative of it 's head , medium sized foamy bubbles make for a transition from firm to frothy . their is little alcohol burn , and the carbonation is not abrasive . it leaves the mouth slightly prickled , and a tad dry . drinkability : very drinkable . i could do a bunch of these . i think it comes from the fact that it is not overly extreme in any category . the added maple hints are built upon what alone would be a refreshing wheat . the beer is refreshing enough to go with a salty meal , perhaps ham ."

S"this beer is a perfect college/frat party beer . it can get you drunk within six to eight beers . and wo n't really give much of a hangover the next night . the appearance is lightly gold yellow soda . the foam dissolves just like soda . it looks like a watered down mountain dew . the taste is ... well carbonated water , and a cornmeal , green apple hint to it . tastes somewhat metallic and there is n't really much hops at all . ( tonic water taste way more bitter than keystone light ) mouthfeel = soda its drinkability is good depending on what you 're drinking for . if your looking to shotgun and go all out on beer at a party than this is perfect , it has no extreme flavors . but if you 're looking to drink as an actual drink you might as well drink club soda ."

S'i am reviewing this from the nitro can this time . the appearance is a jet black solid with brown edging . in the beginning the carbonation rises and rises , not as much as in a bottle though , and it finally settles in the form of a tan pancake on top of the beer . the smell has faint hints of mocha ringing through and not much else . a little disapointing . the taste is very much like the bottle . roasted , creamy , hints of chocolate and toffee , and rounded out with black coffe bitterness . always let it warm up a bit just to let you know . the mouthfeel is still light , but not as light , like the bottled version . the drinkability is better than ever ! chug , chug , chug ! , or great as a session beer . not bad but i still prefer the nitro-bottled version .'

S'found this louisiana beer and wanted to try what the people who drink more alcohol than the germans had locally . it poured very nicely and had a substantial amount of head and very nice lace . the only comment about this beer is that it had a bit of an aftertaste that sugested that it was brewed using non-filtered water . very good local beer and good price. ! !'

S"brown dumpy 33cl bottle , obtained from biershop de bierboom in brugge . this is a blonde beer with truffles added , this small farm brewery do weird stuff with their beers . the famous french black truffles are found in the same aera as this beer is brewed . poured into a westmalle chalice with as much of the sediment as possible remaining in the bottle . the beer was a thin , pale yellow with no head at all , reminded me of a scrumpy cider in looks . there is also a very slight haze in the body , plenty of carbonisation , clearly see bubbles rising through the beer . female pigs are used to find truffles , they grow just below the surface and are found by smell . the smell given off is akin to the aroma a male pig gives off when after a mate . the smell of this beer was n't of pig sweat , but it was n't far off . a biliousness , disgustingly sweet vinagerous smell hits the nose , my vocabulary is n't large enough to put the stench into words , sorry . i was looking forward to this beer , i have another one from the brewery , with hazlenuts added i think , not looking forward to that so much now ! the taste is weird too , a sweet sourness and nasty farmyard/horse/manure/fertilizer/pig taste produce something quiet unique in the beer world . sadly it is an experience i would n't want too try again ."

S"12oz bottle into duvel tulip . 22 05 2028 l8143 13:41:00 printed on the bottle . i 'm assuming this means it was either bottled or put in oak barrels at 1:41pm on may 22nd of either 2010 or 2008 , respectively , but i do n't really know ( care ) . appearance : despite zero gushing when opening the bottle , this rather carbonated beer leaves a three inch fizzy and rocky just-offwhite head that dissipates steadily , leaving ephemeral , bubbly lacing webs . pours a hazy orange and leaves occasional swoops of lacing along the glass . looks really good . smell : effervescent and sour . more barnyard than tang/cologne to this brett funk . while i remain unfamiliar with the smell of horse blanket , if `` horse blanket '' in beer means something like leather and horse sweat , this one 's leaning on the side of sweat , with some dirt thrown in . i 'm not finding that aspect pleasant , but there 's also some really interesting mineral smells , some vague citrus , emerging cologne-like notes , and a general sourness that 's really nice . great balance to the aroma , despite venturing further in the barnyard than i wanted to go . taste : first impression : this is not very tart or sour , though there 's some nice , reasonably deep , earthy funk . i think i need to warm it up a bit . as the beer warms , the dirt from the nose emerges in the beer , along with a mild , unexpected bitterness . too much barnyard , not enough tang . no sweetness at all , and barely any sourness or tartness . finishes extremely dry . uninspired by this beer , i try some cheddar and crackers to maybe combat some of the assault , but the beer remains bitter and predominantly characterless . there 's occasional good elements , but never do i get one really good sip ; for example , late in the glass this really nice note of pear jumps out , but is then quickly eaten up by building bitterness and abrasive dryness . it 's not terrible , but it 's not good either . mouthfeel : the 3.5 i 'm awarding here is basically a 4.0 for creaminess and nice , bright carbonation , along with a 2.0 for the uncomfortably dry finish and out of control astringency . slightly lighter than medium bodied . drinkability : to be frank , i do n't like this beer at all . i finished the bottle , but i did n't particularly want to . unless the bottles vary widely and are occasionally amazing , i see no reason to ever buy this when you can get better geuezes or other wild ales for comparable or lower prices . it really was a mess . the lack of sourness or tartness really highlighted"

S'poured from 12oz bottle at cellar temp into pint glass . pours a dark maghony with some ruby accents . nice creamy looking tan colored head that had some pretty decent retention . a little bit of lacing as well . the smell is of very sweet malts , fruity , with a little bit of alcohol the taste is very sweet and tart . lots of sweet maltiness , a sour like fruitiness . finishs dry with a bitter tart lingering aftertaste . there is a little bit of hoppiness to it as well , something if never really found in a bock beer . dry mouthfeel , medium carbonation , medium to full body . alcohol is not very noticable but perhaps a little to sweet to enjoy many of these . im not a huge fan of the bock style , but this one was much better than i expected it to be . i would recommend it if your looking for a nice american rendition of the style .'

S'i found this beer to be extremely drinkable , but pretty bland otherwise for a scottish ale . the growler i had was about a week old , but had been refrigerated the entire time before opening . this beer pours a light amber color with a thin white head that quickly faded into my pint glass . the smell was malty and sweet . the taste was mild without too much carbonation , and finished with a lot of sweetness that faded rather quickly with very little aftertaste at all . this is a beer you could easily drink all night and is great for a group who may not like more full-flavored ales .'

S'appearance : pours a clear amber with a thick head which dissipates to a small ring which clings to the glass . a gentle stream of small bubbles rising to the surface . smell : a very distinctive vanilla and toffee smell , less so than i remember with original innis & gunn but definitely there . taste : very interesting - the sweet vanilla/toffee taste comes through initially but gives way to a light hoppy bitterness at the back of the mouth . feels balanced . mouthfeel : medium carbonation , about right for this style . drinkability : a very easy drinking beer , although one to be savoured - perhaps only in a small quantity of 1 or 2 in an evening .'

S"14.9 floz nitro can into guinness tulip pint glass ( brand new ! ! ! ) a - my god is that satisfying to watch ! big nitro cascading that slowly evens out to reveal a dark brown body , with a creamy tan head . the beer is not as dark as other , so there is a good amount of light getting in at the bottom of the glass . the head , of course , retains notoriously well and leaves plentiful amounts of lacing . s - not a bad nose ; at least there is enough of one to smell . the majority of the nose is the malts , sweet and roasted . some caramel-esque notes . on the whole the nose is fairly one-dimensional ; it just kind of screams : `` hey , hey buddy ... malts ! '' t - initial taste is exactly like a coffee soda that has been diluted and left out to de-carbonate . the finish has some of the taste open up , mainly because it finally gets to the bitter flavour receivers at the back of the tongue . as can be guessed the flavour is predominantly bitter , with some suggestion of sweetness every now and then . after taste is an extension of the finish , but fades quickly leaving a faint coffee-like bitterness , though no means as acidic . mf & d - the feel is deplorable : no depth whatsoever , watery , faintly carbonated , and boring . i would n't say it is awful , since it is potable , but its a little worse than just 'not being impressed ' , so i go with the 1.5. this pathetic body does let one have supreme chugging powers , but only until the blandness catches up with you and you query `` why the hell am i drinking this ?

S"my second apwa review in two days . hot damn . poured from the bottle into a pint glass -- thanks to kels for introducing me to this one . appearance : pours a slightly hazy light , wheaty golden color with a small , just under one finger head that is white and and uneven -- parts are thick and look a little bit like wet cotton balls floating on top ; dwindles very quickly to a very thin skim on top . very solid carbonation bubbling up from below ; moderately thin lacing that is a little oily tries to hold on to the sides and becomes a little spotty . smell : quite a bit coming out of the nose - i smell some grainy wheat coming out , some slight but sweet malts , some nice citrus ( lemon , i would say , possibly some orange peel in there as well as it 's a little on the sweet side too ) . taste : immediately i 'm hit by two predominant flavors - the grainy wheat-like aspect and the solid lemony citrus . after the initial taste starts to fade though , the wheat is easily the strongest in the aftertaste . mouthfeel : body is very light ; and due to the strong carbonation , it is a crisp and refreshing beer that is really perfect for the summer . there is just a very slight coating left on the tongue and beyond that it is a very clean finish . drinkability : with the warmer weather starting to beat down on us , this is really a great beer that is light in body and low in abv , so it 's very easy to drink without much worry in getting too intoxicated , always ( well , maybe not always ) a plus ."

S"2004-2005 vintage . purchased from a well-lit convenience store , where it may well have resided for almost an entire year , ( yikes ! never again ... ) . medium amber body with 2 solid fingers of thick white head . skunk nose , it 's a damn shame too . i would exempt this portion of the review , but it 's just too common with sam smith 's brews . guys , please , lose the clear bottles ! it ruins too much potentially great beer . good biscuity malt flavor up front . a solid entry as usual from sam smith 's . mild english hops in the finish . slight caramel/toffee flavors also . a solid drinking ale . mouthfeel is generally medium , a little watery , maybe , but fine for what it is . drinkability is actually really high . even with the skunk , which dissapated quickly and did not ruin the experience for me at all , ( beyond the nose rating ) . it is just too bad that all of sam smith 's brews cost so much here in the us . i would love to have the opportunity to session much of their lineup , but ca n't afford it . also , would it kill you guys to ship some casks over here ? overall , after all the bitching ; nothing but love , sam smith 's rules !"

S"one of the best beers in the world , guinness is one of the most consistent beers you 'll find . some beers seem to fall victim to bad batches now and again , but not this stuff . the mouth feel is like no other beer in the world . creamy , thick , and smooth . the appearance is phenomenal . no beer looks better in a glass . guinness is a stout , so the aroma will have the burnt smell that a stout should have . it 's not overpowering though , and does n't have the smoky scent that some stouts do . clever marketing has pushed this beer to `` superstar '' status , but i do n't really think this beer is overrated . this is simply a damn good product , and it 's tough not to like a great product . i personally feel that the nitro cans are better than the draught we get in the u.s. , but you ca n't go wrong either way . the bottles , in my opinion , are poor ."

S"picked up six of these at a local grocery store one evening because it was one of the better brands they carried . german lagers are generally a step or two above most macro american brews imo . anyway , i suffered through the first 5 straight from the bottle over a period of about 2 months . the last one , i decided to pour in a mug so i could hopefully enjoy it a little more . it did n't help . the look was decent . it had a modest head and was clear brown in color . smell and taste were uninspiring . very vague and lacking . not much in the way of sweet . more grainy than anything . drinking this reminded me of taking metamucil . the closer you get to the bottom of the glass , the harder it became to drink . yuck !"

S"last night , at the white birch promo at the legendary blind tiger alehouse , nyc , in a tulip glass.. the best way to describe the appearance is a mimosa with no carbonation . same milky/cloudy orange color , less than a finger of white head , which did n't retain or lace very well . do n't get me wrong ... like most beergeeks , i love unfiltered beer , but the obvious over-abundance of suspended yeast in this badboy had me a little skeptical . then the smell ... i tried not to let the visual evaluation taint my nostrils , but in the end , the smell strangely smelled like a mimosa too . lots of apricot , tangerine , and a little bit of coriander spice . the nuances in the taste mirrored the nose , with lots of tangy citrus , most notably tangerine and apricot , with a very subtle spice in the very dry finish . tasted imbalanced , and disjointed . i got none of the standard spice flavors that i have grown accustomed to getting from a good 'tripel ' , even though there was intended to be a barrel-aging flavor influence . the feel was very thin , with a dry finish , and the high degree of tart & tangy left you with a little acidic bite on the tip of your tongue . as for sessioning ... no way . one was enough . then my buddy and i went on to have two more beers ( made by other breweries ) before we called it a night . neither of us had drunk to the point where we were remotely toasty . then i went home , had dinner , and went to bed , but lo and behold , i woke up 3hrs later in cold sweat , shaking , and massively nautious . i barely made it to the bathroom before violently losing my cookies . i just assumed that i had gotten a mild case of food poisoning . but then ... after getting to work late because of the lack of sleep ... i received a phone call from same said drinking buddy , who proceeded to describe the same exact experience that had happened to him in the middle of the night . given the fact that neither of us ( a ) had the same dinner , ( b ) drank the same beers other than this one , and ( c ) were not even buzzed , we deduced that the logical culprit for our pain was this beer , which made sense , given how much suspended yeast was apparent in it , and how off-kilter it had tasted . needless to say , i will not be touching this beer again any time soon ."

S"i am not a hop head so this beer is honestly a bit too much for me . that said , i did really enjoy it but i could hardly call it highly drinkable . one of these just totally wrecked my palate . no more reviewing tonight ; but it was an enjoyable wreckage . i just do n't need another one . well , heres the breakdown : i let this one warm up fro a while before opening to maximize the smoothness . then served it in my snifter glass . appearance : a golden orange color this beer is translucent but not transparent . active carbonation at the beginning but it died mid way through the beer . it had a creamy white head with decent retention and an adequate amount of lacing . the frothy cap did last the duration of the beer . very nice appearance . smell : this beer is very hoppy but it is not cloyingly pine in the smell or taste . i am not a fan of the eating christmas tree pine flavor . not to fear this hop character is more citrusy with a bit of grass than it is pine . the aroma to me was like lemon and grapefruit . very full poignant aroma . good ! taste : again the taste does get a bit green but not overwhelmingly so . it is more of a citrus grapefruit and granny smith apples type of tart . there is a malt backbone that give the beer some more depth but the malt base does get a bit thin approaching the finish the hop character takes over . a lingering tartness makes this a lip-smacking aftertaste . the aftertaste does come back around though to drop off some more sweet . it is evident there was plenty of sugar in this lemonade : ) so to speak . mouthfeel : medium body . mildly carbonated , mostly it was prickly due to the sharp hops the felt like active needles on my tastebuds . drinkability : how can i comment . i did finish one . and it was good , but i sure as hell do n't want another one . it is a double ipa and you hop heads will love it . there is no way you want to drink it all night ( at least not me ) . i am glad to have had one and one is enough , so i 'll give it a 3.0 and hope this explanation makes sense . hope this is helpful . cheers ! -- -- [ edit ] as my hop palate has grown , so has my apreciation for this beer . -- --"

S"presentation : bomber bottle poured into a snifter glass in two parts . this is my first taste of a rock art beer , and this combines two of my favorite styles , pumpkin and stout . appearance : black in color with a two finger medium brown head and good retention . about par for the course for most stouts . aroma : it 's hard to identify one note that is standing out more than the others . there are espresso , bitter pine , and some sweet pumpkin . the spruce tips provide the pine and also sting a little bit . they really mask some of the other aromas , but not the alcohol burn . taste : a nice balance of sweet pumpkin and coffee and chocolate notes from the malt for a second upfront . this part of the beer has some serious promise . then the added element of the spruce tips make an appearance . they add a harsh , astrigent bitterness to the back end and really give anything else . just really heavy pine bitternes with no sweet counter . the spruce makes this unbalanced and harsh most of the time . mouthfeel : surprisingly thin for a double stout . there 's some carbonation here , although its a tad flat . dry finish . drinkability : the abv being noticable in the nose and taste hurts this as well as the overly bitter and almost unpalatable spruce tips . overall , an interesting and different stout , but that does n't mean a good one . the pumpkin is nice in its ridiculously small role , but the spruce tips are where this beer falls flat . this is my first experience with this ingredient in beers and it completely ruined a nicely balanced stout upfront . they were overly bitter and provided nothing to the taste other than really astrigent pine pitch . this beer was a letdown for me ."

S'appearance : brown , almost headless . smell : rubbery water taste : i think i found like half of a chipped peanut that fell out of a batch of ngs squirrel someplace in here . otherwise , there is definitely some water in the front and the finish is nice and watery . mouthfeel : carbonated water drinkability : goes down easier than miller lite . very poundable but with out appeal to warrant mass consumption .'

S"my wife asked me in the grocery store : `` does n't this look like it might be good ? '' i said no , but we bought it anyway . she does n't ask for that much , so what the hell ? pours a pee yellow color with a big noisy , fizzy , soda-like white head that disappears in a flash leaving nothing behind . smells like artificial lime and tastes much the same . weirdly bitter artificial lime rind flavor is about all there is here . a very weak malt presence hanging around somewhere in the back . this stuff does n't qualify as beer in my opinion . tastes very much like zima . intense overcarbonation tries to make up for the rediculously light body . it 's fairly refreshing and not undrinkable , but it ai n't beer . suffice it to say that i would n't recommend this to any beer lover ."

S"deep mahogany glow is gorgeous . off white , bone colored , one finger head . creamy looking at first , then more bubbly as it settles to a thin layer , leaving tons of lacing . this is a great looking beer . smell is hop-dominant for sure , yet more complex than an in a ipa/dipa ; very floral and earthy . apples and sweet raisin maltiness . spicy . spicy , bitter , pine , earthy , woody hops , with a fruity touch ( raisin and faint apple ) and cannabis . the malt character blends in , and is n't immediately noticeable . alcohol is a bit hot when very fresh but begins to mellow in just a few months . this is a big , bitter beer , and delicious if you are ready for it . it bites , but leaves you satisfied . this will mellow out nicely with some age though . a defining american barleywine . i went out and bought more after the first bottle . 2007 vintage ( reviewed aug 2008 ) not much sound when i opened the bottle , but there is still decent carbonation . not much head formation - maybe half to a full finger , dissolving away to nothing in a couple minutes . same color of course , but very opaque and cloudy . aroma is full of dark fruits and still very earthy . hops have dropped off a little bit causing a much sweeter aroma . man the insane hoppiness of the fresh version has started to tame , but there is still plenty to go around . defintely more balanced though . not a whole lot of difference yet , but i can begin to see where the aging process might take this ."

S'clear roasted amber color , head was tan , bubbly , fizzy . nice rich roasted malty smell . noticable cascade hop aromas . tastes are very balanced and right in line for the style , with a strong hop bite toward the end . sweet malty tastes start , then crisp cascade finish . tastes are fine , but thin , overly carbonated makes it a little tough to drink . serious hop/carbonation burps , the tastes are there , just need smooth out the carbonation and add some body .'

S"i received a bottle from a beer of the month club . it had a very dark brown , opaque color to it . average lace . has kind of a cough syrup smell to it . upon tasting it , though , it 's vanilla extract . very unique taste , but the vanilla comes through way too much . the coffee , i do n't know , i only pick up a slight hint of it as an aftertaste . it tastes like an iced mocha or a vanilla milkshake , i guess . very interesting . i could really only drink one , but it 's a decent enough beer ."

S"beer bottle specifically states `` 2004 new year celebration ale '' ... copped a vintage bottle from super saver in edison ... pours a gorgeous caramel-colored , dark-brown , mahogany hue with an incredibly large frothy and foamy head which exhibited incredible staying power ... smell was very rich and thick with strong brown sugars , heavy malts , dehydrated fruits , and candies ... taste strongly complemented the aroma , with dark , brown sugars , figs , prunes , caramel , and sweet sugars ... a very malty brew , and the four years which have elapsed since this sample was brewed has injected a huge dose of complex character and flavor ... slight sediment is visible in the bottom of the bottle ... a very full-bodied , malty brew ... different from many other kiuchi samples i 've tried ... definitely recommended ..."

S'more beer should come in mock clay jug form . looks alright : a large tan head over a medium brown/ruby liquid . gets bonus points for sweet packaging . smells like brown sugar and a sweaty handful of coins . my traditional view of black and tan is bass ( english pale ale ) with guiness ( irish dry stout ) . mississippi mud elects to to combine a continental pilsner with an english porter . the result is an overcarbonated pilsner beating down a wimpy , subpar porter . tastes like sour cola .'

S"pours a deep black colour with a light tan head that lingers as a collar . i can see a ruby-brown tone when held up to direct sunlight . fairly typical porter aroma consisting of malt and syrupy notes . i ca n't really note the coffee much at all . slight smokey or woody tones . this has a surprisingly bubbly mouthfeel for a porter , imparting an uncommon freshness to the taste . the malty , syrupy taste common to porters is very well balanced by the bitterness of the brewed balzac 's coffee added during the brewing process . this bitterness kills that `` thick '' aftertaste usually associated with porters . instead , i was left with hints of cocoa or baker 's chocolate . i originally tried this as part of a seasonal sampler , then found myself buying six packs regularly ."

S"wow . pours a perfectly clear light straw yellow colour with a huge crackling head of white bubbles , that dip in the centre , but stay attached around the edges of the glass forming a thick and convoluted lacing . no visible carbonation , which is odd , but it looks intriguing from the start . oh my goodness . nose is a huge melange of hoppy herbal characters . smells like a good bunch of nelson sauvin , with slightly earth belgian yeast underneath . if i had to pinpoint the exact herbs , i 'd say rosemary and oregano , even though i know it 's more of a scarborough fair mix . actually , i think the parsley comes through somewhat as well . in any case , it 's an insanely fragrant nose , if only because the herbs are in such prominence . wow again on the palate . you know , i really ca n't tell if this is really , really good or really , really bad . the herbs are again in prominence , but they really feel well integrated into the beer . no , there is not a lot of saison funk , but the herbs do add an organic quality which fits well with the base beer and the spicy notes from the saison yeast . it tastes somewhat spicy , fresh and fragrant with herbs , with a lingering , earthy bitterness . it 's absolutely fascinating , and for all that it falls way out of line for a traditional saison , it keeps a saison-like refreshing bitey palate . you know , i 'm going to go with `` really , really good '' . this is what brewing in america is about : reinventing styles , experimenting , screwing around , but still coming up with something refreshing , tasty and drinkable , and something unique , unexpected and fascinating ."

S'bought this beer in the supermarket . poured into a grolsch glass . the beer pours a yellow-straw color , with a nice white head . smell : typical pilsner smell : malt and hops taste : not to strong . nice and malty , with very low presence of hops . because of this , the bitterness is almost absent , but what is there , is just enough to give the beer a perfect balance . mouthfeel : thin and watery , but that is normal for the style . carbonation is medium-high overall : i will rate this one , compared to other pilsner beers because of course it will never beat any of the special beers out there . but for a regular pilsner , it is extremely drinkable . the taste is soft ( somewhat weak ) but man , this one goes down easy !'

S'pours a clear coppy with an 0ff-white film of a head that left a few lace spots . a little darker than i thought it would be , but more or less a typical barleywine appearance . sweet brown sugar aroma blends in with raisins , sherry and alcohol . considering this is around 6 years old , the alcohol is still very prominent . due to the aging , the hops have largely died down , pushing this beer more towards the english than american interpretation of the style . big caramel and dark fruit notes with some honey and a big hit of booze . medium-full mouthfeel with a restrained carbonation , which is highly appropiate to the style . certainly a slow sipper due to the evident abv and high sugar content , and perhaps seemingly a little young even at this point . perhaps fresh ( where the hops balance things out ) , or even older ( with added mellowing ) would be better for this beer . thanks to viggo for sharing .'

S"grabbed a couple bottles of this from the wellington & bradley lcbo , as rumour has it that grand river is axing town hall from their lineup . pours a tawny bronze with golden hues and one finger of bubbly white head . smell and taste are floral notes , cereal grains , toasted biscuit , caramel , a mild fruitiness , and some oats . finishes with a very subdued , almost soapy hop bitterness and hints of wheat . light-bodied mouthfeel is well carbonated , refreshing , a little watery , balanced dryness in the aftertaste . a flavourful and quaffable lager , but not the greatest beer from this brewery . still , it 's perfect if you want a tasty , low alcohol brew to session ."

S"had a lot of this at mile high music festival , in giant 22oz plastic cups . on a 99 degree day , this beer was heaven . let 's see how it old 's up to some scrutiny ... a- no different than a regular bud light . clear , pale yellow , fizzy thin head than fades fast . big carbonation bubble streams . s- bud light with a shot of lime juice right in the glass . no malt to speak of , and very little hops . just lots of lime . while not necessarily good , it has a certain quality that is uplifting and satisfying . very sweet and very sour . t- since bud light tastes like nothing , then bud light with lime 's equation is essentially 0+1 , so the taste is equal to one , one big ass lime plunked in here specifically . sweet and sour lime tastes. , i wish there was more to say . there is n't ; this tastes like lime , but not bad lime flavor . m- spritzy , carbonation fills your mouth swelling your cheeks slightly . rough , bubbly and thin . d- i got ta say , i could drink this all day outside . i mean , literally all day and never get tired of it . maybe i just really like lime , but something about this makes it so damn appetizing on a hot day outside . ridiculously drinkable , despite lackluster construction ."

S"this is a batch # 3 beer , bomber bottle , poured into a chimay goblet . not a lot of head at all , cloudy deep amber color to this one . it looks good but not great with the weak head . delicious nose ... rich , herbal , slightly hoppy . definitely stands out as a belgian-style ale . the taste is a little bitter up front , the herbal notes come through as well . it 's good but a little harsh and tougher to drink . not quite up to par with the best of the style but still a damn fine beer ."

S"a - yellowy..almost a orange juice like color . like most wheat beers a nice build up of foam . s - a yeasty/floral smell was present the hops were masked in the smell . t - citrusy ... almost watery at points , but had a clean finish . the taste was very mild . like in smell the hops were very faint and almost felt hidden . m - low carbonation which added to that watery feel . d - not offensive so these can be sessionable . very light weight , so it 's not very filling . overall - not a favorite of mine , but i 'm not gon na bash it either . might give it one more chance , but at this point it really does n't deserve it . i guess it felt bland to me , that why i had average ratings ."

S"a- pours a perfectly clear burnt orange with garnet highlights . the head is beige and dense with a pock marked membrane on top and it pretty much stations itself at a thick disk the whole time without leaving much lace behind . a constant column of superfine bubbles rise continuously releasing aromatics . s- tart and fruity with some spicy yeast in the background , it smells great but is pretty subdued , even at 55* . what is there is complex , as i 've come to expect from these fruity belgian red ales , with red apple and red plum , cherry , berries , and toasted bread with grape jelly . quality lambrusco wine and white muscadine grapes also come to mind with a caramel malty sweetness hiding in the shadows . despite the bottle 's claim to fragrant saaz hops , i ca n't detect much , but that 's ok cuz this smells great . t- taste is a little watered down and all those great notes of the aroma kind of become monotone with some apple cran-grape yeast , caramel malt , and cocoa toastiness jumping out here and there but not very loud . finish is weak as well with just a hint of dry grassy saaz hops ushering me out of the theater . mf- light and watery , but smooth and easily drinkable . medium light carbonation generates an overall 'blah ' feeling . a little filmy on the cheeks , but a pleasant aftertaste . d- not like the flavorful belgians i 'm used to , however its lightness and smooth character would make it a great brew to kick it with ( ice cold ) and maybe even straight out of the bottle ... oh no !"

S"a- copper/amber in color , the beer looks filtered , i 'm sure so it looks pretty in the glass . the head was an eyelash shy of a finger width . the head must be introverted and did n't want to stay and play , only partially stayed . the beer must be toying with me . s- there is a slight hop smell , not one that wants to punch your nose in , but it is there more like it is trying to give you the `` hey whats up '' look from the other end of the bar . the hop smell that is there is sweet and grapefruity . i also smell the smell of beer . you know that smell from back at college where all beers smelled the same and it was all about quantity and not quality . i 'm sure some of you know what i 'm talking about . as for those who do n't , either you had way too much money , or you never left the library . in other words this smells like an ab lager with pretend-a-hops in it . t- this has a funny taste , part of me was thinking chinese food . the malts are strange and more like a funny form of marzipan . the hops are just there to be bitter , not quite butt puckering bitter , but like fermented sour bitter . the hops were not allowed to play in this beer . it 's like communism in a bottle , the hops are n't allowed to do what they should be doing , which is to be free and let their essence come through . just like the hippies of the 60's-70 's in san francisco , they were one with the environment . m- as for the mouth feel it feels like beer , well duh it is beer , but there is a dirty after taste . sort of like the next day after a fun night of partying and that chick you were with just ca n't escape your taste buds . d- you could drink this . i 'm drinking this . i 'm sure it would be a great golden door for those who are still in the dark world of bmc lagers . however , it would be even better if they had used the hops properly , instead of using them for the sake of using them , and had a better malt character . is this the same malts they use for the lager ? did they also use rice or corn in this beer ? overall , it is n't horrendous , but most likely this beer is going to tailor to college people who think they are drinking sophisticated and the others who do n't know the difference between a lager and an ale and think that ale is a fancy term ."

S"2oz . room temperature pour into a stemmed glass . 2009 vintage . a million thanks to beerfmandy for sharing the wealth ! ( a ) - pours a hazy mahogany amber with reddish & golden yellow highlights depending on how you look at it . no carbonation , but the alcohol `` legs '' are just clinging to every millimeter of the glass like a beautiful whiskey or port . ( s ) - nutty , with sweet honey , toffee , butterscotch , and maple syrup . bits of figs , raisins , and marashino cherries . slightly earthy and rustic within the nuttiness . very tawny port-like . finishes with a light vanilla oakiness . ( t ) - very rich . sweet , with honey and nutty maple syrup . some brown sugar with a smooth vanilla-oak finish . some of that fig nuance inside the honey characteristic . i still taste it at least a minute + after each sip . so complex that i do not think i came even close to what is all in this beer ! ( m ) - a warmth of alcohol , but in no way overpowering or harsh , in fact , it is surprisingly smooth ! yes , it has a whopping 27 % abv , but it feels like much less than that . i am extremely surprised and impressed how easy this goes down actually . incredible feel and silkiness behind the warmth . if this was carbonated , i think it would ruin what this has to offer ! ( d ) - what a crazy beer . ridiculous on all levels , but surprisingly smooth with no serious alcohol bite . one sip of this has more flavor & richness than a whole case of your typical beer . definitely definitely a sipper ; only have an ounce or two at a time . this is far too special and good to consume mass amounts of it ( which i could if i wanted to ! ) a great after dinner nightcap to warm the bones in the heart of winter ! be careful , this is a dangerous brew ! i could sip this all night if i could . i would rate this even higher on the drinkability scale than i did , but this is just too special and unique to be something you have on a regular basis . so complex and tasty ! so many nuances in this , in my opinion , my review does not completely do this beer justice ! another thank you to beerfmandy for letting me try this incredible & spectacular brew !"

S"hmmm ... .a beer without hops . for a certified hophead this is a stretch , but how many pine beers are there , anyways ? 11.2 oz brown bottle for $ 3 . notched best by oct '05 ; made with spruce and pine sprigs collected in 1998 . i was a little afriad to try it at room temp , so i threw it in the fridge for about 20 minutes to put just a bit of a chill on it . pours a pretty nice looking clear dark red , with a small rocky white head . head quickly disappears to a small ring . leaves slight whisps of lace . the best way to describe the smell is `` beer-like . '' plenty of toasted malt in there , but it 's not quite right . a little bit of pine in the nose but it 's not too obvious . gee , i do n't know what to think about this one . odd . whoa . this is one weird thingamabob . i hesitate to call it beer . starts off pretty unassuming , almost like a brown . surprisingly sweet . finishes kinda dry , tons and tons of herbal characteristics in this . woody , muddy , nutty , thick . vaguely gin-like aftertaste . quite complex , and it 's hard to describe because i 've never really tasted anything like it . alcohol is noticable . it 's kinda thick in the mouthfeel , carbonation is fleeting . it 's a sipper for sure - alcohol and strong taste limit the rate of consumption . well , i 'm still not sure what i think of it . i could n't have more than 1 a year , that 's for sure . no wonder the vikings were mean , this is all they had to drink . still , everybody should probably try it once . there 's no way to tell if you 'll like it until you try it ."

S'22oz bomber taht says 5 % abv . pours a pourous tan head that quickly recedes without any provocation from my lips , nose or tongue , to a medium island of foam in the middle of the beer . a little bit darker than guinness , with just noticeable dark brown highlights . the aroma is a dru grainhouse roasted malt with notes of very light coffee and watered down chocolate . the taste has a upfront roated malt character with a bone dry hop and dark malt middle . te finish brings out the light brownie and coffee flavors . all very subtle , but great for a very sessionable dry stout .'

S"a : this beer is surprisingly sexy . i was expecting pale straw , but received copper . lacing is lively and active , but the head could use a bit of retention . sexy nonetheless . s : yeast bite , a touch of cereal grains , and a dash of creamed corn . t : not what i was expecting . this is much too clean to be an ale , i 'm calling shananegans . to me , this seems like a flawed amber lager , falling somewhere between yuengling and high life . the creamed corn that was in the nose has become the dominate player . m : very light and clean , with a touch of lively carbonation . d : not a terrible beer , but i would n't say that it 's worth importing , we 've got plenty of our own swill already . this would be a fine beer for whenever else a lifeless , imbalanced brew is called for . edit : immediately after reviewing this beer , i checked out the can and found the description , `` ale with caramel color added . '' in my eyes , this is cheating . since this copper color was based on lies , rather than malt , i am deducting 2.5 points from the appearance score , bringing it from a 4.5 to a 2 ."

S'amazing high alcohol . my rule of thumb for a great beer is would i pay for another . this one is no . the drinkability detrimental . the alcohol level is so high one is more than enough . it has a slightly slick mouth feel . roastiness is overwhelmed by the alcohol . i like roasty . the bottle had a lot of sediment , but that is not bad . my advice is to buy a case and split it with some folks . lay some down for a couple of years and it will be interesting to see how it develops . as you might expect the ere is no head on this beer . go get some schlafly reserve and be more impressed .'

S"pours to a clear black , but quite brown during the pour . forms a modest light cocoa colored head with average retention and lacing . has the trademark young 's aroma ... hard water , sweet cream butter , toffee , milk chocolate , butterscotch . mouthfeel is much different than the nitro-can for sure ... flittery with a medium body . taste echoes the aroma ... lots of butter . a sickly cloying , mineralized & oxidized ruddy mouthfeel of wet cardboard is inescapable . i notice a little bit of smoke on first sip that has since become less prevalent . bitterness is oxidized and mild . there 's a bit of roasted astringency towards the end . as it warms , it gets worse . tastes like a soggy buttered cardboard sandwich dipped in cigarette ashes . to think that 10 years ago , i thought this was good stuff . ok , so maybe i 'm babied by awesome stouts , but this one sucks . the ruddy mouthfeel and oxidized taste are awful , compunded by the year-old butter taste . ugh . down the sink it goes ."

S"appearance - probably the yellowest , lightest colored beer i 've ever seen . even bud light is n't this yellow . smell - not too bad . standard corn , hops , and a slight bit of alcohol . taste - very smooth and light . mostly refreshing . not offensive in the least . if you want a plain beer , go for this one . mouthfeel - very fresh and quenching . drinkability - being this as light as it is , you can probably down a few a night and still drink some more ."

S"tasted on-tap at flying saucer in charlotte , nc , from a tulip glass . appearance : beautiful ale , with a ruby-brown-hued body and one finger 's worth of head made of large bubbles on the pour . average time to recede , but the head came back easily with a swirl . smell : the most prominent note for me was the smoked or peated malt . it struck me as being a little bourbonish , but that could also have been some oak coming through . very pleasant aromas . taste : not surprisingly from the nose , lots of smokiness and a bit of oak . there was also some grassiness/herb-like flavors that came through for me when the beer was still a bit cool . licorice , touch of alcohol heat on the finish , and some spice . no hop character other than a slight bitterness on the finish . mouthfeel : very smooth , with carbonation that was perfectly melded into the rest of the beer . really coats the mouth . the carbonation died off a bit over the course of the pint . drinkability : i was surprised ( after drinking the whole glass ) to find out this is such a strong ale ! i would n't have considered drinking more than one at a sitting anyway , as the smokiness would probably get to me after the first one , but this beer does go down well as a sipper ."

S"i had this on draft a few months ago , and liked it , so i picked one up in a mix-a-six ... a medium pour revealed a half-inch head that subsided quickly . no lacing , and the head was gone in 20 seconds . hence the low appearance score . smelled ... fruity ? not much offensive , not much good . taste is average and watery . no detectable hops , only a little malt . almost like a dark bud light . mouthfeel was similar to a bud light or miller lite ( very thin ) , but very little carbonation . disappointing . drinkability is high , but that 's because it 's so watery . if i want bland-ish plain beer , i 'll drink a pbr and save the cash ."

S'tall off white head of frothy bubbles . clear golden amber in color with some bubbles rising to the surface . nice citrusy , somewhat grapefruity , hop aroma with some slight caramel maltiness on the nose . light medium mouthfeel with a soft carbonation . the head lasts a very long time and slowly bcomes a thin lace that sticks to the sides of the glass . mild malty start with a slight caramel and breadiness to it that creates a nice backbone . hops follow rather quickly . seems like there might be a couple different hops here , but im not all that proficient at identifying different types . a touch citrusy with grapefruit notes in the end . the malt backbone is present throughout though and stands out a bit more as the beer warms . the hops last a long time into the aftertaste . quite good , worth looking for again , yet fairly tame .'

S"i 've got to start by saying that this has been a favorite beer of mine even before i started really getting into beer . i first discovered it about seven years ago and found it refreshingly different . a- dark reddish-brown , but not opaque . it looks great ! s- smells very 'bubble-gum ' fruity . there 's malt there underneath , but not a 'bready ' smell at all . the alcohol is definitely there . t- yum ! very fruity , not much hops , with the malt way in the background - even behind the alcohol heat . mf- this beer sort of 'dances ' across your tongue . it feels like it 's a combination between the phenols and the alcohol . it 's actually quite pleasant - but different . it 's not astringent . d- the alcohol content is high on this one . personally , i have to buy the 12oz bottles in order to drink it if i want to also drink other beers . also , it may numb your tongue up a bit . all in all , a very fine beer . it 's complex and unexpected . if , in my youth , someone had told me beer could taste like this i would n't have believed them ."

S'this beer pours a slightly hazy golden yellow color , with a thin white head . the head fades slowly , leaving a decent lacing . this beer has a very mellow hoppy aroma . it smells slightly citrusy . some sweet malt aroma is also present . it smells well ballanced , but very mild . the taste is a little more hoppy than the aroma . still mild . some lemon zest , and a slight spicy hop flavor . it has a malty sweet flavor as well . this beer is a little over carbonated . it is crisp , leaving a sweet malty aftertaste . this beer would probably make a decent session beer . it is not too high in alcohol , and mello enough . overall : thanks to jwc215 for the generous hook up . this beer is a little week for an ipa . maybe more like a pale ale . other than that , it is pretty good .'

S"astringent is the word that comes to mind . attractive golden color , promising aroma . there is a hint of sweetness on the lips but immediately hits you with the full force of bitter hops . the wisp of belgian complexity is quickly overwhelmed . hint of spoiled fruit . oof , gets less tolerable with each sip . what 's wierd is that i tasted this a couple of times in 2009 and liked it -- i wonder if this bottle is a little bacterial . came from a store cooler in san diego ."

S'pours like black coffee . a little thicker than most oatmeal stouts . one finger of medium brown head resides for a minute or two before dissolving . smells strongly of chocolate and coffee . a little bit of malted barley and hops in the background , and maybe a flutter of fruit , possibly grapes nestled within the others . there seems to be a fight between the bitterness of the hops and the sweetness of the barley . should be an interesting taste . the taste is very rich . it is strong on the chocolate , while little sweetness is present . after the chocolate is realized , the subtle fruitiness is present , though faint . the coffee flavor is only tasted after the fact . anderson did well with masking the alcohol here . in the aftertaste , the hops are brought out with a slight coffee flavor . not a bad one to sit with for a while . mouthfeel is heavier than other oatmeal stouts , but is still light for the appearance of the liquid . not much of a film is left after swallowing , yet the aftertste is somewhat strong compared to other brews . drinkability is not the strong point here . the taste is almost too upfront and strong to warrent more than one or two in a sitting . although the taste is more intense than other oatmeal stouts , the aftertaste is rather pleasant . worth a try , but a repeat six-pack might not be in the future .'

S"pours into my tulip from a typically handsome green champagne bottle the color of cran-apple juice , deep red with a few tinges of gold-blonde ; a bit of experimental pouring comes up with a finger-thick yellowish-tan head of bubbles of quite varying sizes , from invisibly small to poofy . it 's hazy , and there are teeeny-tiny bubbles rising . the head sticks around in an opaque tan scum a millimeter thick , leaving behind a lazy wall of lacing on the far side and a sort of caramelization of the glass where the beer 's been on the near . okay , this is the first barleywine i 've ever tried ! i 'm not really sure what to look for here , so bear that in mind - and i may tweak this review later , depending on what i find with other beers the first scent i get , i jerk my nose back out of the glass - what the heck is that ? very familiar . very , very familiar . a pungent , grassy kind of scent - and then it comes to me ! this smells like dry cat food . yup . maybe petting zoo pellets , even . some steamed vegetables and cabbage - this smell is n't just malty , it 's positively rainforesty . hiding behind those pungent aromas are a few honey-slick scents of malt . i 'm not sure if this is what barleywine smells like , but it piques my interest . okay , yep , i see why the style is known as barleywine . if there ever was a beer made out of malts that was like wine , this style is it . it 's sweet all the way , with almost nothing bitter on the tongue except the bite of alcohol that is present . biscuits and honey , more earthy flavors and steamed broccoli , rum , rum , rum . lots of alcohol hanging out amidst the other flavors . this beer does n't hide its alcohol - it puts it right out in the open and says , `` hey , drunky , taste me ! '' this brew celebrates alcohol by putting it in a delicious manner right on center stage . great mouthfeel , i think , especially considering how much alcohol is present while drinking this one . a minimally fizzy wash douses the burn of alcohol and makes sure all the flavors go where they need to , then cleanses the palate almost completely , save for some very , very light honey tastes . well , for something as brash as this beer - it ai n't sweet , but that 's the only way to describe the combined heaviness and easy-to-drinkness of the flavors - it 's reasonably easy to drink . this glass of beer is half gone and my head is spinning cheerfully . i give it an above"

S'2009 375 ml bottle , $ 15 from the brewery . the label is nothing less than elegant . nice loud pop when i pulled out the cork . pours light brown with hints of red , almost like apple cider vinegar . quite clear with bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass and a few float up from the bottom of the glass to the top which is crowned with a one-centimeter rose-white head . fair retention and fine bubbles soon form a ring around the sides of the glass . nose is primarily made out of soured fruit , such as turning cherries or other fermented juices . touch of acetic oak reminds me of a classic flemish red , but more sour-focused . not an intense smell , takes an effort to get a reading , but what is there is good . the beer itself has a relatively high level of sourness . after the initial lactic sour rush there are lemons , slightly funky cherries , and only a touch of oaky vinegar-funk . for me this come off as a tasty american wild with a high sourness , but incorporates a tip of the hat to an old-world flemish . good stuff . light to medium body with a soft carbonation . more spritzy and active bubbles would definitely lighten up the body and leave the tongue ready for the next hit of sourness . lots of acid for your reflux . overall , very tasty and something for sourheads to try , though you may want to grab a friend to share this with . hopefully by the time the 2010 batch is released lost abbey will have sorted out the carbonation problems that have plagued it this entire year .'

S"first from the brewer : vergina beer is classified as premium lager . its ingredients are pilsen malt , caramel malt , hop , aromatic tettnanger hop , yeast and water . it is a product of classic fermentation ( 10c ) and it is distinguished by its fresh , rich taste . the harmonic coexistence of malt and hop defines its aroma from the brewer . '' as many have already stated this is not an octoberfest . this a very european pale lager style beer . in american terms it looks and tastes similar to the champaign of beers - miller high life . golden bright yellow . an uncomplicated , refreshing light lager . it has a bright white thick long lasting head which leaves distinct lace around the glass . very light hop and mild malty sweetness . clean , watery and refreshing . good tight bubbly carbonation . easy to drink in quantities . down side , nothing interesting here -- lacks flavor . nothing about it would remind you of greece , greek food or the mediterranean . i do not recommend it with greek food either particularly . this is a very commercial macro type beer . if youre on a yacht in the agean with a bunch of friends and you have to fill a cooler -- this will do . otherwise , not much to talk about ."

S"i 'll keep this one quick as in if you do n't have much good to say , you should n't say anything - but i 've been a fan of some of boaks ' creations ( monster mash , two blind monks ) and was surprised that this left a lot to be desired . without getting too specific , the flavor was somewhere between a real wooden beanie ( ? ) and a mouthful of pennies . it was quite acidic going down with a metallic aftertaste ... not quite what i expected when thinking about jack daniels and vanilla - both of which i got none of . i 'll stay away from this one ... ."

S'appearance : pours a hazy light amber color with a terrific head that lasts forever and leaves copious lacing ; unfortunately , this blonde bombshell disappoints once you get to know her smell : caramel , pineapple and way too much fusel alcohol getting in the way of everything taste : starts with an immediate blast of fusel alcohol that just builds and builds ; underneath that there are some nice flavors going on - caramel malt and pineapple and some pine but they just get lost in the shuffle of a bitter , alcohol-laden finish mouthfeel : full bodied and sticky with moderate carbonation drinkability : not a term i would associate with this beer , unfortunately'

S"poured from a bomber into a perfect . pours a brilliant clear copper . three finger head recedes to a light cap . stick is adequate , carbonation bubbles move slowly through the beer as if it is extremely viscous . aroma is maple syrup and molasses . slightly crackery aroma with brown sugar and allspice . slight hint of dextrose and cream . finishes with a bit of hop aroma . flavor is sweet dextrose malt . brown sugar , molasses and dark fruit . middle is hop and light metallic flavor . finishes hot and boozy , alcohol presence is definitely a huge part of this beer . mouthfeel is lush and soft . carbonation is small bubbled and creamy . close to perfect on the tongue . drinkability takes a hit as the abv makes this a sipper and the apparent alcohol hotness hinders the drinking a bit . a nice barleywine that brings a different take on the style , like very other i 've had . re-visited on 02-15-11 this is a big beer and i need to alter some of my scores . very big caramel and nutty flavor , huge malt flavor and the hops are perfectly muted for a bw ."

S"golden anny was the beer of choice my sophmore year in college , largely because you could get a case for under $ 10 . i can not give an accurate count of how many of these bad boys i managed to drink that year , but it was a number that was much higher than my gpa . i always saw this for what it was , really cheap swill that you could drink all night without leaving you with a hung over so bad you could n't do it again the next night and the next . this is fraternity hazing beer , pure and simple . i feel bad for someone that still has to drink this , it would mean that they 're still in college in western ma and they are entering year 19 of college ."

S"my bottle has a different label and says it 's the 2009 cellar reserve , so this must be a special run . the beer poured cloudy auburn in color , and had a one finger thick head that lasted for quite a while when left alone . there did n't appear to be any lingering carbonation after the initial pour . the aroma was very much like liquefied raisins with some slight pine in the background . the taste was sweet and vinous with a lot of toffee and very little hop presence considering the style . the sweetness was not cloying though , and there was a restrained spiciness in the finish . very clean tasting , with almost no hot notes , which made it very drinkable for a barleywine . the first impression made me feel that this was a little too light in the mouth , but the thickness seemed to be better after it warmed up . a straightforward , but extremely elegant drink ."

S'a- very hazy and light colored ... typical look for this beer , but poured into my pint glass with minimal head . s- strong bread aroma ( not a bad thing ) with slight hops and fruity scents t- faint malt sweetness and minimal hop flavor . more of a bland taste that leaves me expecting more flavor after each sip , but left disappointed to find there is no more coming . has a lingering yeasty aftertaste m- very carbonated , would be refreshing on a hot day ; i however am drinking this as i type at 12:30am in early april ... should have waited on this beer , but can appreciate the mouthfeel for what it was intended- a summer seasonal ale d- goes down smooth . i just now found that i have drank over 3/4 of beer just in writing this review ... it is easy to drink and would be very refreshing on a summer day overall , not the best pyramid beer i have had by any means . i understand they were going for a refreshing summer ale , but this really lacks taste . i will not purchase this any time soon , as i will be much more inclined to buy new beers to try and other more pleasing beers i have had before ...'

S"had this excellent beer on tap during max 's x-mas in july the other night . i foolishly purchased a 12 oz . glass , when a 4/5 oz . pour clearly would have been more then enough . this beer pours a dark brooding black color with impressive coffee color foam . lacing is quite good and there is excellent head retention . one gets chocolate and coffee ( a lot of coffee ) on the nose with a hint of vanilla . the nose is impressive , but it 's not overpowering , and does n't really prepare you for the flavor . on the palate this beer has a fabulous coffee/espresso flavor , with hints of vanilla and chocolate . the beer comes across as big and powerful on the palate , and is quite full bodied . the alcohol is noticeable and quite warming , and i remember thinking `` this one will put some glide in your stride . '' there is even a hint of chicory on the mid palate , and the beer has a good long finish . there is some bracing bitterness/dryness in the fnish , which keeps this beer from becoming altogether tiring to drink . the abv . is certainly noticeable , but not quite what i would call obtrusive - but it 's a close thing . as the beer sits in the glass i pick up some nuttiness and sherry as well . this beer is complex and quite impressive . a little bit of this beer goes a long way and there 's no doubt that it 's probably best drunk ( and appreciated ) in the winter time . this will defnitely keep you going on a cold winter night in baltimore . impressive ."

S"acid-washed maize . the style description says to expect a 'rapidly vanishing head ' , but i found that not to be the case . i 'm looking at a brilliant white mass of foam that topped out at three fingers after a vigorous pour and is still a respectable lid many minutes later . it does n't look that great , however . it is n't quite as soft , mealy and unsticky as a macro lager head , but it 's close . weisse smells like a lactobacillus-laden version of a euro pale lager . it 's moderately sour and mildly fruity . i have a disturbing feeling that 'moderately ' may turn into 'severely ' on the palate . although there is n't much to get excited about in the aroma department , the beer does have a snappy , green apple tartness that is sort of appealing . yowza ! each mouthful delivers a massive rush of sour acidity that still does n't come close to my limits of tolerance . for instance , it is n't anywhere near as mouth puckering as sour patch kids candy . bkw strikes me as a beer that 's sour for sour 's sake . a one-trick pony of sorts . the fact that flavored and colored syrups need to be added to make it palatable ( or at least to improve the flavor ) strikes me as gimmicky and goes against my purist bent . the only thing reminiscent of a weizen is the tanginess . otherwise , no wheat , no how . i can still appreciate the green apple flavor , but it 's less than expected . there 's no sweetness , no bitterness , just wall-to-wall sour . the mouthfeel is as light as a feather and the carbonation is middle of the road . i 'm almost done with the 11.1 ounce bottle and i ca n't feel even the slightest effect from the super-low abv . i was n't quite sure what to expect from this little bottle of berliner kindl weisse . now that 's it 's gone , i 'm still not sure how i feel about it . i like sour in all its forms , but this beer seemed to lack something essential ( probably the syrup ) . i 'm glad for curiosity 's sake that i gave it a try , but i doubt there will be any more berliner weissbiers in my future ."

S"dark cinnamon color with a thick , light beige head . decent retention . the last amber ale i had was santa 's private reserve , around christmas time , so it 's been a while . but after taking one whiff , i recognize and remember the style well . such an amazing balance ! it 's hard to say what exactly i smell first . the crisp citrus hoppiness and the smooth caramel maltiness blend beautifully . the taste is a little more bitter than i expected , but overall it matches the smell in its great balance . i would describe this beer as having a unique but totally accessible flavor that even the uninitiated should appreciate . nice , medium mouthfeel , highly drinkable . i have n't had a bad rogue beer ! i 'll definitely be getting this again ."

S"this apa pours bubbly , golden amber with just a bit of an orange hue speared in there . the frothy , pearl-white head holds well and allows for some nice thick lacey walls . great aromatic hops batman ! lord , that was weak but it just came out and now i 'm ashamed . in any case the hops are really boisterous for the style . pine and sticky citrus are all over the gorgeous bouquet of cascade hops . a strong malty platform provides some grain and a bit of toastiness . one of the best smelling apas i can think of . sweeter and milder than the nose would have you believe . mild citrus and light malt are evident . also some spice , vanilla , honey , and a decent hint of hops . lots of wholesome cereal breadiness . well balanced , sizeable , and satisfying . my only neg would be that the nose promised more hops than the taste delivered . full bodied and creamy but with a nice refreshing finish . an excellent warm weather beer that remains satisfying . nicely done and very well balanced . another good selection from one of my favorite breweries ."

S"5.5 month old bottle . pours a nice , clear mahogany with a half inch tan head ( poured very cold ) . impressive lacing but had hoped for a bit more out of the head . not much retention at all , with a thin film remaining throughout the glass . nose is excitingly complex . peppery hops are prominent , as are a couple of different malt scents . very sweet carmelly malts and sourdough bread . intoxicating alcohol , which is a bit much paired with the intense sweetness . flavor is full and complex but easy to pull apart . peppery , piney hops are prominent at the start , and their presence is felt bigtime in the bitter finish . the middle is full of dark fruits and alcohol , with some spicy pepper that might be coming from the hops . bready . this is well balanced , but i feel as though the alcohol is a tad too noticeable , and the hops are a bit conflicting in their fruitiness -- like the grapefruitiness from the hops does n't meld well with the dark fruits present . i had to dig pretty deep for these criticisms , though , this is really tasty . medium-high body with a lot of chewiness , especially as it warms . perfectly carbonated , but rather hot . slick . this bottle is labeled at 9.6 % , and the high abv is obvious . the alcohol hits you hard and fast , and i do n't usually want more than one . big time sipper . i generally do n't love barleywines , but i know a good thing when i see it . this is a great beer , and one that i would never turn down ."

S'this beer was quite deceiving to me . it is belgian and therefore i feel like i should expect something great . the beer was a decent lager and was quite drinkable . this beer may serve as a benchmark for american lagers and for that reason makes me appreciate them more . the overall appearance is that of a pale lager or a pilsner . the beer refreshes throughout and remains quite uniform as you drink the beer . the hops are what separates it from the average pale lager . definitely chosen with taste in mind . i think this beer is a great representation of the style .'

S"dear god , please send more kbs down to earth . amen dear santa , all i want for christmas is more bourbon barrel aged beers . maybe a redux of the wood aged weekend ? i will settle simply for a 6er of kbs , though . all i really need is that coffee and bourbon , the big wood and vanilla , angry notes of black magic . those things that make my gums tingle and my heart sing . bittersweet . perhaps some notes of chocolate and astringent wood and coffee . i have been ( mostly ) good this year . i should not have set off bottle rockets inside of the indian casino , but other than that , i think i 've been the model of `` what is good . '' thanks for listening , love , joe ps : the most recent bottle i had was way better than the watered down version that was my first experience of kbs . that first one alone is what keeps this from more 5s . dammit , kbs . i 'm going to have to make a shift in the ratings here on account of 2 of the 3 bottles now that i 've had not being at all up to the amazing record . only the middle bottle has been outstanding . the first was crazy over the top coffee , this one currently is bourboncentric . those two were from the same trade . zany , yes ."

S"pours a deep amber with a thin tan head that does n't retain particularly well . the aroma is very british in style , with notes of caramel and toffee , dark fruits , burtonized water , fruity esters , and some slight floral hops . the flavor is similar with soft caramel and treacle notes upfront , along with some apple and cherry , earthy hops , vanilla and a hint of oak , sharp carbonation and a kiss of alcohol . the mouthfeel is soft and smooth and drinkability is very good . a very understated irish red ale , probably more representative of the style than the hopped up american versions ."

S"picked up a bomber on my latest incursion into a chicago binny 's . was looking for a new ipa to try and heard good things about bear republic . why not try it ? poured many times into my brandy snifter . vision the pour leaves a beautiful amount of head that does not leave much lacing as it dissipates . the body is a stereotypical amber color , and when held to the light it matchs commerical apple juice . not bad , but not the best . bouquet the nose on this is quite enjoyable . it foreshadows a delicious brew . the spicy bitterness of the hops comes through in the very first breath . a slight citrus note is balancing the bitterness . perhaps , grapefruit in nature . flavor profile the bouquet was not lying for this beverage . the liquid sloshes around and releases the fruity flavors upon my tongue . they quickly change over into the bitterness of the hops which seems to linger into the finish . the end is n't anything to be ashamed of . it hits the bitter portions of my tongue and seems to hug the sides of it while leaving the rest clean . for a 7 % beer , this definitely does n't show up at all . not even in the last pours of the bottle do i find a hint of alcohol . this is not to say that it needs it , but it was unusual to not find it . oral sensations as ipas go , i do n't expect them to be syrup and i do n't expect them to be bottled water . however , this one tends to lead more towards a watery texture than what i 've become accustomed to . i think this actually benefits the beer rather than hinders it . as its texture is n't any thicker , it leaves a possibly cleaner finish . i put it somewhere just below some german pilsner 's i 've had . closing for the price that i paid for this brew , there is no doubt in my mind . buy it ! now ! it is delicious , affordable , and comes in a great size . i will definitely be purchasing this beer again , if not for its solid offering to the ipa style than for its price tag ."

S'a : poured into a snifter at the red in santa cruz . color is a mix between quadrupel brown and cherry red . decent head for a style characterized by acidity . s : oak , brett , vinegar , cherry . t : nice red fruit sweetness is decapitated by an exquisite tartness and vinaigrette bite that puckers every corner of the mouth . some oak and grape skin . m/d : thin bodied , dry , effervescent , and smooth . the only fault is that the sharpness is best in small doses , reducing the drinkability to me .'

S'at the brick store pub on august 30th , 2008 -- about 3 hours before alabama slaughtered clemson in the georgia dome . see my review for bottle : the main difference between this beer on-tap and out of the bottle is an even creamier mouthfeel , which gives way to enhanced drinkability . additionally , much more lace is present and the head retains at a 1/2 inch from start to finish . flavor is slightly more vibrant on-tap , as well .'

S"i had two of these with a ny strip while out to dinner . this pours froma very appealing bottle into a chilled ( wtf ? ) pint glass . light amber gold with a half-finger head . not much goin on in the nose other than very typical grapefruit and lemon rind hop scents . smells generic but very pleasant . taste is also pretty standard for and ipa . really , nothing is striking me as being special or outstanding with this one , but it is very good . a good standard ipa . i like this one for it 's extremely high drinkablility and refreshing qualities . nothing really grabbing my attention , but i would definitly pick up a sixer ! good , but not outstanding ."

S"i usually stay away from ipa beer but my friend had some of these so i thought to give it a try . it poured a pale murky yellow with a nice head and decent retention . the smell was almost all citrusy hops and then the taste ... .not something i enjoyed . almost no malt flavors just powerful lemon rind hop bitterness with a sharp dry to dehydrating finish . very unbalanced , tasted like sucking on a hop pellet . i know this is an ipa but damn , just over the top and lacking any complexities . anyone could over hop a beer and produce the same result . the mouthfeel was very crisp , loose and dry , about what i would expect for the style . i will praise this beer for its drinkability though . despite its obnoxious hoppyness , it 's surprisingly easy to drink and that is quite remarkable in itself . this really was n't an awful beer but like so many of this style it seems to have lost touch with what a beer really is , a malt beverage , hops should be used mainly for the preservative qualities and complement the malts . i guess i 'll never understand the whole ipa hype ."

S"pours a deep mahogany brown , not quite black but damn close . even with an extremely hard pour there was only a handful of bubbles that formed . what little bubbles did exist stuck decently to the glass but hardly what i would call lacing . smell is odd , to say the least . lots of dark fruits , almost sour but not quite . very light acrid roast aroma mixed in with the fruits . the combination is not pleasant but not all together bad either . taste is better with less of the dark fruits and a little bit more chocolate . the roast is n't as bitter as the smell would make you think . it 's actually not that bad by itself but that aroma sticks around and in this particular glass it is focused to my nose which just makes it worse and somewhat difficult to enjoy the good flavors . thinner body with light , but very much present , carbonation . i would like this to be a tad bit thicker as an oatmeal stout but it 's not bad at all . overall , i might try this again down the road , it 's a bit different but not really bad . as it is though , if i want an oatmeal stout i will probably go elsewhere ."

S'a - partly cloudy reddish brown with some of big bubbled head which lasts . not a lot of carbonation is visible . s - strong smell of caramel and sweet malts , not quite covered by the floral pungency of the hops . the smell is very malty compared to the taste . alcohol smells emerge as the beer warms as well as more bready and grainy notes in the nose . t - very strong hop flavour and incredible bitterness follow the smooth entrance of some sweeter malts giving the taste of bread and biscuits . the finish is whip quick and very drying . the bitterness is sharp and lingers in your mouth . tastes of hops emerge out of the bitterness more and more as the beer warms , giving impressions of pine needles and dried leaves . m - very drying due to the bitterness , rather rough and slightly thick and clingy . d - this beer has considerable moreishness , but i could hardly drink it all night , too complex , and too strong . and even though i hate to admit it , maybe even a little too bitter .'

S"a= pours a translucent yellow color slightly darker than your average american macro lager with a large billowing white head that falls fast and just sits on the top of the beer in a very thin sheet . s= lots of grainy malt in it . there 's also a hop front on it . sort of a stinky german smell too . i enjoy the odor just for the odd stink that it has . t= really sort of plain for a beer from surly . clean as hell . it says the hops take the back seat on the can which i do n't find to be true . i think the hops over throw the sweet grain while the sweet grain is still present . not bad but not amazing either . m= low carbonation and smooth finish . d= very high . this is a surly beer for everyone . really nothing special about it and sort of rediculous due to the hype that surrounded the release . i would prolly not buy it again if it came out regularly just because its so plain for the price . still a good beer though ."

S"a- at this point i was optimistic , as this beer has a very interesting color with hints of amber and purple . s- it has a clear raisen smell , which is not great , since raisens stink and smell a bit sweet for a beer . this was the dominant scent , with no hop freshness . even for a quad , it is loaded with a sweet aroma right up front . this beer is certainly not trying to blur the catagory . t- right from the start , it gives you a boozey hit of excess malt/raisen flavor , which turns to a adjunct-like alcohol finish which did not impress me . it can be noted that there were no hop flavor at all , not just diminished or overshadowed , but completely not present . this is the first quad that has made me physically cringe from the transition to the after-taste . m- aside from the taste , it has a decent mouthfeel , but there again , i barely remember it after the taste . this beer has a body that makes it very smooth in your mouth for a high gravity beer . this is in fact a very big beer as far as malt ( 8.5 % not too high gravity ) d- this beer has no drinkability . i might enjoy it as a gimmick or in a taster , however a 64 oz growler to split between 2 is completely rediculous . we were covered in sticky malt , and frowns as we could n't handle the sugar shock for more than about 2 pints . in summary , a quad should have a lot of malt , but the key is to balance that power with flavor and complexity . aside from tasting like prune juice , this beer is not complex . while i appreciate the extreme take on a beer , and the daring attempt to make raisens cool again , i just did not like it at all . it reminds me of my friend who tried to homebrew with berries , and he did not cut back on the malt ... it just tasted defective ."

S"thin , bitter golden ale . beautiful appearance with endless lacing . ditto the mouthfeel , with good carbonation and creaminess . starts with a hint of malt and a refreshing watery taste . but a needless over-bitter hop assault takes over . quite acidic . no hint of sweetness but maybe a touch of roasted malt . the initial sensation is good , but the aftertaste is so long and so bitter the thrill is soon gone . but i 'll save it to mix with huber 's simpler times , a cheap , sweet lager begging for a kiss of the heavy hops . so this is a matter of taste , but it seems like sharp , highly hopped ales should be in the pale ale category ."

S"here 's the thing : i 've never drank any version of american macro-lager . no bud , coors , miller , pabst , etc . none of it . my first beer was newcastle brown ale , and i 've tried many styles of beer , except that one . that having been said , i know that alpine glacier lager , while not an official macro-lager , should taste similar to those , according to the description on beeradvocate . so , my review should be read with an eye towards my limited experience with these styles . the color is a bright yellow , and no head formed when poured into my glass . it almost appeared like lemonade , except for some bubbles floating skyward from the bottom of the glass . the smell reminds me of blue moon , with minor hints of citrus and grains . i did n't get much flavor at all . perhaps i 'm expecting too much , as most of my beer-drinking experience is with belgian ales and other , more complex drinks , but there just does n't seem to be much here . it 's very light , with subtle flavors of citrus , honey , and malt , with a little bitterness at the end . there is a nice flavor in the middle that pleasantly reminded me of warm toast . no lingering aftertaste . mouthfeel approaches soda or carbonated citrus drinks : lean and easy with a fizzy character . if this beer is characteristic of the style , i probably wo n't be drinking many of these . there 's just nothing of interest for me here ."

S"a new ipa , made in canada ? ok , twist my arm ... pours an absolutely clear pale golden colour , with a few fingers of thick foamy white head , which leaves consistent lacing around the glass . the aroma is of cereal grain , the malt being the only thing coming through , until it warmed a bit , and then a bit of floral hoppiness was detectable . the flavour also starts with that cereal graininess , but gains a moderate kick when the resinous hops appear . at first , they seem very tame , but after a few swigs , they become more intense . the carbonation is low , the body quite full , and the finish quick and dry . the slightly elevated alcohol is n't noticeable . this is a reasonably tasty beer , and easy to drink , however , the $ 4.00 per single cost would limit its appeal for a session . i know that 's the price for a small-batch limited release , but i 'm just sayin ' . having just indulged myself in american ipas during a trip south of the border last week , this offering from the ( very ) great white north seems a bit lacking in comparison . but as it 's listed as an english-style ipa , it then would seem to be a bit hoppier than it should be . perhaps there should be a new style - canadian india pale ale - one that befits the dual influences of england and america on our own culture ( and , apparently , beer ) ."

' probably imparted by the fruit factor . while slightly undercover in the aroma , the cherries are big in the mouth . there is a slightly-sweet , slightly-sour tart flavor all throughout the mouth , front-to-back . strangely -- at least in my mind -- it compliments the deep-roasted flavor of the stout very pleasantly . the tartness of the cherries sticks throughout the mouth , like eating half a bag of sour patch kids . well , not that tart . but close . the resulting mouthfeel from the tartness is my only complaint here . not overly sweet , like so many fruit beers . this is likely my last craft brew before i leave for the beer wasteland of south korea for the summer , and it was a pleasure . not sure i could handle more than a couple pints on any given night , but it goes big with its flavors . makes it work , and well ."

S'dark brown with a huge light tan head . some lacings . aroma is bread dough yeasty . taste is sweet doughy dark caramel and a kiss of hop bitterness . easy drinker with not a lot going on . nothing bad mind you just a bit of a beginner bock . carbonation was a bit too much . very sessionable with the 5.2 % abv . this is the first time that leinenkugel has made an appearance on the left coast . not bad .'

S"had on tap at the elkhart brewpub . a- poured a light hazy pinkish purple looking color . one finger off white head that dies rather quickly . light soapy lacing on the sides of the glass . s- artifical raspberries right up front with this . this makes for a very sweet aroma throughout the entire nose . wheaty undertones and something else that i ca n't put my finger on make up the overall aroma . t- light wheat upfront gets crushed from the middle on with a huge raspberry flavor . once again this is very artifical tasting ... ending with a bitter wheat balance that just ca n't break the sweetness of this beer . m- medium mouthfeel . carbonation was good for the style . could n't understand why this felt heavier than it should have for the style . raspberry dominate the entire palate and long into the aftertaste . flavor was pretty one sided and i thought this kind of killed the entire mouthfeel . d- even though this beer was sweet by the time you got to the end of the glass it did n't bother you anymore . a good `` chick '' beer but the higher abv gives it the little kick it needs . should have no problem drinking this all night ... you just need to get through the first glass that 's all ."

S'served in a snifter : wow ! this ale is definitly one of a kind . as i pour this demon of an ale i am surprised at the head considering the abv.the head rose to a two finger width but disapated to one quarter inch then to a small white ring within two minutes.the color is a dark almond upon first glance.yet when held to the light it reveals shades of amber , pumpkin , and burnt sienna . the nose hairs really stand up on this one ! wafts of molasses , vanilla , and a even a slight sweet bourbon aroma.the complexity on my tongue is almost to much to handle.totally caught me off gaurd.the sweetness of this colossal brew is quite interesting and cloying at the same time.flavors of oak can be detected vaguely.alcohol really blazes through my mouth along with the sweet molasses again.as this ale warms the accents in taste and aroma are even more potent.the mouthfeel is really smooth , even syrupy . this brew would be great as an after dinner desert drink , but i could not have more than one per sitting.i think this beer would be a good canidate for cellar ageing . -cheers2beers'

S"had this on tap at an oktobefest celebration at lucky baldwin 's delirium cafe in sierra madre , ca . a- pours a nicely looking burnt orangish to red . nice thick head sits up there with great retention . not lookin too bad to start off . s- not sure how to really describe it . it almost smells like you would predict the taste ... cloying . its very sweet , some weird stuff in there too ... probably the high alcohol . t- very hard to drink . there 's alcohol , there 's cloying sweetness and a toastiness that 's trying to peak though . it does n't work well at all . d- too syrupy , does n't make for a good oktoberfest style beer at all . i understand that it 's all about doing certain styles `` imperial '' these days ... but seriously , cmon . this is not a style that lends itself to the imperial . this was just flat out bad . the only reason anyone would give this a good score is if they are partial to avery , or if they wanted to really believe that avery is on to something new here with an imperial oktoberfest . they are n't . i did n't finish more than a few ounces so i gave it to my friend , and he could n't finish it either ."

S'a - thick , dark brown . verging on black . pours very thick and leaves a syrup like coat on the glass when swirled . very still with no head and only a few carbonation bubbles . s - incredibly strong aroma from the instant you pull the cork out . people arent joking about the soy sauce aroma . some burnt sugar and alot of booze as well . smells alot like the marinade i make for stir-fry , just soy sauce and brown sugar . actually a rather interesting smell and not near as unpleasant as i was expecting . t - wow , what the heck is this ? very boozy with some dried fruits and still teh strong burnt sugar taste . hints of maple syrup as well . i tried to give this one a fair crack , but the taste is just not good . it is very unique though so i will give it a small bump for that . m/d - very oily , coats the mouth . even if you liked the taste i am not sure the drinkability would be that good . maybe it is past its prime , hell , it is 10 years old . or maybe it has always been horrible . whatever it is , it sure isnt worth the price now .'

S"i 'm assuming i just do n't get this beer . to have this be called `` beer '' seems a bit of a stretch for me . i have n't had a ton of lambics but i can see why they add fruit to this stuff and i probably wo n't be having more of these . appearance : hazy amber color similar to a pale ale with virtually no head . smell : tart and vinegary . maybe that wet horse blanket smell that people always talk about but to me it was more like wet arm pits . taste : mouthwatering and puckering . it was like drinking bad lemon juice or sour white grapes . if i had something like this in my fridge and it smelled and tasted like this , i 'd throw it out . mouthfeel : medium bodied i guess . it was definitely carbonated but it was n't something i wanted to leave in my mouth that long . drinkability : could n't do it . it ended up in the drain . i had other non-ba 's sample this all with the same nose curling results . i 'm sure this is an acquired taste . it took me time to acquire a taste for ipa ' s but even my first ipa i said , `` not bad ... i can see getting into this '' . not so for this . i do n't want to be closed minded so i will probably re-visit this style again but it will be an exception no the norm . to each his own but damn ... this stuff was rough ."

S"spotted this on my way to visit relatives recently . loved their stout , saw this ale , figured `` why not ? '' . color is orangeish-brown , with a white head when poured . half the glass was head at first . definitely smell the hops . a citrus type scent in there too . for a high-gravity , does n't smell like it . the taste is prominently hoppy , yet sweet . the hops come up more as it gets to the bottom . mouthfeel is relatively thick , seems to coat for a moment as it goes down . not bad , but not as complex as i expected . though , maybe that 's just the style . i give it the high mark for drinkability because , even though it 's a seasonal release , it does n't fall into the habit of being so distinct that to have it other times seems weird . overall , rather good , score another one for lagunitas ."

S'ample creamy tan head is not retained diminishing quickly but never disappears producing little lacing . the body is dark brown color and rather opaque , however , when held to light the beer is clear and dark amber with a ruby hue , due to the munich malt , with low carbonation . the nose is first dominated by steely carmel malt aromas then bittersweet chocolate notes with hints of sweet maltiness come through . brown sugar and a raw malt smell are detectable as the beer warms . unfortunately no real hop character is present in the nose , perhaps german noble hops were not used . the taste starts slightly sweet , of caramel , quickly turning bitter with hints of bittersweet chocolate , as with the nose . a full bodied well balanced middle of sweet and bitter with the brown sugar really coming through as it warms . finishes with bitter roasty maltiness and very faint hop bitterness . overall there is a bitter roasty malt taste to the beer , not as balanced and complex as guidelines suggest for style . mouthfeel is watery with slight oiliness but finishes a little dry . the rich taste and light mouthfeel combined with the low alcohol level ( 4.7 % ) make this a very drinkable session type beer . i enjoy this beer and drink it often as it is inexpensive ( +/-r $ 1.50 ) .'

S'a : nice cooper pale ale in color , poured it hard at 39f in a mug , got a nice creamy white head of nearly 2.5 inches . let lacing down the sides after a few minutes . s : well at first at cold temps you get all the stuff the bottle talks about . peppery , you got the grains of paradise . some citrus ( lemon like ) , some clove and banana , reminds me more of a hefe than anything . not sure if that fits the style but with its a sasion like ale in the style of . t : banana , cloves and tart citrus hits you first . malty back bite . some hops . as its warms it turns to more of a bread like taste , with the pepper bite . missing a brett bite/flavors . no secondary fermentation done in bottle , sort of defeats the saison style in my mind . m : seems smooth and very easy on the mouth , in fact i could swear its weihenstephaner hefeweissbier clone . d : not to bad , its not the easiest i had to drink but its not undrinkable , its semi refreshing . i have to try a few more . i mean its summer type of beer , but sadly falls short to me . i may change this as the sample pack came with only 2 beers , so it sort of breaks my own rules about reviewing on 1 beer . not a big fan of american brewers making belgian styles but that my pet peeve . its not a horrible attempt but its not a great one either .'

S"the beer of pennsylvania . not really something i 'd be too proud of , considering we 've got victory , stoudts , and yards , but decent . its got a nice dark color for a semi-mass produced lager , and a decent smell and taste . one thing i dont like about it is the use of corn . it definitely gives it a distinctive taste and mouthfeel . when this gets warmer it quickly loses drinkability , and the mouthfeel suffers as well . however , this is still a much better beer than macrobrews , and is incredibly cheap in pa. $ 1.75 to $ 3 pitchers of lager ( the only thing its ever named as ) are common here in state college , which makes this one of my staples . try it if you can , but dont go out of your way ."

S"pours from 12 oz bottle a hazy amber color , with a thick and creamy head which leaves only a minimal amount of lace . looks pretty good so far -- it better for the insane price tag ! i can immediately smell the hop aroma even though i 'm standing over the glass as i pour . fairly impressive amount of hop aroma there , but that 's almost all i get . there 's a faint breadiness hiding out , mingling with the hops , but i can hardly detect any malt . flavor is quite nice , much more balanced than i was expecting . there are impressions of ripe sweet fruits and berries hiding under the bitter hop layer . you can really taste the pronounced simcoe bitterness , but there 's a surprisingly sweet malt that manages to cut through it and make itself known . mouthfeel ... well , good , but it does n't quite live up to the flavor . it 's fairly nice and thick , which i like , but it 's also a bit stickier than i would prefer . i 'm having to wipe the sticky mess off my mouth after every sip . obviously there 's a lot of residual sweetness there to cut through those hops ! all in all , i ca n't say this beer is very drinkable . partly because of the excessive cost and partly because of the sticky mess . it tastes great , but the two major downsides make it an impractical brew that i will probably never buy again . it 's good , but certainly not worth the price of admission !"

S"this interesting barley wine poured an uncharacteristically dark gold color . very nice 2 inch head of off white dense bubbles which left some islands of lace with each sip . the smell was interesting . no doubt the generous usage of rye contributed to this . complex aromas including tropical fruits as well as raisins and a rum like booziness . bready yeast notes as well . unlike the usual american barley wine , the piney hop resins on the nose were no where to be found . my initial sips were greeted with a cloying sweetness which turned into a hot booziness . the tropical fruits were there as well , which further enhanced my feeling that it had a dark rum like quality about it . rum soaked raisins , spices and a weird sweetness , which faded into a hot alcohol finish as i exhaled after each sip . the citus hop notes seemed to blend into the tropical fruit/hot rum flavors to me . i scored it above average in taste as there were certainly some complex flavors going on . however , i 'm not sure about how some of them mesh . the mouthfeel was the star of the show . a velvety slickness coated my mouth with each sip . it was very rich and luxurious , and fit the complexity of this beer well . as of now , the drinkability is not there yet . just too sweet and hot . both of these will fade with time in my opinion . i have a second bottle that i 'll sit on and revisit in the future to see if this smooths out ."

S"a= no pop when the cork comes off . pours a dark brown almost black color with no head whatsoever . the color is decent i suppose but the head lets me down sooo much . s= lots of chocolaty notes . vanilla is there for sure and lots of brandy . really great smell . caramel is there too with lots of toffee . i love the smell . t= the initial taste is nothing at all . when it first hit my lips i thought they also forgot to flavor the beer . then the amazing flavor washes over my tongue . i think the lack of carbonation did n't allow the flavor to fully penetrate my tongue upon first sip because the following sips are great . toffee , chocolate , loads of vanilla , oak , and toasty greatness . really hot in my belly but nothing in my mouth . the carbonation is missed but i guess thats not a problem with taste . m= really smooth i wish it had carbonation . if it did i would imagine the mouthfeel to rival westy 12 but there is no carbonation so i cant really say . feels like motor oil going down . d= tastes great and smells wonderful . the carbonation problem is the only downfall for this beer . really tastes great . could be one of the best in the world but , well as i already mentioned it has no carbonation ."

S"served : on tap at the addison flying saucer in what appeared likely to be a 22oz wheat beer glass . a : poured a very murky ( maybe the murkiest beer i 've ever seen ) medium to dark brown with a light ivory/brown 2 finger head . this beer retained head for a decent while and had nice lacing on the glass as i drank it . s : lots of smells that reminded me of a hefeweizen . banana and clove seemed apparent , bready yeast in the nose , no alcohol present but also a nice sweet characteristic . t : this beer tasted absolutely delicious . nice sweetness balanced with the malt sugars . i have to get to the saucer to have this one again as it seems once live oak beers are gone , they 're gone forever . m : somewhat thick and viscous i felt it was a little thick for a wheat style beer even though this is a bock as well . it may have benefited from stronger carbonation , but still nice . d : i really only wanted one of the 22oz of these , even though the taste was off the charts ( good ) for me . i would definitely drink it again and hope i get the opportunity to do so . it was somewhat heavy which is what prevented me from drinking multiples of this ."

S"about a shot 's worth served from a 750 ml copper bottle into a duvel tulip , on repeal day ( 12/5 ) served at cellaring temperature . a : pours a clear medium-brown body with amber accents . absolutely no carbonation or head . no lacing on the glass , but the liquid leaves trails like a strong hard liquor would . s : very , very strong with alcohol . some woody tones like oak are present , as well as a light brown sugar and caramel sweetness . i can smell the alcohol while the glass is about two feet away . it 's that strong . t : wow . brown sugar and caramel are definitely the most present , after getting over the strength of the alcohol . it reminds me of a weak cognac . a sugary alcohol aftertaste remains . m : full bodied , not even a hint of carbonation , with an incredible alcohol bite . afterfeel is very , very dry . d : to categorize this as an `` american strong ale '' is a complete understatement . hyper or super strong ale maybe , but this is nothing to mess around with . the alcohol is serious , it comes up quick and does n't leave any room for forgiveness . i had about an ounce of it , and that was enough to satisfy me for the rest of the evening . i hate to do it , but this is the most undrinkable beer i 've ever come across as a beer drinker , it simply is just too strong . the alcohol factor is terrible , i personally hate hard liquor , and this brew is just that . loads of booze , i cringed at every sip and shuddered at every swallow . if i were reviewing it as something else , the numbers would be different . but as a beer , it sucks . if i wanted to get trashed quickly , there 's a lot of $ 10 bottles of hard liquor out there . this was definitely not worth the amount i paid and the extent i went through to get it ."

S"it pours a beautiful , dark mocha color with a white frothy head that is rimmed with larger , brown bubbles . it smells of raspberry liquor and chocolate . it reminds me of the deep fudge raspberry cake i love to make for special occasions . i also detect underlying notes of malty caramel . it has a nice , creamy feel to it , and it tastes almost smoky rather than roasted like i thought it would be for a beer that smells and tastes kind of like coffee . it has a very muted , earthy finish . the first state is almost sour , and then chocolate , coffee , and raspberry flavors subtly add their presence . i would have to give this beer a kind of low drinkability rating since the smoky finish increases as i move along the point , almost to the point where i feel like i 'm licking an ashtray . with cocoa powder dusted on top ."

S'pours a nice foam on top of the dark beverage . smell is sweet and honey is strongly present . also tastes sweet . one of the most honey flavoured honey beers i have ever tasted . mouthfeel is quite smooth . not bad at all . the biggest setback of this ale is the sweetness which makes the consumption , say , difficult . ok , you might expect a honey beer to be a bit sweeter than most other ales but this dark honey beer is probably the sweetest beer i have drank so far . in sum : a decent or even a good ale if you can cope with the sweetness .'

S'i have had english ales but not much ; so i would still consider this one of my early forays into the world of english ales . the duchy ale comes in a nice 500ml bottle with nicely designed labels to make it look classy . this beer pours out a brownish or amber golden color with a small head . it smells yeasty and slightly foral . the taste is mainly ale yeasty and slightly malty and is pretty good but what was not too nice was the thin body and the overly high level of carbonation which leads to a not-so-satisfying mouth feel . this also causes the merely 5 abv ale to be less significantly less drinkable . the after taste is pleasant but does not seem to get better over time . i gave it a 6.5 instead of a 7 or 7.5 because of the unsatisfying mouthfeel and drinkability . frankly the taste is pretty nice and comfortably mellow .'

S'not overly impressive or lasting head on a beautifully hazy dark brown ebony color body . the smell is wheaty but also shows notes of pear , apple and alcohol . in the taste , the wheat gets overwhelmed by a darker , more roasted malty flavor , and by the fruitiness of apples and pears already noticeable in the smell . alcohol is clearly , and excessively present . 8 % are hard to hide , for sure . carbonation is a bit low to clean the palate of this excess of alcohol . the finish and aftertaste are chewy and dont fit in the style . lacking sweetness and a refreshing character . something interesting here , a nice try , but not a success . undrinkable alone , i couldnt drink half of the 330ml bottle ; maybe paired with some food , it could be a little better . two thousand miles behind aventinus .'

S"i 'm not the biggest fan of ipa , which is overall one of my least favourite styles but , ironically , i generally prefer double ipas . this is a good one , although not something i would drink often . i think the extra alcohol and malt , along with the use of hop flavours rather than simple bitterness really is the key . it 's gold with a thick , lasting white head and good lacing . the aroma is extremely hoppy , but pleasantly so , being very floral and even soft and sweet , with some malty caramel quality underneath . the taste is bitter and very hoppy in flavour . it 's somewhat complex and interesting with a lot of flowery pine and citrus and has a good , fairly strong malt body , richness , with smooth sweetness to balance the hops . my biggest problem is that it feels , especially in the finishing bitterness , like it 's drying my toungue with a thick towel , which is rather unpleasant . this is a rough , unnecessarily harsh hop element that i do n't care for in the least and i can not remotely understand why anyone would enjoy it . it 's somewhat interesting and flavourful , but for me not all that drinkable ."

S"euro-bomber purchased at j.b. 's in spokane for $ 3.59 . no obvious freshness/expiration date to be seen , though the back label is stamped `` 1507 . '' those crafty krauts have created their own dating system . poured an astonishingly pale straw color , with a big , creamy yet fizzy bone-white head . no lace to speak of . when it comes to weizenbocks , i 'm more used to the interpretation one associates with , say , aventinus , so the looks of this was ... unsettling . before it warmed up a little , i was worrying that i might have somehow purchased a bland eurolager . banana-ish cloves are the primary scent here . way in the back is an earthy grain scent . not bad , but there 's not nearly as much going on here as i expected . the taste is more interesting than the smell , but it 's not exactly a worldbeater . this can be described as mildly fruity tasting . you know how when beers have gotten old and/or mistreated , and they have that off flavor that 's like applejuice gone wild ? imagine that , but tamed down to a degree where it 's actually balanced tasting . there 's also a honey-like sweetness that balances the apple flavor well . hops are conspicuous by their apparent absence . relatively light-bodied , with a somewht watery yet slick mouthfeel , if that makes any sense . insanely drinkable for a relatively high abv beer . i can see having a few of these in a bar would be a bad idea . sitting at home i could probably have severa l in a sitting and seem fine , then pay the cost the next day . however , i just do n't find this to be that compelling of a beer . too bad , as i 'd heard a lot about it and was rather jazzed to discover it around here ."

S"2006 bottle pours a brilliant copper orange color , and a two finger head . decent retention slowly falls , leaving behind tons of lace . aroma is well balanced between malt and hops . slightly sweet , and a bit of citrus aroma from the hops , this is an enjoyable nose . flavor is mild , yet full . malty , caramel sweetness up front , followed by a nice punch of hop flavors and bitterness . again , slightly citric hop character , seeming using all the usual suspects of the `` c '' hops in a typical american ipa . no alcohol present . mouthfeel is full , and slick . drinkability is excellent . one of the better beers from sierra nevada imo . not nearly as interesting as bigfoot , but still one that i look forward to each year . good overall , but not the greatest ipa out there ... ."

S"- tasted at split thy skull 2011 at mugs alehouse - 1999 bottle drank in march 2011 . a - dark apple cider . low white head with ok lace . s - brown sugar , almond , cider . some of the maple syrup comes through . t - tangy malt and booze with a light cider character . woody oak flavors on the back end . m - deep , dry finish with woody notes . medium-light body . d - ok flavor . the alcohol is n't oppressive but i 'd rather spend the abv 's drinking other beers ."

S"appearance : medium golden color , quite clear , with a small white head , and slight carbonation . aroma : sweet , malty aroma , with a slight smoky pepper note . taste : opens with a slight sour , or tart malt note , a mild hop presence appears midway through the taste . the taste draws to a close with a mild , lingering , earthy pepper note . in my judgment , the pepper note is rather restrained , but i frequently consume large quantities of hot pepper , so this beer might seem hotter to others . mouth feel : smooth , soft , fairly full , pleasant . drinkability/notes : overall , a well-balanced example of a novelty style . much better than the ubiquitous ed 's cave creek chili beer . although i have tried few examples of this uncommon style , i feel rogue has excelled within the constraints of the style . presentation : packaged in a twenty-two ounce brown glass bomber bottle with a pop-off crown and a painted label . in keeping with rogue 's custom of releasing the same beers under different labels , this example was actually called `` rogue mexicali ale '' ."

S"a- pours a cloudy deep gold color . i honestly ca n't tell if the cloudiness is from lack of filtration or chill haze , but i 'd lean towards chill haze . 2 finger cap of foam has amazing retention , along with superb lacing . better head than a $ 5k hooker ... s- big time hops , dry papery grains , very slight aspirin medicinal dryness , and a touch of malt caramel notes . very nice . f- holy citrusy hops batman ! seriously huge citrus hops , on the front , back and middle . excepeptional complexity of hops , even within the `` citrus '' category . malt flavors are promient on the finish , and can almost become cloying towards the end . incredible flavor and balance . m- thick and creamy for the style . damn close to perfect . d- overall great , but inconsistent . i generally love this beer , but it is n't perfect . a touch less sweetness or less crystal malts would go a long way in making this more drinkable . secondly , i feel that i 've have many sublime sixpacks of this beer , and many that were just so so . consistency would be greatly appreciated , but as it lays , this is a solid beer worth picking up ."

S'one winter seasonal that i have probably seen the most improvement over the years is winterhook . its been around since 1985 in one form or another but seems to be on the stable path for several years now . bright clarity off of the deep copper color brew , awesome looking lacing as it leaves a web like trail down the glass . malty aroma of toasted grain and caramel , hint of floral and grassy hops as well . the smoothness is certainly there with a small crispness that drops off quick in the medium body . spicy , herbal and bit time floral hop flavor don a balanced bitterness that lingers far into the drying finish . high in drinkability , flavorful and a bit complex yet approachable enough to bring to a holiday party . by far its one of my favorites each year .'

S"ordered a bottle at the farmhouse in emmaus . paired with a bowl of pei mussels in bacon and a balsamic vinaigrette . pours a hazy gold with a white head that leaves lacing . while this beer expertly hides it 's 10 % alcohol , it 's a touch sweet , but i suppose that 's to be expected . the flavor and aroma focus mildly funky apple , orange , and berry fruit flavors with a spicy hint of hops at the end . personally i like my tripels a little spicier and drier , but this is an excellent beer that will put you in a ditch if you 're not careful ."

S"i 'm something of german/czech lager-freak , seeing as how good examples of it , to my palate at least , seem rare in the ipa-overwhelmed american craft-brew world . sam adam 's noble pils is a notable exception ( equal or better than anything i 've had in germany or czech ) but your typical attempt is either too hoppy ... or not enough ( macro-brews ) or with the less-than-bread-like-tasting malt found in german ( or czech ) pilsners over there ... .which are also very different in the same brands ... .over here . any german will tell you that the german beers we have in the usa just do n't taste the same as they do in the old country -- it may be due to age , or , different formuli ... who knows ( or cares ) ? still finding an american craft beer that has the subtle qualities of a true continental pilsner is quite rare , but , this is one of them . pours a nice straw yellow , normal for pilsner , with a typical head -- not quite as frothy as normal german beers , but good . head retention though is kinda poor , sn should work on that detail . aroma is nothing special ... no sulfer , but , no pronounced hops either . sam 's noble has it all over this beer here . taste is clean , crisp , and entirely well ballanced . i 'm so glad that sierra has discovered ballance in beer ... as hops are not the only important element . delicate beers like pilsners are supposed to be delicately hopped ... and this one is . it 's a perfect balance between the light bready grain ( no , there 's no corn here ) and the delicate noble hops . finish is very clean and palate cleansing . very much a session beer , which can be enjoyed by anyone . mouthfeel is just right for this style , not too heavy or watery . leaves you with just a faint trace of hops..adding to the serious drinkability . eminently drinkable ! ! !"

S"this beer is a restrained , not overly complex but characterful and very good beer , far better than their blond . it is an excellent example of a good , light , malty easy-drinking traditional scottish ale . copper amber , it has a smallish off-white head soon thinning to a foamy ring and with a little weak lace . aroma is toasty grain , dusty wood , hints of caramelised grain , dry leaves - very strong , hint of orange marmalade . taste is good , light but characterful and firm . it has lightly toasty grain and bread crust , light butterscotch , light leafiness , hints of peppery spice and mineral . it is dryish with finish that is sweeter with light leafy-toasty-peppery bitterness . feel is a bit thin but pretty good , flavour is well-rounded with some light complexity and somewhat reminds me of mactarnahan 's amber ale . it is overall very good and highly drinkable ."

S"okay i know what i have here in my hand . i am only doing this review because this is the first beer that i tried as a lad and i remember it being something i used to enjoy . then the transformation happened i moved up to regular bud and then from there to imports and then again to craft . this beer will always have good memories attached to it even if it does suck , that being said that if i had to pick an american macro now it would be pbr . i also found a bottle of miller lite that i am going to review side by side with this one . so heres we goes . appearance- piss yellow with a starch white head that fades into a slick . very minimal spotty lacing . smell- i was never the type to smell my beer before i became a ba so i never smelled bud-light before . it has this slightly skunky sickly sweet character to it . i ca n't make out any hop aroma here . it is also pretty grainy but nothing else stands out . taste- there is n't much to speak of here . it has a kind of grainy of biscuity taste with a slight malt taste . nothing that stands out but nothing offensive either . it is clean and i guess refreshing . mouthfeel- watery and carbonated that is about all i can say . drikability- i have been known to take down a twelve pack of these pretty easily . that is the only redeaming quality here well that and they are pretty cheap . they do n't fill you up so you can keep on pounding them . which my beer pounding days are over any way . overall- it makes me a little nastalgic sometimes about the time i spent with this beer but it is n't anything special . i ca n't believe i actually used to like this stuff . i mean it is n't the absolute most horrendouse beer i have had but if i had to order the macro lights it would be probably on top of busch light , miller lite , and coors light . i know it is hard to compare beers that are almost identical but there are a few subtle things i like about this one compared to the other clones ."

S"served at the publick house in a `` modified collins glass '' -- shorter and wider than a normal collins glass . the beer was a medium brown with nice clarity . it arrived with minimal head . it did n't have much in the aroma dept . it was slightly malty-smelling . i could n't discern any hops or caramel . i could taste slight peatiness and moderate maltiness with slight alcohol in the end . the beer had good balance in that no one thing stood out . it blended all the appropriate scotch ale flavors nicely . the beer is dangerous in that it does n't taste as strong as it is . mouthfeel was great for the style ... you know it 's there but it 's not too thick or too strongly carbonated . this was a very drinkable beer . i could drink gallons of this . it could be a session scotch ale ."

S"when gramps speaks of `` real beer '' , this is what we means . no , not westy . nor stone . not even sierra nevada . he 's talking about schell dark . now shuttup and listen . this is american lager done right . `` dark '' might be an overstatement . more of a golden copper . obligatory , fizzy white cap . nose is grainy . maybe with a touch of corn . gramps tells you to stop your highfallutin ' bullshit . this smells like beer . 'nuff said . begins lightly sweet . faint caramel notes , probably ( though not certainly ) adjuncted with corn . it does n't develop much from here . grainy midesection . hopping is light but drying , especially in combonation with the carbonation ( which , to its credit , does not seemed forced ) . simple stuff . but it works . find your complexities elsewhere , and just drink . light bodied and totally guzzleable . as a regional/macro , it is positively top shelf . this features a solid malt statement . embrace that . i received this as part of a schell sampler pack , which defeats its very purpose . this should not be sold in denominations less than 12 ( or , more likely , 24 ) . if this was readily available and cheap , it 'd be a staple in my fridge . and gramps would be proud of me ."

S"bottled in april of 2007 - batch 3 poured from a 12oz bottle into a dfh signature pint glass : appearance : pours a dark mahogany in color , huge billowing head sits atop this monster of a brew . lacing and retention are above average with the lacing staying thick and soapy on the glass . smell : aged chocolate cherries here , very potent to say the least . lots of esters popping out all over the place with a huge alcohol whiff . small amounts of oak can be smelled but overpowered big time by the alcohol aromas . taste : wow , i get bits of oak alot here now , chocolate is still present but now as much as in the aroma . woody elements , combined again with those cherries are very strong . maltiness is thick and sweet , with bits of grain , syrup , and oats . the finish consits of a strong amount of dark fruit , spiciness from the malt , and a huge dose of some alcohol . very different yet very enticing . mouthfeel : very syrup like , thick on the tongue with lower carbonation . this one is very big bodied on the tongue from the malt yet it 's smooth and very reserved . drinkability : what drinkability ? there is none . this is a slow sipper that will kick you in the pants from beginning to end . i love how the oak elements really pop out of this after tasting it , it almost makes the aroma deceiving , since i got alot of cherries & chocolate in here . overall these avery beers are standout brews , although i liked the grand cru & mephistopheles a bit better , this is one of the better barleywines i 've had in quite some time . take caution with this one , it 's smooth and not too hard to drink but this one will catch up to you quickly . highly recommended !"

S"appearance - 3.0 poured two fingers of foamy white head with lots of suspended sediment in the cloudy amber-beige body . smell - 3.0 quite a soft aroma , sweetish with an apple juice like fruitiness and not much in the way of malt . taste - 2.0 this is a beer that to me suffers from the `` coopers syndrome '' of having far too much yeast . crisp with bready pale malt , red apple and moderate bitterness . the yeastiness is if anything , stronger than the hop bitterness , which is completely wrong for an ipa , and gives a detergent-like taste and astringency . mouthfeel - 3.0 possibly a little over-fizzy . drinkability - 1.5 the more i have of this beer , the less i want to take another sip . overall - 2.45 after the very competent hightail ale , this beer is a great disappointment . it is sad to see another australian ale spoiled by an overly yeasty character . i 'm not sure if aussie micro brewers do it to make their beers more `` coopers-like '' , but i sure as hell do n't like it ."

S"you know your life is good when sierra is on tap as standard ! ! this is a great example of a well-done american pale ale . as an englishman , my compatriots tend to be critical of american brews , usually along the lines of `` too cold , too fizzy , too strong '' . crisp flavor and fresh smell work well with the carbonation and lower serving temperature . sure , it 's a little stronger than your typical english ale , but i keep coming back to this beer , summer or winter , whether i am in the mood for a refresher or a warmer , snpa always works ! ! !"

S"another barbeque special sampling , this time from a 12oz can . golden and clear with lots of rising bubbles and a fizzy , soda-like head , minimal lacing . grassy and grainy smelling , perhaps slightly fermented yeasty as well , a bit odd but not bad . tastes slightly sweet , with ample corny adjunctness , grainy . light and watery , slightly slick , sweet aftertaste . overall for an american adjunct lager , it 's decent but otherwise unimpressive . needs some oomph that it 's sorely lacking to make it anything i 'd buy on its own merit ."

S"drank from a 1 pt . 9.4 fl . oz . caged and corked bottle at max 's oyster bar , west hartford , ct poured a hazy , pale straw yellow with a three-finger , rocky , white head that quickly faded to a ring of lace . the aroma was sweet , yeasty and quite fragrant . a belgian yeast strain was immediately recognizable along with belgian candi sugar , bubble gum , an herbal spiciness and a touch of citrus . the taste was every bit as rich and pleasant as the aroma . lemon came through strong up front along with some creamy maltiness . a powdery yeastiness was noticeable mid-palate along with spices ( including coriander ) , a juicy fruitiness and a touch of herbal hops . the lemony sourness once again appeared on the back end , with the herbal hops and spices making their presence known on the finish . the aftertaste was a mix of sweet candi sugar and lemony sourness . the mouthfeel was super light and fluffy with a lively carbonation . the beer was actually a bit too airy and frothy on the palate . this did however make for outstanding drinkability . i can not remember the last time i had a beer that was so light yet so full flavored . additionally , the 9 % abv was remarkably well hidden . overall , this beer is a terrific example of belgian strong pale ale ( though many consider it a saison ) . i would highly recommend pairing it with a goat cheese salad or a lighter style fish dish ."

S'pours a medium orange/rootbeer color with a smallish white head . appears to have good carbonation . smell : sweet , toasty , caramel , floral ... interesting combo similar taste- quite sweet and fairly thick ... a pinch of hops in back but not obvious . good carbonation . a little too tangy/rich for me to drink in quantity , though i can enjoy one bottle .'

S'dark mahogany pour with a tiny bubbly head that quickly forms a ring around the glass . spotty lacing ... .not much to look at in the glass really . sour cherries waft up into my nose upon first smell . some earthy yeast and woody tones pop in along with a vinous quality and dark fruits . quite lovely . sweet and sour cherry notes fight back and forth against one another in sublime fashion . woody background that leaves a dry finish on the way down . earty yeast twang works its way in and out of each sip . fruity and vinous ... slightly acidic with a hint of cocoa . a very enjoyable experience . mouthfeel is rather thin and crisp . rolls over the palate nicely with good carbonation . this 8.4oz bottle is a tease ... i could easily go for a 750 of this stuff . incredibly drinkable and tasty . i will be seeking this one out again . recommended .'

S'sampled at hollingshead in orange last night before going to see i am legend at the cheap theater in the mall down the street , had to kill some time and this is always a great place and way to do it a-golden yellow with orange highlights , rather murky and looks unfiltered , small 1/4 inch creamy white head , not much retention or lacing s-lots of wheat , strong honey scent , lemons , bananas , orange peel , cloves , coriander , bready malt , and funk t-taste was a little too similar to pyramid or something to me , wheat in the beginning with some citrus flavors , then some bread in the aftertaste , did not change much once it warmed , got a little sweeter and had more orange tastes but that is about it , not too exciting but decent m-chewy and faintly dry mouthfeel , medium body , maybe a little too much carbonation , grainy feel that was watery at times d-could drink a good amount of these , light on the stomach , only five percent , smooth and easy going down , would make a nice session beer or summer refreshment first beer from this brewery , had not even heard of it before , saw that their bottles which were available here had paper labels , only thing i had not tried yet on tap last night , so i gave it a taste , probably would not drink again , recommended for a try though'

S"kozel ! this takes me back to praha : where the women are stunning and beer is cheaper than soft drink ! makes me wonder why i ever left ... anyway , enough reminiscing , this lovely pilsener was poured from a 500ml bottle into a 500ml stein . a : 2cm head dissipates to a half cm froth ( remarkable as few beers actually retain their head like this ) . the head itself is a pleasing bone white , whilst the body is a nice amber . s : cut grass , with a malty tone thanks to the crystal malts . not much else to say - if you want a classic pilsener go to the czech republic - they invented the style and they make enough of it to sate a population of beer drinkers ( largest per capita beer drinkers in the world and you can see why ) . t : sweet , more so than most beers of this style , with citrus overtones and a nice sharp bitterness ( from the saaz hops ) in the finish - classic pilsener flavours here . the malts also dominate , but in a good way . m : fairly carbonated , but again completely within the boundaries of the style . not watery , but not sticky either - this is a well balanced beer with a slightly dry aftertastes . d : yes please ! i can ( and did ) drink quite a few of these , there 's nothing to really fault for this beer and it ranks among the favourites i had in the czech republic ( along with staropramen , kruovice and the mighty krakonos ! ) . food match : czech food always goes well - roasted pork , dumplings , paprika , goulash and pickles ... closer to home ; thai or indonesian cuisine is my pick ."

S'nice and dark brown with a large light tan head of small bubbles . aroma is clean with notes of raison . tastes sweet with raisons , brown sugar , chocolate and some roasted malts . i realized after opening this one that it contains some kind of syrup ( invertzuckersirup ) . i guess its not awful , but just way too sweet . mouthfeel is medium-bodied , good carbonation , fairly normal . cloying sweetness , ended up pouring the rest out after 250ml . seems like the actual beer in here is not so bad , but i would avoid this unless you like syrup with your beer .'

S"served in a sniffer . the beer is a clear golden copper , effervescent , with a slightly tan head . the head thins to a film and leaves a tiny bit of lacing . the immediate aromas out of the bottle and initial pour were strongly pear and strawberry , backed with that signature brett funkiness . flavor is tart and fruity at first , again leading into the bret funk . the bret character is n't as in your face as some other wild ales . the bret brings some grassy and earthy flavors to the mix . the mouthfeel dries up quickly leaving you wanting more . the drinkability seems good after the first glass , but bret usually wears on me pretty quickly . overall this is the most enjoyable wild ale i 've had ."

S'although this brew is overall just a bit watery , it is fairly balanced and drinkable , plus , the ginger character is nicely done through out . a touch of ginger spice and flavor mixes well with mellow hop bitterness and subdued malt sweetness . towards mid sip the spice of the ginger mellows and a nice ginger flavor comes through a bit better . mild ginger candy flavor and soft grainy malt in the finish . like i said , its lacks some flavor , but all the flavors mix well and lend some brightness to the palate . unlike some many beers like this , the ginger isnt overdone . recommended , but dont expect to be blown away .'

S'slightly hazy , pale gold body sports a finger and a half of head on a hard pour . head fades quickly to leave only spotty lacing . smells almost like an american wheat beer : lemony tang , grain husks and soft pepper all stand out . a sour quality prevails throughout the consumption of the beer . a touch biscuit-y at first and then a bit of cereal mash on the finish . water is detectable and creates a clean finish . carbonation is overdone , a real surprise given the lack of a long-lasting head . however , as i continue to drink the beer my enjoyment never wanes . a flawed but highly drinkable brew . one i would have no trouble ordering in the future .'

S"i realize that seemingly , glbc can do no wrong and that their ofest is very popular on this site . however , i feel that its probably their weakest offering from an otherwise top 10 brewery . color is a dark caramel with shortlived head and minimal lace rentention . i cant see this mother birthing a monster head baby in a 1 liter ma . but , being of the american variety , one should n't expect that as the same could be said about victory , penn , etc . however , it 'd be nice to see . aroma is nothing but overpowering sweet candy malts . its a malt monster alright . flavor is full of chewy thick malts . lots of caramel going on too . no balance what so ever and too sweet to consume in copious amounts . its just too one sided and filling . knock back the malt content some and through in some more tettering or hallertaus to strike some sort of balance and this beer would improve drastically ."

'' i 've always enjoyed miller lite for its easy drinking ability so i 'm a little bias . it is my favorite lite beer . it 's a beer to drink in mass amounts because you ca n't have just one . it 's certainly not a beer that 's complex by any means ; it just has a simple taste . if it had anymore taste complexity , it would n't be a lite beer ."

S"a - light golden/orange body , with loads of smaller bubbles and a foamy off-white head . decent head retention and good lacing . s - very distinctive hoppiness in the nose , with strong pine-like and citrus notes . some malts start coming through . very powerful overall ! t - a massive hop bite right away ! the taste starts opening up with loads of fruitiness and pine notes . follows through into some sweetness and a bit of grain , then bringing some biscuit-type maltiness to the palate . the finish is super dry and quite bitter , which is not very noticeable until it warms up a little . m - very light and pleasant at first , the mouthfeel starts becoming a tad rough , courtesy of the finish . d - leaves me wishing for better . as it warmed up , the finish started really getting in the way of the overall merriness . if you are n't a true hop-head ( and i am not ) , chances are , this is n't a super drinkable beer for you , despite its great taste and complexity . i should take in account that i drunk a bomber bottle ; perhaps , if i had a small one , the drinkability would seem better ."

S"twelve ounce bottle from the longshot mix pack with a drink before september suggestion . poured into a pint glass . i 've enjoyed a few saison 's now and one thing i have noticed is that they all have this same white billowy head on top . the liquid itself is the nice yellow straw color that i associate with a refreshing saison but i do enjoy the look of a cloudy saison . this one is clear as can be . the cloudiness of an unfiltered yeasty saison just looks a little more `` authentic '' this looks processed and for that reason i give it a 2.5 for appearance . the good lacing keep it from being a 2.0 . the aroma gave me more hope for this `` longshot '' . big lemon is coming out of the nose on this one along with some nice spicieness presumably from the pepper . there 's dfinetely some wild yeast there as well along with some soured bread dough . its a nice pleasant smell but not a heavy hitter in the saison world by any means . the taste is over-powering lemon zest at the front of the palate , followed by some pilsner malt , and light hops . the pepper is lost at this point but seems to work in the aroma . this is very refreshing and could be one of those `` gateway beers '' for introducing bmc drinkers to craft ... or at least craft drinkers to saison . mouthfeel seems thin and thirst quenching like a saison should be but gone is the chewier feel from saisons with big yeast clouds present . it 's just a little underwhelming . drinkability is good . if i have to pick a summer beer to be had with a hot dog , this would beat out bmc and heineken any day . over all i gave this a low score . keep in mind that i am grading it against better saisons i have had and not necessarily to every beer i have ever had . that said , i would drink this beer again and maybe even buy it . it is nice to see a saison from america 's biggest brewery and in a twelve ounce bottle for that matter . for one of my favorite styles the value of this beer was exceptional . i would reccomend it for someone just getting into the style but grab a bomber of victory helios to compare it against . you 'll see the differences i speak of ."

S"i thought about what i was going to say about this beer for quite a while before i finally decided on this review . i love the beer . in fact , i was tempted to only drink this beer the night i was at the addison flying saucer . but alas , a wide selection makes you turn to other great beers . how horrible ! anyway , the one thing that made me most confused about how i would review this beer is the fact that the oaktoberfest is sweet ... i mean really sweet . i can see this beer being way too sweet for some beer drinkers and definitely for lovers of oktoberfest beers . the beer pours a pretty amber with an orange hue . my pour had very little head but that could be a bad pour by the scantily clad bar wench . the aroma was so lovely , fruity and sweet with a faint floral that hinted that hops were in there somewhere . ok , i 've already mentioned the sweetness . and i also have noted that i love the flavor . but this is one of the sweetest oktoberfests i have ever had . it seems to be a bit unbalanced , and i hate to say that since i loved it so . all in all , this is a wonderful beer . but i would have to say as an oktoberfest is is not as good as the saint arnold , for you texas drinkers . last word ... delicious ."

S'remarkably obsidian black and perhaps perfectly opaque . an odd mix of ultrafine and very large bubbles float atop the darkness in a fairly sturdy beige-ivory head . the nose is full of smoke ( obviously ) , but it comes through in unpleasant ways , like plastic , burning tires , band-aids , or hospital equipment . however , there is also a more enticing , meatier side to the smoke , reminiscent of burnt wood and ( naturally ) peat . underlying notes of vanilla and toffee and fruit are all but decimated by the barrel . the flavor is similar to the aroma , but weirdly simplified ; sweet and smoky with virtually no nuance to speak of . my tongue searches for subtlety and turns up nothing - basically , this is nondescript , somewhat rum-raisiny sweetness inelegantly wed to nondescript , smoky scotch . i wonder if these two strong , ordinarily complex flavors destroyed each other . on the palate it is quite full , oily , and chewy , which creates a sort of illusion of richness even though the flavor is rather weak . dry finish . overall , this is not very good . i may have to use it as a marinade .'

S"12oz bottle purchased as part of a mixed 12 pack . pours a nearly opaque body with a short-lived half inch of light tan head . cocoa is the most noticeable part of the aroma with not much else going on . cocoa characterizes the flavor as well , with just the slightest touches of molasses and caramel . on the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation . an easy drinker with nothing offensive about it . extremely pedestrian in almost every way . just barely a 'starter porter ' . i think i 'd have liked it much better in the days i was in love with guinness draught , which the flavor is fairly similar to ( perhaps a bit better than ) . having said that , the flavors that are there are pleasing and there really is n't anything offensive about this beer ."

S'new 22 oz bottle with a pretty , rustic label . poured into a snifter . pours a radiant , hazed orange amber with a large frothy white head that has good retention and light lacing . aroma is interesting and pleasant , a blend of sweet tropical fruits and sugars with a musty , earthy belgian yeast and estery typical saison base . body is odd , medium thick and slightly juicy with very active , fine carbonation . finish is dry and earthy , very refreshing with an undertone of sweetness . but the flavor ... oh the flavor , what happened to this . hiding in here is a pleasant , earthy saison , but this is so ridiculously over the top sugary and sweet its very difficult for me to continue drinking this . it almost feels like there is a layer of canned peach juice floating on top of an exceptionally earthy and dirty saison in both flavor and body . ugh , this could have been a very unique , enjoyable saison but the balance before sweet and dry earthy is non-existent in addition to way too much artificial sugar sweetness .'

S"i did n't really know what to expect from an imperial octoberfest , but as i poured this beer i became excited . i really like this beer 's appearance . it has a lovely reddish amber color . clear with a slightly amber creamy head . after pouring i took a whiff . to be perfectly honest i did n't really get much out of the smell . a little bit of strawberris and maybe some apple . the amount of alcohol that i smelled told me that this was going to be a strong one . the first taste was surprising . i guess i should have taken the 'imperial ' part more seriously , but the strength of this beer was a bit of a shock . i felt like i was tasting a barley wine . this is not a beer to be gulped . it is sweet and alcoholic . there is some maltiness in there , but not as much as i would expect out of an octoberfest . i 'm not a huge fan of this beer . its pretty well executed , maybe i 'm just not a fan of the style . do n't get me wrong . i like a strong beer . but , given the way this beer tastes , i would rather just drink a good barley wine ."

S"as much as like this brewery , i did n't really like this specific beer . it 's quite strong , and the alcohol content is n't that high , but is n't well hidden . it forms a nice head , that lasts for a decent amount of time , and the color is nice , redish/ambar . i could really taste the smoked malt , and i did n't really like it . not a bad beer , it just does n't fit my personal taste ."

S"a : deep crimson with a quickly fading off but persistent white head . gorgeous ! s : nutty with hops . t : good . quite hoppy but low on overall flavor . not quite as bold as it should i feel it should be . hops flavor going down with a nice bitterness in the after taste . m : leaves the mouth a bit dry , but quite soft . d : excellent ! light enough to go down easy even after a few . overall : the appearance is amazing ! the deep crimson color is really beautiful . smell is good , taste is pleasant , and it goes down easy . i 've lived in wisconsin my whole life but this is my first go at 1888 bock . i was extremely surprised with it and would recommend it to any one . truly a fantastic beer , despite what the other reviewers have said !"

S"pours a hazey golden in color , with an off-white , slightly rocky head . musty/yeasty malt aroma features a citric-hop character , a hint of vanilla and pineapple , and more yeast . . .reminds me of a homebrewed version we used to make in college . sharp and slightly tangy at the outset , fading in increments to a mellow-sweet malty backbone with intermittent surges of piney/resiny hops . excellent lingering bitterness . a touch of lactic sourness works for the style . alcohol is well-integrated , and bitter/crisp hop qualities are well-balanced . too hoppy for an `` apa '' but not too hoppy to be a west coast hop-bomb . smoother and less fruit-forward than the legendary two hearted , this reminds me of alan sprint 's `` ruth '' the more i drink it , and that *is* a good thing ! ladies and gentlemen , rush river is indeed the next big thing in the midwest regional brewing community , and elvis has left the stage . . ."

S'diet beer tastes like diet beer . lack of color to match the lack of taste . it does have alot of carbonation combined with the lack of flavor combine well on a hot day to be a better alternative to selzer wtaer to quench your thirst . not a good beer , but not totally bad either .'

S"poured from a nitro can into a pint glass . as with most nitro cans , great head , and as always , watching a guinness poured right settle is pretty satisfying . the usual guinness metallic taste , not a really strong smell or anything . nothing too overpowering , this remains an extremely drinkable stout . much better compared to that guinness draft bottle junk that 's supposed to be drank out of the bottle . to me , the exceptional part of the guinness is the appearance , and you miss that with the bottle . better from the can ."

S"i 've had this beer several times before out of the bottle and loved it , but off the tap is a different story . had it at tapwerks in oklahoma city . a - good . it looks the same as out of the bottle . i do n't see the point in elaborating since if you 're reading this you probably know what it looks like out of the bottle . s - this was a huge , bad difference . very strong phenolic smell that other reviewers are calling 'rasin cola ' that i could n't place . i gave it to my friend with quite a sensitive sniffer who hit it dead on - urinal cake . blegggh . yuck ! ptooey . gross . well that ruined it for me . yeah , this beer really needs time to age . why ca n't they let the kegs age too before shipping them out ? oh well , too bad for them ... they are wasting all their hard work ! i will only take this beer in the bottle from now on . t - the actual taste was good . tastes like it does out of the bottle . maybe a bit *fresher* but for this kind of beer that 's not better , just different . depends on what you like . m - similar to out of the bottle but the carbination was a lot mellower . meh . has that same weird texture that manages to be both thin and syrupy at the same time as other heavy belgians . d - i finished the glass no problems , putting the thoughts of urinal cakes out of my mind . it 's still a good beer , just give it time to grow up guys ! it 's a stinky child ."

S"the pour was an extremely murky dark brown with a solid inch of creamy head that quickly dissipated to a heavy lace over the top that retained throughout the drink . the smell was pungent and very malty , with a whiff of alcohol , and raisins and figs at the back of the nose . the taste was mostly malty with a little bit of spice , with a nice hop bite with raisin undertones at the end . it was very thick and creamy , and at the same time well carbonated . i found it to be a very rich and enjoyable beer . would n't make a very good session beer , but definately very tasty ."

S'odd i recall black hearted to be..black ? i suppose i was just expecting the trend of black ipas . pours a copper and straw color , strong density with a tall white head , leaving lacing all over . there is a very clear funky , earthy english hop profile here so the style seems legit ( darn ) . that said theres a strong american something here i like . the beer opens with intense assault on the front of the tongue where the hops simply dominate and nothing else is heard . from there the hops subside and the malt dominates just as intensely leaving a caramel malt sugary sweetness from the middle to the back of the mouth . balance is perfectly flawed on both sides ! ok after reading the comments on the bottle the malt makes more sense . the toast and oak are what makes this malt so intense and effective . huge props for this usage ! not sure how english they are.. the carbonation is perfectly creamy and interesting , the malty back is thick and nearing the syrupy stage . im digging this . 12 dollars for a bomber ? 12 freaking dollars for a beer that must be consumed fresh , doesnt age , and isnt as good as dreadnaught ? im sorry but i live with your insane prices guys , but this one is beyond out of wack ! that said if you see it on tap for a reasonable price , it is amazing beer and one to seek out . i saw a man buy old foghorn for 25+ today for a 6er . i really wanted to ask how he could justify that for a 6er of ok beer . the thing is this beer is 39 for a 6er equivalent and well i cant even begin to accept that for this really really good beer .'

S"appearance : a dark crimson shade that was hard for me to focus in on , the lights were darker than usual ... anyway , it was n't quite opaque but almost , with a frothy head that held it 's own nicely . smell : toasted walnuts , hops were fruity and the alcohol finish was light , with a tiny bit of that corky , aged aroma that was subdued enough to be quite pleasing . taste : my first sip surprised me with it 's silken , lacy smoothness , the carbonation almost absent . a very mellow sherry/madeirized flavor that mingles well with the solid chunk of caramel malt and pretty much cancels out any lingering alcoholic vapors or unpleasant tannins . bitterness is almost inexistent , the finish is delightfully sweet yet not cloying at all , it was a pleasure to drink from start to finish . this beer really hit all the right buttons for me . nicolas , the brewmaster , procrastinated for months before releasing it ( 9 to be exact ) , but it was sure worth it , kudos to him ."

S'pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a thin tan head , and leaves nice lacing . the aroma consists of overwhelming bourbon notes , along with some caramel and brown sugar , dark fruit notes , piney and citrusy hops and a big whiff of alcohol . the flavor is also dominated by bourbon notes , with some caramel and toffee and brown sugar , along with piney hops , dark fruits and alcohol . the mouthfeel is thick and drinkability is pretty limited . really this just tastes like a slightly toned down bourbon , and the alcohol overwhelms anything else going on in the beer .'

S"bought it specifically out of wonderment that lone star beer actually exists - i thought it was made up . very light gold color - looks like miller lite , which probably is n't too surprising . poured from bottle into a glass , it foams up to about a 2 inch head , which fizzes down to a thin white foam over about a minute . not much smell to speak of . tastes like you 'd expect from a standard american lager but it has a slightly hoppy aftertaste on the back of the tongue that makes it stand out a little bit from the crowd . not spectacular , but pretty good for the style . certainly inoffensive . i could potentially buy it again as a barbecue beer . edited to increase drinkability score . this stuff does go down like water ."

S"had this on tap at max 's the other night . the beer pours a solid gold color with nice head retention and adequate lacing . i do n't get a lot on the nose , which seems pretty subdued . i get just a trace of ginger and bitterness , but one thing that is very apparent is the abv . i know it 's 10 % , which is up there , but the alcohol on the nose is really apparent in this beer . on the palate the abv . is even more noticeable and just dominates the beer . i get some flavors of apple and burnt sugar as well , but this beer has no where near enough hops or malt to carry this amount of alcohol . the beer tastes heavy and the finish is miserable . this beer is no fun to drink and i ultimately told the bar tender i could n't finish it . a couple of thoughts . first , i have nothing against high abv . beers , and in fact am a big fan of imperial stouts , dipa 's and most belgian strong ales . whoever added this beer to the data base indicated it was a dipa , which was clearly a mistake . yes , it has the alcohol of a dipa , but the label ( not to mention the beer list at max 's ) indicates this is an extra pale ale . st 's unearthly dipa has the hops and malt to handle the high abv. , but this beer clearly does not . the folks at st need to understand , i believe , that just because a beer has a high abv . does not make it a great beer . obviously , st knows how to make good beer ( ipa , unearthly and their trippel , to name just a few ) . but imo this is not one of their better efforts ."

S"2005 app : poured a nice maroon/red ( brown ) wine color with no head , little carbonation and no lacing ... well the color was nice ... and it is a couple years old ... smell : complex malts similar to old barley wines . molasses and brown sugar are strong , so is the caramel . it reminds me of brandy . taste : buttery caramel toffee with alcohol , and again the brown sugar . it 's a very intense taste that forces one to sip . mouthfeel : smooth on the sip , but the alcohol roughens it up a bit . there is no bitterness ... none . drinkable : it 's hard to work through a glass because of the alcohol , but i 'd gladly split a bottle with a friend . it 's similar to brandy , and that 's not my favorite ... but it still tastes better than any brandy i 've had ."

S"requires a careful pour . carefully decanted , pours out to a semi-cloudy/chill-hazed medium golden with orange accents , forming a large white head with excellent retention and solid sheets of lacing . carbonation is strong . head texture is soapy . aroma..begins lightly skunked , then peculiar notes of melting rubber , green apples , mandarin oranges , cloves , honey , a fair amount of pale malt husk ... very nice nose . mouthfeel is spritzy with a bubbly sting lingering on the palate ... deceptive medium-light body . taste starts out very spicy ... lots of cloves and phenols with a bunch of fruity esters ... midway there is a rubbery and odd saccharin bitterness , a tinge of melted rubbers , and then a burning , peppery booze effect towards the finish . the alcohol is mildly caustic , detracting from the brew . somewhat unusual for a triple ... most are not this alcoholic . it 's more of an isopropyl astringency and burn . finish is dry and peppery with a distinct isopropyl burn , woody with lingering saccharin and candi-sugar inflections . this is a decent brew with limitations , but overall , this beer just does n't taste natural . the alcohol is too forceful in it 's presence and upsets the balance of the beer . between this and the ruddy , saccharin finish , drinkability is limited . not worth the $ 3.49 i paid for the tiny 11.2oz bottle . best enjoyed warm when it 's had time to mellow ... the carbonation is a bit much at first ."

S"served at about 50 degrees f in pint glass , listening to fen- `` the malediction fields '' sprecher 's dopple bock is already the favorite brew of mine , by this home-town brewery . i thought it was about time that i picked some more up again just for the sake of giving it a proper review though . that is when i went to woodman 's and saw this limited edition version of it ( they also had a scotch ale ) . needless to say , i was rather disappointed . the pour created an almost 1 inch very tan head , but quickly shrank to a thin layer ( and eventually nothing ) after a few minutes . the color was a deep brown , borderline black , significantly radiating a red hue when tilted and/or held up to light . the smell was pretty subtle , almost thin , and smelled greatly of bourbon mixed with those chocolaty malts . it seemed pretty inviting , but at first taste ... wooooah : bourbon . and it slightly builds towards the finish . i at least gave this brew a decent rate in the taste category because it is what is . if you like hard liquor , i can see how you would enjoy this . i however , do not . i was looking for the familiar roasted and very dark chocolate flavors , but it seems to be drowned out by all that bourbon on my particular pallet . different strokes for different folks , i guess . however , it must be emphasized that there is n't much else going on here . it was medium-bodied , and quite sticky in the mouth . something i expected and enjoy . fairly smooth , and has a nicely balanced finish too . the drinkability is where this `` beer '' really takes it 's hit , in my humble opinion . first of all , it only comes in a wine-sized bottle , and you have to bring on a gnarly buzz in order to finish one . i am actually drunk now and have to piss like a garden hose . i normally would never introduce price as a factor in a review either , but one of these bottles set me back about $ 14 . basically , it means that even if this was a very delicious beer , it would still be all but physically impossible to give it a perfect rating in drinkability . and it 's anything but delicious ... all those hard liquor notes , you are pretty much better off just buying a bottle of bourbon , i think . this bottle will make a fine piece in my collection , but i still recommend just buying sprecher 's regular dopple bock instead ."

S"poured into a pint glass . 5.0 a : hazy bottled-conditioned medium orange color . two fingers of incredibly creamy and dense off-white head with sickeningly wonderful retention and tons of sticky lacing . i ca n't find a reason not to give this a 5 . 3.5 s : citrusy and herbal hops with the most prominent aroma being grapefruit . neutral malt base . alright , but not really doing it for me . 3.5 t : nice balance between flavor and bittering hops . the bitterness is n't too harsh and complements mandarin orange and grapefruit hops . malts are again pretty neutral , with just a touch of crystal to balance . 4.5 m : lighter medium body , but actually quite creamy . good carbonation and smooth , with a pleasant bitter aftertaste . 3.0 d : not bad , but sort of boring . there are plenty of other low octane brews that keep my tastebuds better entertained ."

S"i had this on tap while eating lunch . i have not had a labatt blue in a long time so i figured why not give it a try . appearance - your typical golden yellow lager . the head was about an 1/8 '' thick and faded away after the first few drinks . it had some lightly flowing bubbles but outside of that it was n't anything exciting . smell - i could hardly smell anything , it had a light reminiscent smell of your typical macro lager but it was so weak on the smell i just could n't detect anything else . taste - this was n't a bad tasting but nothing great . i could detect some adjuncts and a very light malt taste . it just did n't have a lot of taste . mouthfeel - this felt somewhat watery to the palate and finished slightly dry . drinkability - this is easy enough to drink down since it really has no redeeming taste characteristics and goes down as easy as water . overall this was an ok lager to drink while eating chicken wings . i guess it served its purpose on this trip . i would n't write home over this beer but it would be a great beer for someone that doesnt really like the taste of beer . in my opinion this is rather boring ."

S'pale yellow and very clear with a lot of small bubbles that help keep a thin , white head on top of this beer . aroma consists of musty hops , dms ( cooked corn or veggies ) , a light grainy maltiness , and a hint of sulfur . taste is sharp initially , partly due to high carbonation , with just a bit of malt sweetness . as the carbonation subsides a harsh bitterness appears that gets stronger into the aftertaste . very light bodied and it produces an unpleasant dryness on the tongue over time . 330 ml can with freshness date stamped clearly on the bottom .'

S"on-tap at the south philly tap room , served in a pint glass a hazy golden body with streams of bubbles pushing north to a foamy white cap that had receded to a thin layer by the time it reached my table . clove hit me at first hard . it took me a while to push through . bready yeast , tangerine , hay , and pepper . almost has a medicinal aroma . refreshing and light . tangerines shine through a little more , with the clove quickly in tow . grass , hay and a strong bready yeast round out the flavors . light bodied with carbonation right on for the style . refreshing and crisp , with a dry , lightly bitter finish . i found this to be one of the easier drinking saisons i have had . the alcohol was barely noticeable . i could easily polish off multiple 750 's of this guy ."

S"reddish amber color , very cloudy due to a very large amount of yeast . the most identifiable aromas are yeast and malt , with metallic , floral , fruit and hop scents that are faint and conflicting . tastes very dry and astringent with an overwhelming amount of yeast , despite some still being caked in the bottom of the bottle . a lot of flavors conflict with each other , everything in the aroma is present to some degree , but they do not come together as a real flavor for the beer . feels like a mouthful of yeast , with an aftertaste similar to a bad dry champagne . while this is unfiltered and the yeast content is excessive , nothing else about the beer was impressive , or even average , and i do n't think it would be enjoyable had it been filtered . i had trouble finishing half of the 12oz bottle , it was unpleasant to drink and not enjoyable all around ."

S"ha , why have just one ! a mostly dark color with a definite brown hue throughout . a little bit light for style . a soft off white head with ok retention and lacing throughout . not much for lacing though . the nose is limited overall . some hints of malt but very limited . some minor astringent notes with a slight ash tray type of aroma . there is some minor yeast as well , but overall the aroma is not really there . the taste is light for a porter as well . sure the abv is low but minor malt notes with a light black roast taste the lingers into the finish . a bit watery overall . some ash tray notes that lingers . some minor diaceytl notes and a more noticeable yeast flavor as well . the body is really lacking . a bit wispy , even with the alcohol by volume , would like more depth and body . noticeable astringent notes that linger and leaves an acrid finish . overall it 's a boarder line a brown porter but a bit astringent for that style"

S"i 've had this many times , from a bottle , growler , and on tap . pliny pours a golden amber color , with the richest looking head i remember seeing . very creamy and robust , that is . not thin or quick to dissipate . lacing all the way down the pint glass . the smell is heavenly , what i imagine pure hop extract would smell like . citrusy , very floral , but not stinging . even my dad who does n't drink though it smelled good . the taste is of course also phenomenal . along with all the typical hop characteristics of resiny pineyness , citrus , and flowers , i notice for lack of a better word , a very rounded taste , almost reminiscent of cantaloupe or honeydew melon . despite being so heavily hopped , it is not bitter at all . there is no acrid taste here , and no malty sweetness , pure unbridled hops . the mouthfeel is nice . it is very luscious and rich . this is where the creamy head comes from . it coats the palate in the most velvety way , and has just the right amount of carbonation to round it out . drinkability is pretty good . this is my favorite d/ipa . period . i must say though that i would never want more than a pint at once . this is a great pleasure to drink but it is no session beer . when i first went to russian river , i wanted to try a barrel aged beer or the younger , but there were none of those to be found . a local said `` get the elder , you wo n't be disappointed ! '' well there began my love affair with pliny the elder , hands down my favorite hoppy beer i have tried ."

S"original review 5/27/03 raising the bar ( imo ) on what a perfect representation of the style ought to be . in all fairness , i almost need to go back through my reviews and adjust any other stout ratings using this beer as the standard . whew , what a sampling this turned out to be . pours a brownish-black with a mocha-brown head , very sticky creamy lace that ai n't goin ' nowhere ! the aroma nearly qualifies as tasting it , it 's that intense . sweet espresso , heavily roasted malts , you can smell that much without trying . the look and smell absolutely give away what you 're about to experience , no punches pulled . the taste is jurassic , nothing less . huge , bold , dark roasted malts and espresso , coated with a sweet syrupiness . the taste kind of evolves into a bitter chocolate and charcoal finish completely off the scale . the beer coats the mouth and is in no hurry to clear out . you can just sit and savor for a minute between each sip . high alcohol , for sure , but you wo n't need many of these to make it through the night . i split one of these 3 ways , if i have one just to myself it will take an hour or more , there 's just so much flavor , you dare not rush it and short circuit any taste along the way . thank you , kalamazoo ! *** aged another 2 1/2 years to see what happens ... appearance - pours an inky black with a trace of coca cola brown/red at the bottom edge of the glass . very thick dark mocha bubbles form up a half-finger or so cap , receding to a thin but solid cover . has n't lost a step . 5.0 aroma - the sweet roastiness , the syrupy coffee and espresso and bitter chocolate , what a great aroma . 5.0 taste - heavy , charred malts , sweetness and bitter espresso bean . a touch of soy somewhere from mid-palate to swallow , followed by much charcoal and some late hop bitterness . the end tries to regain a little of the sweetness but the bolder side has stepped it up through the rest period and does n't allow it to develop . some fleeting bittersweet chocolate as the flavors dissipate , which takes a bit . very late warming alcohol , often only felt down in the belly . perhaps experience has tempered my palate or my tastes are n't quite as impressed or maybe the beer 's best has waned , i do n't know . it 's not as memorable but for the smoky , burnt stout lovers out there , give this a shot after two to three years . 4.0 mouthfeel - incredibly thick , the carbonation has held up well . it"

S"chilled bottle into a glass . a generous gift from ramnuts . thanks , frank ! this beer had two things going for it : the bottle is essentially a 1l growler , and it 's waxed . i 'm in love . a : pours a clear amber with garnet tones in the glass . the beer is well-carbed , with a frothy 2 '' head filling my hair of the dog tulip . it retains surprisingly well , leaving thick , sticky lace down the sides of the glass as it goes . s : while it 's not the most pungent beer , i manage to pick up elements of orange pith , pine needles , and jasmine . at times the beer appears to exhale and surprise me with a sudden puff of fresh , vibrant citrus ; it actually reminds me of orange juice during these moments . t : it has the straightforward west coast ipa profile : orange pith , pine needles , and a slightly floral ( jasmine is what it reminds me of ) flavor . a small apricot taste , as well . the malt is mostly restrained ; it contributes a touch of caramel and some pale malt sweetness , but both have been largely fermented out . m : light-medium in viscosity , and lacking in body . the taste falls off very fast , resulting in a watery finish . very dissatisfying . as it warms , it firms up a little , but not by much . it also gets boozier , so that 's a wash. d : frank apologized in advance , as he tried the beer after it shipped but before it arrived . i assumed he was being overly harsh . i still think so , but not by a large margin ."

S"pours a cloudy golden orange color from the bottle with a half inch of soap bubble head that boils away after a couple minutes . first smell brought with it a hint of skunk , but after that i found a mix of tripel/belgian pale aromas -- orange , pear , grassiness , and a spicy pepper note . taste is similar to the smell , but tastier and with a nice alcohol presence . if the label did n't say otherwise , i would probably have classified this as a tripel . the finish contains apple flavors and mild hops . mouthfeel is a little spicy and there 's a tart bitterness to the finish . the alcohol suits the mouthfeel and flavors , and while it is a refreshing brew , the nearly 8 % abv does n't make this the most drinkable of beers . interestingly , i remember the hennepin i had on tap as a little fruitier . nevertheless , this is a great offering from ommegang , and i 'd think about returning to it again when i 'm in the mood for a belgian ."

S"i 'm drinking a 2006 bottle that i bought at the brewery when new and aged in my cellar . unfortunately i have most of the case left , because it is not aging well . the caps must not be attached well , because the beer is still . this is not the only bottle in the case to turn out flat , either . strange , because an earlier doggie claws -- 2003 -- was extremely bubbly , so much that the brewery sold cases at a hefty discount for several years afterward . it kept building up fizziness in the bottle . and it was a great beer ! champagne-like in its color and delicate flavor , once you waited for the head to die down . but there is no way to let the head `` die up '' on the newer one . it tasted good when fresh , but aging is supposed to benefit it . well ... .it 's a copper-colored , flat , sweet , strong drink . sort of like an off -- brand sherry . it might be good for cooking , except for all the hops . really a shame because i usually like this brewery and love this beer ."

S'this one was a bit of a gusher , as soon as i popped the cap the beer tried to foam over . the beer is a clear , deep amber color , and despite being well carbonated only forms a thin pale amber colored head . the aroma is a mix between sweet caramel , and intense fruity notes of prune and cherry and even perhaps a bit of sherry . the taste is somewhat malty , and has a weird lingering finish that seems a bit off . there are notes of sherry here as well as caramel , and a concentrated fruitiness that reminds me of prunes . this is pretty light on the palate and the one thing that really lingers is the sherry note .'

S'presentation : it was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass . appearance : the head builds up tall and has a creamy off white color . it quickly fades down to a thin ring of lace around the edge of the glass . this head sits on top of a golden honey colored body with very good clarity . smell : the aroma has a light grainy character with a lots of pumpkin pie spice mixed in . taste/mouth feel : it has a bit hit of spice throughout with cinnamon being most noticeable over other pumpkin pie spices . hop flavor seems neutral but it adds bitterness the cinnamon flavor . underneath there is a mildly sweet malty flavor with some mild pumpkin flavor . the finishes quickly and has a grainy alcohol quality to it . the body is light to medium with a thin , watery and slick feel . its carbonation is about average . notes : overall this is defiantly not a standout and its fairly heavy spicing can become a little bit overpowering , limiting drinkability to one or two 12oz bottles .'

S"a - this beer was on draft and i did n't get to see the pour , but it arrived a cloudy golden color with a nice persistent head . s - the aroma of this beer is hoppy ! it smells like a bag of fresh hops - outstanding aroma . t - bitter . hoppy and bitter . hops is about the only word to describe it ... .other than intense . m - medium to full bodied and slightly creamy . d - this beer is a bit one dimensional . it is very flavorful and intense , but perhaps a little too much to be considered an easy to drink brew . note : i had this again last night from a growler . it is a very impressive brew . it is intense , but perhaps not as one dimensional as i had originally thought . it is still a delightful challenge to drink ."

S"had it on tap , although not at the brewery . it appeared in the glass in front of me as a reddish liquid with a small amount of head . first sip was sort of neutral , it did n't really do anything for me . it was sort of flattish on the tongue with no real standout flavors/textures . a couple more sips and i started to enjoy the fact that it was extremely drinkable and leaning towards the slightly malty and fruity side . certainly a nice pint on a warm day and with spicy food due to its easy drinkability ."

S"not sure if this is a limited edition number or a new addition to the rogue lineup . pretty bottle has a red illustration of a chinook salmon , which goes nicely with the chinook hops inside the bottle . this may or may not go to benefit ecotrust , the environmental organization that coined the term `` salmon nation '' . pours a deep reddish amber with a small white head that struggles to build up to a half-inch before quickly receding to a thin halo . light aroma of sweet roasted caramel malt , light hops , and a touch of biscuit . palate begins with mellow caramel malt , with the ample hop presence emerging right before the swallow . early notes of biscuit and light fruit yield way to a subtle spruce character on the finish . body is smooth and creamy , but a little thin . very drinkable , and i do n't usually enjoy ambers very much . another quality offering from rogue ."

S'the kaiser pours a reddish amber with a decent light brown head that goes to a thin film and laces the glass . its aroma is toasted malt , some spicy hops and some vinous alcohol . the flavor is sweet ( a little too much so ) , slightly fruity , caramel malts initially , with some spicy hops . a strong acidic alcohol taste dominates through to the finish . it tastes a little medicinal - it reminds me a little of cherry nyquil . it is pretty full bodied and creamy . i wanted to like this . i like avery beers , but this one , like the beast , disappointed me . too much alcohol , too over the top .'

S"why did they pull this monster out of retirement ? especially at the expense of , what , staghorn ? one of the best domestic maerzens . maybe i 'm being too hard on it , it tastes like a 80/20 mix between their belgian red and their oud bruin . now , i did n't really like the belgian red but i loved the oud bruin , so the balance is towards me very much not liking this beer . but let 's break it down : it pours a hazy cherry read with a head that collapses into a ring around the beer . not lovin ' it . it smells , ahhh , like something nice and rotten . like the oud bruin mixed with some cherries . i was pretty excited while smelling it . it tastes , like sweet cherry juice . like i am drinking black cherry juice . as it warms there is some of the nice rankness of the wild fermentation . there is just too much of the former and too little of the latter . and it is way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way , way too sweet . it is an artesianal version of leinie 's berry weiss . ( original score , 1.5 ) . so , i let the beer sit until it was very near room temp . the funk has taken over a bit and it has gone from being actively bad to merely a letdown . mouthfeel : a little cloying , but not really bad . just mediocre . drinkability ? heck no . no desire to have this beer again ."

'' so i got a bottle to try . a : appropriate appearance . the deep brown but clear color is what you would expect from the crust of a loaf of banana bread . s : best feature of this bear . it smells precisely like banana bread . the smell was not overly strong or chemical . t : while the banana notes were good and the beer balanced , i found the taste too thin . the first few sips were a novelty , the next few were quite good . i lost interest in the last half the bottle however . m : thin . not enough malt backbone . d : i did not finish the entire bottle . the flavor profile of the banana-y-ness , yes that is a technical term , was spot on . in the end though the beer itself did n't hold up for me ."

S"three philosophers ( 2004 ) , on tap at the belgian room in nyc for an ommegang event . the appearance was stunning : a rich dark red color , almost syrupy , and a large but quickly fading head . it looked incredible in a large wine glass . that said , i found the aroma a little disappointing . it smelled primarily malty and sweet , but , i thought , deserved to be much more pronounced . when it came to drinking it , though , this beer did not disappoint at all . moderately thick and a little bubbly , it was a real pleasure to sip , and the taste was extremely complex ; with each sip i noticed another flavor . malty and sweet are followed by a slight yeasty taste and sour cherries , with a number of other flavors , spicy and roasted , that i could n't quite pick out . it tasted quite peaty and smokey throughout -- reminding me of scotch whisky . the alcohol was well masked at first but became increasingly ( and , i thought , surprisingly ) pronounced as the beer warmed . between the thickness and the strength and complexity of flavor , this really is best enjoyed slowly , in small amounts , and without food ; as much as i enjoyed it , i could only have one small glass in an evening . but i 'll happily have that one glass any opportunity i get ."

S"750 corked and caged bottle into flute attractive caramel brown body with a creamy light tan head and a touch of streaky lace . the scent is quite amazing . a blast of pungent and acidic sourness , vinous grapes , yeast , spice , toasty notes . the taste is just as overwhelming as the scent . sour , salty , wine grapes , yeast , oaky and toasted flavors . my unlettered palate ca n't help but taste apple cider vinegar . mouthfeel is intensely astringent and puckering . the back of my throat tingles and itches . drinkability is , at least for me , not high . i suspect that finding just the right food to accompany it might make it easier to drink . this is the james joyce of beers . its not for the casual quaffer and may leave you confused and upset at times but the experience makes you a richer human being . well , perhaps that 's stretching it but if you want a beer that is both shocking and enriching rodenbach grand cru is a good choice ."

S"this beer manages to walk a fine line . it is a complex style of beer , but it aims itself at a rather uncomplex audience . it is the sort of beer you 'd have with dinner and it would compliment anything without getting in the way . you would n't really think about it , just note that it is a pleasant accompaniment . the yeast kicks off some nice esters , mostly almond and peach , while the malt profile is a nice blend of nicely toasty vienna malts and sweet pilsner malts . while you are drinking it , the beer is incredibly enjoyable , but the experience is ephemeral because all too soon it is gone . the 750 does n't last long . plus , the 750 cost me 4.26 after tax . ca n't beat that ! a good beer for a fantastic price . i mean , let 's make no mistake , this is an ok at best biere de garde , but as a 'beer ' it offers enough complexity to keep me going with enough drinkability to keep me drinking . and the price ? i mean , sure , i could get a better beer if i broke into the $ 8 range and could get a substantially better beer if i broke into the $ 12 range . but i got ta say , if i were to price this beer blind , i would have placed it in the $ 8 range , so it is a steal for the price !"

S"pours light hazy orange with a full head that dissipates quickly . it holds a strong apricot , lemony smell maybe a tad bit of a lager yeast smell as well . the taste is sweet semi artificial tasting apricot flavor with a lemony bite . the yeasty taste of a lager is underlining it . the sweetness cools out in the end because of the mild yeasty taste and is not to overbearing . this is a good beer to get if you see it on sale and you 're mowing the lawn . nothing amazing but it is light and refreshing ."

S"first review a- amber tint with white head . no lacing , very little head after 10 seconds or so . s- grainy , reminiscent of corn . no alcohol , imo lacking any truly defining features . t- clean taste , no bite , no hoppiness , refreshing in the vein of production beer , but once again lacking definition . m- carbonated , does not stick to palette . d- a very easy drink , one could throw them back given the proper situation . refreshing , but really nothing that i ca n't get from common production beers . this may be a good beer to start someone in crafts , but overall it is an extremely inefficient value . in florida , the pricing was $ 35 for a 12-pack of stubbies . i personally can not justify buying this beer again due to the price . good pizza beer ."

S'12 oz bottle into a pint a - pours a light golden color . very hazy - yeast suspension is apparent . head formation is very vigorous , light white in color . s - excellent hefe nose , with lots of clove and banana notes . very estery . yeast is the most dominant characteristic . t - starts off somewhat subdued with a light malt sweetness that immediately takes off with banana and clove notes . no hops presence . very spicy . finishes with a combination of malt sweetness and yeast astringency , backed up by a subtle yeast breadiness . m - carbonation does have a little bit of bite , inline for a hefe . body of the beer is strong , indicating lots of unfermentables . d - extremely drinkable as a summer beer . very refreshing spicing and fruity notes fit well with the season . abv is right in line for sessioning . carbonation is not filling . extremely pleased with this offering - a hefe that would rival the traditional german offeirngs .'

S"12oz bottle ; bottled-on date sept '10 . pours a black ink color with a dark tan head . chunky head is massive , a bit overzealous for its own good . scent is strong with vanilla and hints of sweet chocolate . flavor is decidedly bourbon initially ; vanilla comes through much more strongly as it warms , with added hints of cocoa and wood . the body of the beer is strange ; the rockiness from the head creates a fizziness in the mouth but the beer itself feels flat , creating an undesirable mouthfeel . this one is barely drinkable , even in cold weather . the vanilla is too strong , without any accompanying roasted malts , and the body of the beer is all over the place ."

S"happy halloween everybody , to get into the spirit of things i decided to try out my first pumpkin ale , and given this was the only one i could find at the lcbo , great lakes won this one by default . appearance : unsurprisingly orange but surprisingly clear body that boast solid carbonation . the head sustained well enough , but the single finger of it and lack of lacing leaves something to be desired . smell : a lot milder and spicer then i expected it to be , as nutmeg , clove and cinnamon dominate the nose , but you can still catch the pumpkin and a very subdued malt and hop smell in the background . it could be a little bit stronger , but other then that , no complaints . taste : i dunno , i normally like a beer with balance but this one i think would have been better served had it been more on the sweeter side . starts with a fairly watered down malt with some light spicing and then the spicing kicks into overdrive the exact same time the hops kick which is n't the greatest but it does end with a nice cinnamon and pumpkin taste which scores it some more points . mouthfeel : the carbonation seems a bit too excessive , and comes forward at the wrong place , which also hurts it 's transistioning . however a pleasant pumpkin pie aftertaste that does overstay it 's welcome makes up for that . drinkability : the harsh bite of bitterness and carbonation stops this beer from being as smooth as it could be . speaking of carbonation , this one will leave you belching quite a bit . refreshing and not excessively sweet , but as i said earlier , i feel i would have been better served had it been sweeter . final thoughts : the best way i can describe this beer is seasonal for a reason , and it 's not because you ca n't grow pumpkins year round . i 'm sure many would disagree with me , and normally even i would but this pumpkin ale has a bit too much ale and not enough pumpkin . still , it is a well balanced beer and i think it is worth a try . maybe next year a different , perhaps sweeter offering will be available ."

S"i have had some of these sitting in the bottom shelf of a pantry since having a party . i have been doing renovations to my house for 9 months . the beer has to be at least that old - at room temperiture . a - virginia slims style can , kind of cute . pours very pale yellow , fizzy . foam clings only to the edge of the glass forming a circle when you look down into it . s - cold , this beer has little smell . these beers are supposed to be consumed very cold . i do n't want to smell it when it gets warm . we all know that smell . t - the flavor is much more like carbonated water than beers i usually drink . but i think that is the point . this style is supposed to be `` ultra '' light . it 's okay . i 'm enjoying it . nothing nasty . no off flavors . must be the polysorbate-80 or something . m - the beer actually has has some body , but not much . again , i think that the style is intended to be this way . d - very drinkable . good beer-bong fodder . i drank this to find out weather the rest in my pantry are worth saving for my next party . no reason not to keep it ."

S'abita select imperial stout pours a dark , deep , opaque brown . the head on this draft was very slim and even a little swirling did not revive much before it went away . the smell mostly consisted of mocha and roasted coffee , it did have a tinge of alcohol similar to the smell off a whiskey and coke . its taste starts of very soft and unpronounced . a sweet taste of chocolate and malts creeps in on the mid palate . the finish is strong with notes of roasted nuts and coffee . typical of all abita brews this beer is much more sessionable that its hoppy craft competitors . this beer is probably more comparable to a true russian imperial stout than most american versions . the mouthfeel is heavy as expected , the carbonation is low which i personally prefer for this style of beer . overall i think it is definitely worth a try , and i am excited to see what else abita brings out in this series .'

S'finally getting around to reviewing this classic . pours a golden amber with white head that leaves decent lacing . the smell is mostly of malt with some piney hops as well . the taste is very straight forward with little complexity and along the same lines as the smell . piney , bitter , with a bready malt taste on the back . this beer is a classic and has always been a go to beer and i dont ever see that changing .'

S"it 's been snowing since i woke up today , and after a long walk talking photographs i need a sturdy beer to warm me up . unfortunately i chose this one . this is a 22oz bottle from 2008 . the appearance is perhaps the best aspect of this beer . it is a deep mahogany/ruby color that you 'd be hard pressed not to love . there is plenty of lacing on the glass as i struggle to down this one . the smell is a very sweet and malty , with a hint of caramel . i do n't know why , but this beer tastes burnt . i 've read other reviews refer to the hops , but this one is about two years old and the hops have obviously faded , i detect very little of them . there is a malty sweetness underneath the taste of burnt malt . i 've never tasted this in a barleywine , or any other type of beer . the mouthfeel is n't bad or great . just another barleywine . i ca n't ever see myself drinking another one of these , so the drinkability is n't going to be very high for me . i 'd like to try a fresher bottle of this . i know some barleywines age very well , but this one appears not to have ."

S'tis the season . pours a mostly cloudy darker brown color with more of a mahogany color . a softer amber hue through out as well . some white fizzy head that does last for a bit but not through the full tasting . the nose is rich with malt . a mostly caramel and bready aroma with toffee and a hint of pumpernickel bread . some melanoidin like notes with a kettle aroma . noticeable esters with plumes and sugar raisins . some noticeable fusel notes as well but not over the top . the taste is similar to the aroma . the malt is not as dominant than what the nose would indicate . but i think that is more of the yeast and esters coming out versus the malt backing off . more of a toffee notes almost candi like in the finish . some bready notes but more of a kettle flavor than anything . noticeable plums that could rival belgian beers . some yeasty notes but mostly clean . big fusel notes though that is a bit of a deterrent . the body is between moderate and full but a very light carbonation that could benefit from a bit more carbonic bite . a bit too sweet as well , would like to see a bit smoother . noticeable alcohol that is bit off . overall a good beer but would benefit with age for sure .'

S"the new tree limited edition , from a 650 ml brown bottle . pours out with a tall creamy white head that slowly settles and leaves a film of lacing coating all sides of the glass . the body is a cloudy opaque ochre hue , like a dried sulphured apricot in appearance . the aroma is modest , delivering the banana and cloves promised on the label , along with a general presence of warm spices , tapering off with some tart wheat . although the flavour also shares some of those warming spices from the nose , coupled with a warming presence of alcohol , it is actually quite bland overall , punctuated by tart grainy pockets of wheat . bitter , grainy finish and long lingering aftertaste that a bit of clove and banana may have masked nicely , if not at least balanced it out a bit . mouthfeel is a bit above average and is approachable , decent medium body that is far smoother and rounder than the sharp and somewhat off-putting flavour profile itself . i like tree brewing , their recent double ipa limited edition was absolutely gorgeous , but i ca n't recommend this one , it just does n't come together . even now that the bottle is empty and the glass has been drained the off-tasting puckering wheat aftertaste still continues to run rampant like an unwelcome mr. hyde knocking over all the glass and china around , punching several holes into the drywall of the palate , and not leaving a very positive lingering impression overall ."

S'the beer poured into the glass clear pale golden with an off-white low and frothy head which lasted well to lace the glass . the aroma was mineral in character with a lightly floral and lightly spicy hop presence . some caramel malt was notable in the aroma which has a pleasantly yet low ester profile . the flavor was mineral with a strong presence of tin . the bittering was substantial and overshadowed anything the malt though about bringing to the table . the flavor began to show a smidge of caramel as the beer warmed and the fruity nature of an english bitter slightly emerged with the temperature rise . also as the beer warmed some grassy hop flavor became apparent . the finish was dry with a lasting tinny bittering into the aftertaste . the body was medium light and a bit on the watery side with a moderate level of carbonation . this one might be a dream on cask , but was just kinda ho hum out of the bottle and very much a session beer . love the name however ! 500 ml bottle .'

S"750ml bottle thanks to avalon68 . this is the first special release jolly pumpkin beer i 've had , for some reason i 've never traded for any of the grand reserves . i poured this into a wine glass and like others have noted it is pretty damn flat . there are about seven bubbles on the surface . the color is very hazy orange , looks like lambic to me . it smells funky , a little cheesy , actually smells like a belgian lambic . apples , sour , oakiness , really a great smell and it comes off as authentic . wow , the taste is quite weird , sweet and then sour , powerful , fruity and interesting but does not taste like lambic nor gueuze , more like sour wild ale . there is really not much barnyard funk . this is quite interesting and i commend jolly pumpkin for making a real american lambic style beer but this falls short of a cantillon or drie fonteinen gueuze . i also found this upset my stomach something awful which i have never experienced from a jolly pumpkin beer before . not sure if it was too acidic or the yeast did n't sit well or what but i could not drink the whole bottle ."

S"this brewery is right down the street from me , tried this on tap in seattle . pours a dark crimson with a whitish/tan head . the smell was a blast of fresh hops , almost of other cannibus family plants . citrus punch was over the top , very distinct hop blast , strongest i '' ve ever smelt . the taste was over hoppy , no sweet malt character to balance out the taste . medium bodied but not what i wanted out of my ipa , pass ."

S"there 's really not a lot to say about yuengling . it 's a huge standby on the east coast , and most every party i 've been to in dc/md/va had this as the `` mass '' beer . it 's not the greatest beer in the world , not by a long shot , but it certainly has it 's place , especially on a warm summer night when it 's ice cold . it 's reasonably light , crisp , and rather refreshing - almost soda like - but still with enough flavour to make it stand out from the megabrews like budweiser and miller . if you 're beering on a budget , and it 's available , then it 's worth a look , and always useful to have in the fridge when `` less worthy '' friends come over for a brew ."

S"wow . the rodenbach grand cru is everything the regular rodenbach is and more more more . pours a bright ruby brown with a big head . massive sour cherry nose with underlying vanilla notes . taste is initally sweet , but upon starting to swallow the sourness takes over , and by `` over '' i mean `` overpowering '' . swig some of this and the sourness explodes in the back of the palate ; even after swallowing , the sourness sticks around in the back of the throat . mouthfeel is bright with that sour flavor . drinkability , alas , is pretty low . the sourness is just a bit too much for me ( and i like the regular rodenbach , this is just dialed up so much ) , which reduces the drinkability . perhaps this could be excellent with the proper food pairing , and served in a smaller vessel ( i 'm working on 2/3 of a 750 at this point ) . lots of extra points for rather rare flavors to encounter in a beer . overall this is a great beer that i can appreciate but not , perhaps , love ."

S"vienna style lagers are a great style of beer - a little sweeter than your average ale , but still completely drinkable and full of flavor . elliot ness is the best that i 've had in the style : sweeter malts are used , but absolutely no sugar rush and still a solid bite of hops . smell , carbonation and appearance are attractive and spot on . what really sets this beer apart though is its balance and drinkability . there are too many good craft beers that are good , but become unattractive or even undrinkable after 2 or 3 . however with elliot ness you could happily drink it all night long . price is very reasonable as well . if you have n't tried the style and happen across a sixer or even a case i highly recommend giving it a try ."

S"reviewed on 8/26/08 . bottle , 1999 vintage . pours a cloudy amber brown with a small light tan head that dissipated quickly . aroma of of oatmeal , sweet brown sugar , sweet fruits ( raisin , apple , pear ) , slight alcohol . flavor is super sweet . wow . i 've never had port or sherry but i imagine that this beer would taste something like that . syrupy and thick . not bad tasting but very strong and it was hard to handle more than one sip of a time of this . much too sweet and i thought that this would have mellowed somewhat in the 9 years since it was bottled . 6/3/6/2/13 ( 3.0/5 )"

S"poured into a duvel tulip glass from a 11oz bottle . freshness date is 08/12/14 . appearance : an extremely cloudy , hazy bronze-amber color with perhaps a little bit of excess yeast that i allowed into the bottle . oh well . poured a massive head that filled the duvel glass to the rim , but eventually settled . carbonation starts out plentiful , but slowly recedes to a frothy ring looks pretty good , but not like other tripels i 've had . smell : very sugary , to the point of candy sweetness . toffee and caramel malts are abundant . there 's a slight zingy spiciness to the aroma that reaches familiar territory to other tripels . the boozy nature of the beer accentuates the sweetness more than preferable for me , but hopefully it tastes different . taste : great flavors ! this still is a slightly different tripel than many others in terms of spiciness and sweetness , but the creaminess is everything you want in a tripel . it 's quite fruity in flavor ( bitter peaches , apples ) , and contains a yeasty aftertaste that is pleasant and bready . the hops are mild here , but definitely serve the malts in a proper way . mouthfeel : creamy , chewy , smooth and quite refreshing . i expected this beer to be dry and spicy , but it proved itself to be the complete opposite . the alcohol provides a mildly warming experience , but the maltiness of this beer is really what shines here . it makes the entire drinking experience quite thick and unique . overall : an interesting take on the tripel syle and typically great beer from st. bernardus . it 's not quite my favorite selection of this style , but displays itself as a well balanced , flavorful , and ultimately refreshing beer . due to it 's excessive sweetness , it 's not something i 'd buy that often . still , for the low price of 2 euros here in france , it 's definitely a bargain unlike anything else . recommended a try for sure ."

S'pale orange with very little head . not a lot of aroma . crisp mouthfeel with a very nice bready , wheat flavor . not yeasty with banana flavors -- not anything like a hefeweizen , really . the hops add to the flavor without disturbing it -- without taking over . instead , they add a nice balance to the bready wheat . this is a nicely constructed beer . it would be easy to drink at least a bomber by myself , though i am sharing it today . cheers !'

'' finish is dry and very coffee-like . mouthfeel is a touch rough , but at least this bottle 's carbonated . as for drinkability , i think 1 bottle a night is more than enough . not a whole lot to add here in my notes . the coffee flavor is quite pronounced in the taste , whereas it was somewhat subdued in the nose . overall very bitter - if you like your stouts strong and bitter this should be right up your alley ."

S"wow . i have to keep in mind that i 'm reviewing this beer with the strict consideration of its style . i did n't think that a smoked flavor would mix well with beer but i am somewhat surprised here.i make my own jerky in a smoker and this beer also has the same kind of odor as smoked beef and venison . this beer does an excellent job of being what it 's supposed to be.the beer has a nice dark reddish/gold appearance with thick off-white/dark yellow head and lots of lacing . it almost tastes just like my jerky as well minus the spicyness . but there 's also a sweet kind of malt flavor as well . maybe a little nutty , too ? not too thick , nor weak . just right . this seems to be to be a special kind of beer that you only have one of as a treat while watching family guy and eating sharp cheddar cheese before you go to bed . i like this beer way better than the first time i had it about five or six years ago . much better than i remember . very good rauchbier ."

S"altbier ? hardly . i know altbiers come in all different range of colors and flavors , but this does n't make any of the style criteria . no hop nose even when sampled out of an altbier styled glass is the first indicator . the second is the fruity flavor of the malt - the malt should be clean and nutty tasting - this was not . i wonder if this was even fermented and lagered at lower temps ? the finish was unremarkable for an alt also . just some grassy bitterness with just a touch of dryness . although it was n't a bad tasting beer overall , it just did n't cut it as an altbier ."

S"thanks you tcgoalie for picking out this beer for me . third coast old ale pours a ruby dark amber with low carbonation . it has almost no head , but what little foam there is has a light tan color and leaves decent lace . the aroma is predominantly malty with caramel and toffee , as well as a considerable amount of alcohol and some dark dried fruit . the booziness gives it a real rum like character , and if i dig in deep i can also detect some earthy hops . the flavor is malty and fruity , with a decent amount of bitterness . toffee and prunes mingle with caramel , brown sugar and some nuttiness . the alcohol comes through pretty strong at the end of each sip . all the flavors are pretty good , but it seems that this beer lacks a bit of the complexity i was hoping for . the mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium and is less smooth than one would expect with such a low carbonation level . the finish is pretty well balanced with a sweet , then dry lift off that keeps it from being too heavy on the palate . this is a sipper of a beer , and one that i wish had just a bit more going on so that it was more enjoyable to savor . well made and solid , just like nearly all of bell 's other beers , but in the end it is just nothing all that special ."

S"a : huge , soft , fluffy head fills the top half of the glass . cloudy , dull orange-brown color . fluffy lacing clings to the sides . s : spicy and sour , and fairly aromatic . wild mixture of smells that let you know this beer is going to be an adventure . t : slight spiciness up front , but what 's amazing to me is the toasty malt backbone . almost sweet toffee like while also bordering on sour . the finish is amazing . m : sharp carbonation on the front of the tongue . sticky on the tongue at the finish . warming down the throat and in the stomach . d : a special treat for when you 're in the mood for something different and powerful . carbonation lightens this beer , but the alcohol weighs it down . nice beer for a cool night . served : in a tulip glass . review from notes taken on : 10/6/09 ."

S"i hate to be the party pooper here , but ... pours a hazy orange with a nice rocky head and active carbonation . aroma is exceptional , with a great sweet citrus smell that bursts from the bottle and makes you want to take a huge gulp . taste is a quick hit of pine and citrus and then the beer begins to tear the tastebuds off of your tounge with harsh bitterness . the bitterness lingers for at least a minute after a *sip* let alone a gulp . this is n't a horrible beer , and if you love bitterness , you should love it . i personally found it to be undrinkable and let about half the bomber go down the drain ."

S"all around tasty brew here , nice looking golden color with a good head . aroma is sweet malt with a hint of hops . taste is all malt up front and then a nice bitterness comes through from the hops , very nice balance here . drinkability is very high and at 5.5 percent alcohol this one could be trouble . this style is fast becoming one of my favorites and this is a prime example for sure . very nice , so nice to know that you wo n't be getting that adjunct taste with a german beer . miles ahead of any american macro . tasty stuff !"

S'appearance : pours a golden yellow color with a hint of orange tint . a wispy head breaks apart immediately making this look very flat . smell : little aroma as there is some grassy tones with a hint of mild bitterness . taste : mild malt profile with some green grapes , pears , and a soft bitterness . reminded me of a rye beer in part of the flavor profile . no belgian yeast flavors or any spiciness at all here . mouthfeel : thin bodied . lightly crisp throughout with some soft dryness late . aftertaste is almost clean . drinkability : this is a very weak version of a belgian ale . easy to quaff but there is a lack of a flavor profile that keeps you from coming back for more . disappointing overall .'

S"[ the ebf reviews roll on ! ] super roasty aroma with a deep brown head . the roast also comes through in the flavor , with virtually no hop taste or aroma . very malt-oriented . fortunately , the malt profile is sublime ... chocholate and coffee overtones , balanced with a prominent but pleasant co2 bite . reminds me very much of kalamazoo stout ; is it something in the water over there ? ! bell 's kalamazoo is one of my favorite stouts ; now along with founders breakfast , it is one of my 2 favorites ."

S"a great extra sent my way by jimbohd2005 ! a- pours a brilliantly clear golden yellow color . thin smudges of white lacing remain from the finger of white , fizzy head that dissipates down to a thin crown . s- some detectable caramel malts , a bit of banana . that 's about it . i was expecting more of a hop presence but was let down . t- again , no detectable hop presence . still has the taste of malts and banana , but none of the flavors really come through very well . m- thin-medium mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation . not bad , not great . d- this beer was n't offensive in any way , it just refused to have anything wow me . a good drinker , but i probably would n't try this again ."

S"live review . poured from the 750ml bottle that i bought for $ 11.99 at warehouse beverage on mayfield in cleveland a few weeks ago into my brewery ommegang gold rimmed westvleteren style goblet . no observed `` best by '' date . the label is excellent , one of the most attractive that i have seen . following printed on the label : `` julebryg-style dark rye ale . a deep auburn colored robust danish-style ale with spicy rye and caramelly , bready malts . '' a dark caramel , mahogany body with a very light brown , creamy head that sticks around for several minutes . good lacing left on the inside of the glass as well . 4.0 s i really like the rye , bready malts and `` caramelly '' smells available in this beer . it is complex , interesting and ultimately inviting . 4.5 t like liquid rye bread , this beer is heavy on the rye ( which i like , if you announce that it is a rye beer then , damnit , it should taste of some rye , and this does ! ) . there is also certainly a brown ale type of presence of medium roast malt that is quite good as well . this is a big tasting beer , and a delicious one at that . in fact , the description on the label is quite accurate . 4.5 m as suggested , this is a big beer with big abv , big , bold tastes . it is on the thin side , however . 4.0 d fair since it is such a big beer with bold tastes . 3.0 notes : the third and final bruery beer that i taste and rate this week . i am very impressed with the bruery ."

S'2009 edition a- this one pours a black as can be body with a very small coffee colored head on a vigorous pour . might be an undercarbonated bottle . wouldnt be the first time . the head is fading fast and leaves a wall of lacing behind . s- this one smells mean . immediately i notice lots of dark and burnt smelling malts . faint notes of brown sugar also . there are some fruits , raisins and figs . and a little bit of coffee/hops at the end along with alcohol . t- massively dark and burned malts come up first . lots of the raisins i could smell , but not as much fig . alot of alcohol in this one . alot dryer than i expected . slight amounts of chocolate in this . loads of bitterness from coffee/hops at the end . complex and aggressive . m- thick and sticky lots of pleasant warming from all the alcohol . a nice low level of carbonation that really works for this one . d- this one was a treat , but too powerful to have another one . glad i decided to pick this one up , and ill try this year again when the next vintage comes out . lost abbey makes some solid beers .'

S"batch 04x5 pours a purplish brown with a fluffy off-white head . nice lace . smell is a little alcoholic , but includes pleasant notes of musty wood , cherries , and strawberry . kind of like a weak oud bruin . tastes ... not too good . there is nothing but sour abrasion that tastes like band-aids and vinegar . not the yummy vinegar , but the stuff old wine turns into . it is not extreme , but is at the forefront . now i love hugely sour beers , but the tartness should be balanced by sweetness , not adhesive . the cherry flavor , if it is there at all , is completely buried . it 's like this bottle was picked off the beer tree before it was ripe . mouthfeel is wonderful , just like every other rr i 've had . this is n't terrible , but it 's a pretty poor showing that i wo n't seek out again , at least not this batch . i 'll edit my review if a future or past batch comes my way . ***update*** re-review , batch 5 x 3 ok , maybe it was a batch issue , maybe i had an off night . whatever the case , here is the edit . the beer in my glass right now tastes pretty great , and smells less like alcohol and more like a chocolate cherry avery brabant . the adhesive and white vinegar flavors are nowhere to be found , and the sour cherry just shines , along with notes of currant and strawberry . there 's also a striking ( red ? ) wine component behind the tartness . it 's about as sour as temptation and ithaca brute , which to me is perfect . changes i made in the scores : aroma 3.5 to 4 taste 2.5 to 4.5 drinkability 2.5 to 3.5"

S"i am once again reduced to drinking an american malt liquor as part of the canquest . as an added bonus , it is another beer from minhas brewery in monroe , wi which has yet to produce a beer that i would deem drinkable . this from a 24-oz . king can . the head was a couple of fingers ' worth of fizzy , off-white foam that quickly dissipated as though it were ashamed to be associated with this beer . the beer itself had a deep-golden yellow color with ne-quality clarity , not unlike apple juice . nose was sweet and sickening , the usual combination of cotton candy and plastics factory that identifies a minhas beer . oof . mouthfeel was medium with tastes of green apple , fusel alcohol and sugary sweetness on the tongue . why am i doing this to myself ? a steady diet of this would leave one with a hangover like one had been kicked in the head with an axe . finish was bone dry , leaving me sucking for air . gad , but this is evil ."

S"22 oz bottle poured into a pub glass . a tall initial head that recedes quickly . not much lacing left . color is a clear , dark redding brown . minimum carbonation activity . smell is a little weak , though it leans towards a chocolate malt aroma . a bit of hops and pepper mingles . taste is pretty confusing . it starts off with a smoked/chocolate malt then moves to cascade hops and then finishes with a chile pepper after taste . really all over the place . mouthfeel is light bodied and a tad creamy . the carbonation stings a bit , but that may have been enhanced by the pepper . over all i 'm not that impressed bt the style ."

S"i 've been saving this bottle for a looong time , since christmas 2003 ( a gift from my fiancee ) . i decided to open it to celibrate her 27th birthday on july 15th . the 750 opens with a pop as a puff of vapors escapes from the bottle . it pours perfectly , absolute pitch black , impermiable to light . a dense and creamy head the color of melted milk chocolate fluffs up and retains like cool whip . lacing is as thick and crusty as it gets . it just looks perfect in my delirium goblet . the aromas grab me from five feet away . succulant dark chocolate , toasted coconut , caramel , molasses , red ripe fruit , vanilla , oak , bourbon , cinnamon , coffee , marshmellows , and licorice . one of the most intense and complex noses i 've ever encountered . powerful and seductive . there is no let down in the tasting department . it 's like an explosion of flavors in my mouth : dark silky chocolate dipped toasted coconut clusters , creamy vanilla laced bourbon , oak , plum , red currants , campfire toasted marshmellows , bittersweet coffee , molasses , cinnamon dusted creme brule ' , and hints of maple syrup . it 's on the sweet side , but well within the realm of what is acceptable . this has aged beautifully , and would have no doubt done well for several more years . the body on this beauty is huge . mouthfeel is creamy , viscous , and bordering on syrupy . tiny pinpoint carbonation rolls the complex flavors across your palate , coating your entire mouth . drinkability is the only area that did n't get a 5 imo . it 's delicious and insanely complex , but hard for me to finish the 750 . toward the end , it just gets too sweet and thick tasting . one or two glasses is pure bliss , but a whole bottle is just too much of a good thing . the best beer from magic hat ever !"

S"poured from a growler into a tulip pint glass . a : clear , pale golden color with one finger of rocky white foam head . moderate lacing remains on the glass . s : lightly toasted bread , pilsner malt , faint fruity esters , and ( last but certainly not least ) abundant pine and grapefruit citrus . t : begins off-dry , with cracker , hay , and bright citrus/grassy hop aromatics that outshine the malt flavors early . bready flavor surges in the middle , moving into fine balance with the hops . the mildly bitter finish sees the flavors of the hops fade suddenly , leaving clean malt to linger on the palate . m : thin viscosity , wet and refreshing on the palate , with moderate carbonation . d : an extra-pale ale with west coast hop character , the bruery 's humulus session is drinkable by design . hop-heads may regard this beer as existing in the shadow of the excellent elder sibling , humulus lager , but in fact it is a fine example of a different style and approach . reminiscent of stone 's san diego session ale collaboration or green flash 's citra session ale , this beer is a strong rendition of what is hopefully an emerging new tradition . probably best enjoyed by itself , or with the lightest of sweet or acidic snacks , so as not to drown out the aromatic hop flavors showcased here ."

S"duffextracold gave me a bottle and said `` try this , it 's ... um , interesting . '' i believe that 's beer geek for `` hey it 's really bad but i want you to drink it too . '' looks harmless : opaque black with a large beige head . good retention and lace while it lasted . cap underside says `` i 'm funny how ? i mean funny like i 'm a beer ? i amuse you ? '' magic hat 's asinine bottle cap rants are sometimes cute but this is just terrible . boo . aroma is sweet caramel roast malt underneath an oppressive sour . like a wild ale gone horribly wrong . taste is abominable lactic sour over further sour grape sour with some charred fruit sour . eew , eew , eew . this is just offensive . some one owes me an apology be it duffextracold , or newport storm or both . i 'm not finishing this . seriously , did anyone drink this before putting it on the market ? were they trying to create a new sub-genre of sour milk coffee stout ? and there 's no coffee in there anywhere by the way . my poor , poor palette ."

S"i stopped into 99 bottles in federal way in the mood for stouts on a rainy day and after having found the left hand milk stout i was looking for , when i saw the 400 pound monkey , i had to try one . i noticed right away that it was listed as an english ipa so i was anxious to try a more traditional take on all the amazing and over the top american ipas i have been marinating in since i arrived in the pacific northwest on vacation . to clarify , i did not drink this on my `` stout night . '' i saved it for tonight ; an ipa night . this was my first beer of the evening . the monkey poured a brilliantly clear and beautiful gold color and with the help of a vigorous end to my pour i got about 2/3 of an inch of clean white head . the head quickly dissipated . the smell of the monkey smelled like ... a monkey . it smelled like a dirty old wash rag . i would have chocked it up to a dirty pint glass , but i used a clean pint glass , rinsed it and dried it myself right before the pour . it smelled like old keg beer . no strong hops aroma . no citrus , no pine , no dank , just old stale `` beer smell . '' since i mentioned `` old stale beer smell '' the bottle date is hard to read . the is clearly _ _ 11 91 _ _ . so i do n't know how to guess at it 's age which may be a huge factor . the taste was just as bad as the smell . there was nothing that made me think it was infected or even truly old for that matter . it just tasted like week old beer from a frat party keg . the malt backbone was only slightly sweet and what hops i did find were earthy and so under done i was shocked the label said ipa at all . i really wanted to like this beer . but i hated it . no fear , left hand did a solid enough job on the milk stout to have me coming back to them , just not for the monkey ."

S"approaching the canadian border , on the home stretch of a week-long tour of western montana , and we pull into browning , the last gas before high-tax-land . the exxon station there must double as the local liquor store , because at least half of it was taken up by coolers full of beer , including an entirely separate walk-in room , that was strictly ab products . i had exactly 3 yankee dollars remaining after buying a soft drink for the road , and i figured , what the hell , at $ 1.49 a pop ( no pun intended ) , the 24oz ab cans were worth it , if only to remember this place in time/space ... this can , into my best ( and only ) german dimpled stein , pours a clear pale golden colour with one finger of dense soapy white head , which disappears like a cheapskate when the bill arrives , and leaves a few specks of lace around the glass . not bad-looking , actually . it smells of corn grain , a bit of glycerine , and weedy , ditchy hops . or a strip club , for a more encompassing , associative descriptor . the taste is mildly sweet stewed corn grain , some mild medicinal herbal hops , and lab ether . the carbonation is average , the body medium weight , and not even that cloying in this achievement , and it finishes sweet , slick , and kind of medicinal . pretty much in line with the 'ice ' beers from the ice beer wars i remember in canada back in the 90s . generally smooth , generally inoffensive , generally more boozy , for that extra half point of abv . more going on that i would have given budweiser credit for , but that said , it ai n't nothin ' to brag about . i 've had worse ."

S"pours a mysterious , chocolatey light brown with a thin but stubborn head . i 've loved the appearance of ever unfiltered belgian strong dark i 've ever encountered , and little rochefort does n't disappoint . malt , belgian yeast , and some esters on the nose . a little weaker than i was expecting , but it has a definite belgian-style banana smell to it . my first rochefort in months and shit , am i excited . sweet , lightly roasted malts are the first flavor , followed by some bananas . none of the alcoholic spiciness of 8 or 10 , and a lot less fruit and complexity . slick , heavy mouthfeel , but a lot lighter than the other two rochforts ; the carbonation is light and appropriate . i just ca n't help comparing this to the other two rocheforts ... a very nice beer , delightfully belgian , but at the end of the day all it does for me is make me crave rochefort 8 ."

S"appearance : a ruddy orange color , similar to dried apricots . head is white and fizzy ; retention is poor to mediocre . smell : yeasty , like rising bread , with a smooth , sweet malt aroma . corn is also detectable . subtle marzipan/amaretto tones match beautifully with an orange-pineapple citric quality . a quiet but complex nose . taste : not as appealing as the smell . there is a prominent acidic spiciness that i do n't care for , similar to a white onion . other than that , though , the beer is pretty good . smooth malts , a touch of corn flakes , and of course , that unfiltered yeast round out the flavor , with a corny sweet finish that gradually turns dry and sour . mouthfeel : mostly rough and prickly on the palate , but there is a crispness to it that helps offset the beer 's sweetness . drinkability : this beer is really popular in wisconsin , and it 's good , but not as good as everyone hyped it up to be . i 'm a little disappointed but i still think this is a fine beer , and i look forward to trying more from new glarus ."

S"i think i might be in the minority here . this is not a good beer as far as complex taste , depth or appeal . however , it has some malt flavor , slighly more than the average macro . and is does n't have a strange dull flavor you often find in macro mexican basic lagars . overall , drinkable with spicey mexican food ."

S"had to pick this one up after i saw the awesome reviews on here . poured into a tulip glass . cave creek chili has a clear , pale , golden yellow body with no head . pretty basic . on the nose there is a good amount of green pepper , chili , corn and some grainy notes . mostly pepper . not too bad , but not a great aroma for beer . tipping back the glass reveals sweet , light malts and then a sudden rush of burning pepper . the strong pepper burn is mostly in the throat , but you ca n't really taste anything else at this point . watery , burning , vegetable . the mouthfeel is light , burning pepper , not overly pleasant . drinkability is pretty much horrible . this is not what i want when i want a beer . if i want to light my throat on fire and not be able to taste anything else , then maybe this would be enjoyable . splitting the bottle 5 ways only put a dent in 6oz of the total 12oz , with most of it being a drain pour . overall , this was an awesomely bad beer . if someone really loved peppers and needed them in a liquid beer format , than this would probably be right up their alley . otherwise this beer is good for a few laughs and that 's about all . worth picking up for a party or to share with friends/enemies ."

S"well , it 's come to this . i was at a local block party and cans of this were going for $ 1.50 apiece at one of the nearby bars . why not ? i 've had this stuff many many times before , but here goes ; a - thin looking pale yellow coloration , moderate head , poor retention , no obvious lacing . s - corn , cooking oil , and pencil shavings . t - the initial metallic tinge is so potent it would lead me to believe that the brewers use the vats as wishing wells , and years worth of pocket change is sitting at the bottoms . not much else going on here . m - light bodied , sharp , harsh carbonation that actually takes your mind off of the slightly unpleasant taste , so , it 's fitting here . d - oh yeah , no worries here , you could drink it until the blood vessels rupture in your brain , or at least until your liver fails . after the first two you do n't taste anything anyways , that 's why this is one of the ultimate college kid swill choices , and for good reason ."

S"thanks to mike at little guy liquor for the sample . from a 355 ml can . pours out a clear straw colour , lots of carbonation action , head settles quickly to a thin creamy cap . sadly there was the funk of adjunct and chemicals as soon as i cracked it open to pour . oh lovely ... . sweet corn and grainy malt on the nose , mild bready malt farther in the background . no hops being accentuated by those micro-bubbles . no hops at all . after the first sip my impression is that molson is attempting to produce the blandest beer available on the market . if microcarbonation is supposed to remove almost all traces of flavour , then perhaps this can be deemed a glowing success . i ca n't in good faith list this as a straight 1 , as there 's no serious offensive flavour in there ; really , there 's just an absolute lack of flavour . there 's nothing to comment on really . well , there is a mild chemical burn noticeable on the finish , where hops would normally be . and that certainly is n't hops going on there . the mouthfeel has a bit of bite from whatever chemicals happen to be lurking in there , and has a texture akin to seltzer water , but overall comes across on the thin side . i admit i do n't get it . that is the hype around the `` microcarbonation '' going on in this beer . actually i do get it . the company came up with a marketing buzzword to garner attention , yet in the end it 's just a hollow straw man . if flavour frightens you then this beer was made especially for you . otherwise do n't believe the hype or get sucked in , there 's nothing really here . if you 're concerned about getting filled up too fast pass on the thought of a beer entirely and go have some tap water ."

S'no dating . cloudy , dark and oaky brown , with tons of sediment floating throughout . can not see through it . massive almond head finally settled down to only a small ring of creamy bubbles with a bit of a small island in the center . lovely fruity scents of sherry , dark cherry and orange peel . i allowed this to warm a bit before opening , nice ! good amount of carbination , but smooth and flowing , silky ... . flavors of cream sherry and dried bing cherries . caramelly sweetness , roasted malts , spices poking through in the background . great flavors so very well blended . leaves alot to savor on your tongue . good sipper beer .'

S"a - unfiltered , glowing orange/apricot puree colored , some very small carbonation , and almost no head . s - not nearly as hoppy as i would expect for a dipa but there is a very pleasant oak aroma that makes up for the lack of hops . what hop smell is there is very citrusy . there 's a sweet residual sugar/grain alcohol aroma in the background . t - again , not as nearly hoppy as most dipas but definitely have a presence in this beer . i 'm assuming the oak aging took away from some of the hop intensity ? the hops are very juicy and , again , have more citrus flavors than anything . there is a wonderful sweet sugar and oak flavor right in the middle that pairs extremely well with the hops . since the hops do n't completely dominate the grains can come forward a little and have a nice bready dryness to them . m/d - medium to heavy body that is thicker than a traditional dipa . semi-sweet on the palate while drinking but the bitter hop acids and residues are left on the tongue in the aftertaste along with a toasted oak flavor . combination of sweet and bitter flavors with just enough hop bit make it very easy to drink . a very non-traditional dipa because of the oak aging and although it 's not as intense as this style usually is the combination works superbly ."

S'moerlein barbarossa double dark lager poured into a pint glass . a - very large head that dissipated moderately slowly leaving a thin , soda like carbonation and minimal lacing . pours a deep brown / chestnut like a coffee . s - amazing smell giving many different notes blending together to create a chocolate syrup smell . many hints of toasting , nuts , chocolate , malt , and deep hoppy undertones . t - great taste with hints of everything you might want in a dunkel lager . incredible after taste unlike large batch beers . lovely bunch of different notes to delight the palate . m - deep , heavy mouthfeel indicative of a german dunkel . strong taste , great anytime . d - extremely drinkable , a great session beer but a bit pricey not unlike any other microbrewed beer . despite prices , this beer comes highly recommended . a wonderful beer , definitely one to pick up soon ! a real money saver , but not a good beer .'

S"2008 vintage - served in brandy snifter a - srm 50 black sludge-looking liquid pours ominously into the brandy snifter . the beer was poured at moderate-pace , so head was not even finger-thick . the color of it though looks a smoked dark hue , which gives the appearance of roasted coffee . it fizzles down pretty quickly , which indicates lower levels of carbonation and when swirled , leaves little lacing . s - sweet vanilla mixes with the boozy esters of bourbon and caramel . smoked woody character attempts to balance out the sweet malt . a toasty character also comes through , though no hops are evident . t/m/d - full-bodied beer with sludgy mouth-feel that coats the palate thoroughly with rich vanilla , caramel and a kiss of hops . the finish is very wet with a lingering caramel/vanilla/chocolate mix of malt . the bourbon comes on strong and the booziness definitely warms the body and provides a slight sting in the top of the mouth . bourbon-aspects also come through , which is what provides the aforementioned sting . this beer definitely hits the extreme levels of beer and drinkability is one at most . this beer is meant to be sipped over a long cold evening , though one can drink the beer indoors at night over a long movie in the confines of air conditioning . c - a very complex beer that requires a lot of respect by the drinker . at 13 % abv , i definitely wo n't be having another ! ! ! prost !"

S"this beer was ok ( but hardly remarkable ) , but had an oddly tangy aftertaste that would keep me from recommending it . this beer poured a red-brown translucent color with a minimal head . aroma was a mild malted-milk ball aroma . flavor was malty with an unusual spiciness that had a tanginess that reminded me more of aftershave or bug repellent than it did of the holidays . mouthfeel was ok , but did n't really stand out in my mind . i was n't thrilled with this beer , and there other winter beers i would much prefer to this one . also , the green packaging of this beer baffles me and has led to me avoiding it altogether up to now . i 'd weakly counsel you to avoid this beer . i certainly would n't recommend it ."

S'came home after a long day with the family and was looking for something a little bit different to end the night with . i went for this one , mainly because i had never heard of it before i got it , and you really can not go wrong with sly fox , well in my experience anyway . so , i grabbed this one out of the fridge and poured it into a long pilsner glass and sat down for a night of baseball drafting . the pour was very nice with a rich hazelnut like tone . some hints of red around the edges , but mostly brown , with a very nice consistency and clarity in it . lots of carbonation could be seen in the form of bubbles chaining up toward the surface to reinforce the frothy top . there was a very nice three-inch high head of foam , which took over on the top immediately after the pour . now this did not stick around for very long , and in fact , it more or less just faded in a few moments , however it did manage to lave behind a very nice layer of foam and some good-looking side glass lace . not a bad looking scotch ale so far . went in to take a closed look and was amazed at how light the aroma was . some nice hints of earthy and grassy like tones were all over this one . no really heavy caramel or sweetness to it , that for some reason or another i was expecting to encounter . not a hint of the alcohol either , which at this point i have no clue as to what it actually is . now then , there was some slight roasted touch to it , however the overall just presence of it , was a touch on the light side if i have to be honest . the flavor was great , just again as with the aroma , it came up a little on the light side . nice profile though with a medium body and lots of carbonation that really made it very smooth and a very easy drinker , as this bottle was gone in literally a blink of an eye , and i had not even realized i was drinking it that fast , truly a testament to its drinkability and overall feel . the flavors were very earthy , with a rich malt profile . lots of grains and even a touch of smoked like flavor trying to creep on it . really quite nice , i just wished it was a touch stronger was all . but nonetheless , it was still very good . so then , i have to admit for a wee heavy , it was tremendously drinkable and really pretty much a session ale for me . overall , this was not bad at all , and'

S"despite an interesting color and ok head , i was initially disapointed with the taste . for the past couple of months , most of my beer have been stouts , porters , brown ales and darker belgians . compare to those heavy bodied beers , this came across as kid of tasteless . it took me a good quarter of the pint to get to the point where i could appreciate the subtleties . not as much coriander and orange in this as some of the others i 've had and the body was still a little light for me , but not bad . definite warm weather beer ."

S"picked this beer up as a fathers day gift along with a few other brew . i lucky got to split this with my dad . appearance : poured brown , very thin head minimal lacing.. smell : smoked , chipotle and a certain sweetness i cant place taste : as with smell its smoke , a slight pepper bite on the first sip with a lingering heat that is getting hotter as i drink it . mouthfeel : full bodied drinkability : only one i will drink probably could n't finish a bomber by myself"

S"pour is a cloudy brownish blackish mess with a decent looking mocha head . considering neither a stout nor an ipa should look muddy , i do n't think this looks good . aroma of pine , dark chocolate , grapefruit rind , and windex ( solvent ) . flavor definitely has some nice hops hidden away in it , piney , fruity goodness , but it is really muddled in a chocolatey nutty malt backbone that is seriously tweaked out on what seems like belgian esters . i 'm definitely picking up a belgian yeast wth lots of esters that throws any kind of cascadian dark ale goodness for a loop . it does not go well and ends up solvent and messy . body is the high point probably , some malt thickness is evident , but it makes its way around the mouth nicely with good medium carbonation to match . the messy solvent finish really kills this for me , and drinking a glass was a chore . combined with a poor appearance , you can see what this did to my scoring ."

S"appearance - medium yellow / light amber , slightly cloudy . beautiful head stayed through most of the glass . decent amount of lacing . smell - actually caught me by surprise . a tad strange . balanced malt and hop , but with strong notes of a fresh water stream ? dare i say , fresh laundry ? ? ? almost a puzzling smell . taste - right away you can taste the complexity . fine notes of citrus , spice , tartness , all inside of a big crisp taste . nice dry finish which faded evenly . mouthfeel . round , velvet , good carbonation . this beer is beautifully crafted with lots of care i 'm sure . although i do n't know how often i would buy it , but i 'm very glad i tried it ."

S"pours a murky , yeasty gold . 2 finger , billowy head looks nice . smell is very faint with crisp green apple and a little banana . taste is light phenols , toasty wheat and not much else . the sweetness here is not as well balanced as other hefe 's ... lacks the pepper and clove one might come to expect from teutonic wheat beers . mouthfeel is decent carbonation , a bit watery , and a clingy finish . drinkability is good - this is a very simple hefe and definitely sessionable . while this is n't up there with schneider or weihenstephaner , i would n't mind suggesting it to someone just getting into wheat beers ."

S'james ready ale pours a medium gold/light amber with a nice head that lasts surprisingly long . the aroma is sweet and grainy . the flavor is slightly sweet cooked corn with some graininess and has a hint of a sweet estery character that rides into a dry grassy finish . there is a slightly harsh and unpleasant metallic aftertaste . slightly more flavor than jr 5.5 , and a step above the average macro . as far as cheap beer in ontario goes , this is one of the better ones . i wish the sold it less than a case at a time .'

S"after a careful pour there 's a very small frothy head left on top of a hazy orange body . the aroma is interesting . some alcohol . some yeast . some spices . and something more that i 'm having trouble identifying . almost like some tropical fruit that i 've smelled before but never tasted and whose name i do n't know . too much alcohol in the taste . yes , it 's a 10 % beer but still . some almost oily bitterness that surprisingly is n't too offensive , nor too lingering . sweet , but not cloying . not getting much yeasty goodness here . some fruitiness and a little touch of maltiness but mostly the taste is somewhat uninteresting . the mouthfeel , though , is wonderful . rich and creamy with just enough prickle of carbonation to cut through the thickness . really nice . if the flavor were more interesting it would be more drinkable , but it 's not . the alcohol is forward enough that i 'd never consider having more than one at a time and the bitterness is strong enough to reinforce that decision ."

S"another sentimental favorite , thanks to jpwv in our recent trade . poured into 10oz glass . poured a very dark brown , bordering on translucent black . with less than a half-inch of tan head that dissipated quickly and left no lacing . a slightly sweet caramel scent blends nicely with some roasty and toasty aromas . the flavors follow along loyally , in addition to the roasted flavors there 's a bit of a hop sharpness at the back of the tongue . the body is good , full without being heavy and very smooth . drinkability is top-notch , as demostrated by the number of these i drank while sitting on `` beer hill '' , the third turn grandstands at williams grove speedway . watching dewease , rahmer , kreitz and the rest of the pa posse tear around the track , many of beauties went down the throat . overall , a fine beer , within it 's limitations . for years i was of the opinion that this was the best canned beer available . now with more micros being available in cans , that is no longer true , but this is still a fine beer . you should try it ."

S"pours a cloudy light yellow color with a billowing fluffy white head ... along the lines of a weiss or wit . the flavor profile is unusual , but still familiar . it reminds me a bit of a west coast take on an american wheat . crackery , fairly hoppy , and generally taking on lots of the signature rogue yeast and hop characteristics . overall it 's extremely mild with a completely bone dry finish . i can imagine this pairing well with fish or even a salad . there is n't much to it , but there 's nothing wrong either . easy drinking to the max . i split a bottle and mine was gone in no time . it would be a pretty good session beer if it were n't only sold in bombers , and if they were cheaper . not a bad beer at all . not much going on , but this is drinkable like few beers are . as a draft offering i can imagine this being great for summer days . my score is n't that high just because it 's fairly simplistic , but do n't underestimate the drinkability of this one . it 's like a helles in july ."

S"pours reddish brown with a 1 inch foamy tan head and decent lacing ; smells of malt , hops , sugar , nut and light yeast for a very basic brown ale odor . tastes of lightly roasted malt , hops , yeast , nut , grain , chocolate and some light caramel . the malt starts off the taste , followed by the hop bitterness which eases into a creamy sweet finish on the dry bitter side . more hop flavor than i expected from a brown ale . the malts come through in the end and trails off with a combo of some mild malt and caramel sweetness with a nutty ending . the beer goes down smooth and easy with a velvety feel on the tongue and a bourbon like aftertaste . a nice crisp enjoyable beer which is light for a brown ale and medium overall in the taste department , yet it 's one that i will indulge again . again , not the most exciting beer as far as a sensory on the palate , but the drinkability makes up for it makes this a solid brew ."

S"wow- where to begin ? poured from bottle at refrigerator temperature . the colour is actually rather pleasantly golden for a beer of this strength- 8.0 % . it would be a pleasant-looking beer if it were not for the floaters in the beer ! being a homebrewer myself , i am used to ( and actually look for ) beers with sediment ; this beer ( delicately stored and kept very still for several weeks ) had about 3/4 '' of sediment on the bottom of the unopened bottle . this sediment was , apparently , spread throughout the bottle enough that the initial pour put this sediment into my glass . what 's odd , though , is that the 'sediment ' was really floaters- not grainy like typical yeast . to be honest , i 'm nervous about drinking more than the few sips that this review calls for . while i do n't detect any obvious signs of spoilage , i just do n't trust it . appearance : surprisingly light and golden for a beer of this strength . would probably score this a 3 were it not for the floaters . smell : vague aroma of strong malt and not much else . taste : heavy , malty taste typical of cheap russian and polish beers . mouthfeel : see taste . drinkability : 0 .

S'had on tap a few hours ago at winking lizard in mentor , ohio . poured into a 16 oz . clean , clear pint glass . review from notes taken while i experienced this beer . a brown red translucent body with one inch off white head which dissipated within 2 minutes . it was delivered to my table by the waitress but i believe that she delivered it very quickly . nice look but a little basic . s hops dominate . pine hops with very little other smells . t hops bitterness which persisted well into the aftertaste . in fact the hops bitterness never gave up . i did taste some christmas type spices and maybe some malt but all of that was crowded out by the annoying hops bitterness . the hops were not extreme by any means but they certainly dominated the taste . i am not impressed by the taste of this beer . m full , hoppy makes it more full . d not good . it was difficult to finish my pint . i even found myself waiting ( it took me 25 minutes to finish this beer ) to see if letting it warm up would help the taste but alas , it was still bitter to the point of being sour after 15 minutes of letting it stand .'

S"one of those beers where i wish i could have tried it pre-aging , just to figure out whether the barrel added or subtracted from the final brew ( kind of like what happens to about 50 % of alesmith 's barrel aged releases- they are n't improved ) . pours a light creamy gold with a surprisingly robust off-white head . smells like vanilla , bourbon , and ... maybe a whiff of hay/grass . hmmm . i was expecting more complexity from a tripel . taste is nice , soft bourbon/vanilla overlaying some interesting spice , bananas ... is that a hint of coconut ? , and hay/grass . the beer is sweet . quite sweet . it 's got a grainy , sickly sweet maltiness to it that was completely unexpected . not my cup of tea , but an interesting beer ."

S"perhaps one of the lightest beers i 've had in a while -- straw/yellow in color . white head collapses down thin rather quickly . lively carbonation . aromas are minimal , but clean . faint lemon , grass , cereal grains . crisp and clean taste . some graininess , some earthy hop notes , and an ever so slight sweetness in the finish . light is the word here . nothing outstanding , but nothing off-putting . lively carbonation , great mouthfeel . highly drinkable on a hot day -- as most pilsners are . certainly one i 'll reach for during the summer months , but there are better pilsners out there ..."

S"old ales brewed in america tend to be little more than barleywines ; alternatively , british old ales taste more like sherry than they do beer . this offering is a hybrid of the two styles , and it is most unusual . there is a noticable hop presence , not overpowering , but unmistakably there coupled with strong nutty , oxidized notes . the end result is actually vaguely whisky-like . it tastes like somebody mixed bigfoot barleywine with sandeman oloeroso , in about a 50/50 split . a bridge between the two beer worlds of america and britain . leave it to founders to find a unique twist on an old style . interesting though it may be , i 'm not sure i could see myself buying this again ."

S"pours a mostly clear , copper with a two-finger thick off white head that dissipates to a lingering ring , leaving little lacing behind . aromas of spices ( cinnamon , nutmeg , clove ) , pumpkin pie , light malts , and faint citrus hops . well balanced taste of biscuity pale malts , cinnamon , nutmeg , cloves , and vanilla . the pumpkin is very present but not over-powering . slight bitterness and dry finish . medium mouthfeel , nicely carbonated . this brew is smooth from start to finish , no harsh bite . the abv % is well hidden and only detectable through alcohol warmth , no diacytel or astringent taste/aroma . even though i 'm not a big fan of pumpkin brews , this one definitely stands out amongst the others i 've tried . just a well-made beer ."

S"poured a radiant , crystal-clear golden hue with plenty of bubbles racing to the surface . big , billowing white head with excellent retention . faint but pleasant aroma of grass , citrus and hops . for taste , the front is sweet , tangy , citrusy malts with a dry , hoppy ( but not bitter ) finish that makes you thirsty for more right away . the mouthfeel is crisp , clean and smooth . it 's exceptionally drinkable -- especially on a hot day . very enjoyable on the deck with a big grilled chicken salad ."

S"on nitro-tap @ the king of prussia rock bottom on 11/24/10 . served in an oversized mug . pours black with a finger of frothy and bubbly looking mocha colored head . retains with some very good retention , staying very rich and frothy , while drenching the sides of the glass with sticky creamy lacing . the aroma smells of roasted chocolate malts that are mellowed in the nose by a smooth oatmeal presence . a touch of milky sugars sweeten this up some while some floral and green citric hops sit in the background . the taste is equal parts roasty and sweet , with chocolate and sugars making a definite impression while flaked oats add a tremendously silky feel to the profile . there is a nice amount of balancing earthy bitterness here that hangs with some dryness and spice in the finish . the mouthfeel is medium bodied and is as silky , smooth , and easy feeling as you could possibly want in a beer . the oatmeal just combines with the nitro to give this an unbelievably creamy feel and i ca n't believe how fast i ripped through this big mug of it ! i do n't know that i 've ever considered an oatmeal stout to be refreshing but this one came pretty darn close ! this was just delicious as heck , well balanced , and did i mention how creamy and easy drinking it was ? this beer was excellent and really made my visit on this trip here ."

S"pours a rusty , red brown color with a good amount of haze . very minimal head formation even with a hearty pour . thin lace clings to the glass . the first aroma i noticed was a woody , birch beer like character . there is also a slight smokey element along with caramel candies , licorice , and a full fruitiness . the balance is leaning more towards fermentation character than maltiness , but it still maintains a clean profile . flavor profile is cleaner than the nose , with even less of a malty character than the nose . caramel and toast come through up front , but the finish has a slightly bitter , green , hoppy flavor . carbonation is higher than appearance would suggest , and the finish has a moderate body for the style . the drinkability factor is great . this is a complex , malt forward beer that drinks better than most in it 's category ."

S'appearance : jet black , with a very thin brown head that quickly dissipates nose : reminds me of charcoal , with a touch of liquid smoke taste : lots of roastly malts up front followed by an overwhelming amount of smoke - finishes a bit sweet mf : smooth , good body , a little more carbonation than i like in porters/stouts but very good drinkability : depends on what your doing , definately needs to be paired wisely , would be great with a bacon blue cheese burger , smoked salmon etc notes : i think this would be great to cook with , in fact i poured a bit onto a piece of chicken anda pork chop to marinate , hopefully some of that flavor comes through on them'

S"great name and great little joke going on . however , that 's about all i can say good about this beer . it poured a hazy yellow body ( the only thing that set it aside from the other macros in my mind ) with a white head that disipated rather quickly . the smell and taste where uncomplex and rather boring ( just like american macros ) . the body was thin and watery and was n't as dry as i would of liked for the style . the drinkability might be alright if i just got done mowing the grass or something . like i said great idea and joke . i believe the worse this beer does the funnier the joke is , which adds extra points for me but unfortunately there is no creativity catagory here ."

S"another impressive black ceramic swing-top to add to my collection from the xsperience series , no vintage date but the bier depot knows what they 're doing so i 'd expect this to be an '05 . i poured this in a red wine glass and brought a mini wheel of babybel cheese to keep on standby ... 120 ibu might need some guidance . a- deep dark rich hazy burgundy with plum tones and garnet highlights . 2in soapy tan head settles to 1/8in half-moon ring with lots of sticky icky lace encrusted onto the side of the glass . so resinous it might never wash off . s- citrus grapefruit hops and dark chocolate forever , burnt plum , currant , fig , date , grainy caramel bittersweet malts dark charred wood , spicy black pepper and of course alcohol . a very grapey spirity alcohol like creme de cacao mixed with a fine brandy , for anyone who has ever had a brandy alexander , minus the ice cream and add a crazy amount of hops . roughly 2lbs hops per 1oz liquor : ) t- my palate may not be evolved enough to handle this but here goes ... dark raw cocoa and an insane amount of hops that are wayyy past citrus , almost chemical , concentrated . chewing on the most resinous hop bud around could not be as bitter as this ale . the hops and malt fight briefly for dominance , the hops being the obvious victor . head spinningly resinous and herbal , woody , earthy mushroom , compost , like a mouthful of delicious soil , heavy dark clay from the ohio creekbeds with a hint of currant fruitiness , toasted malt , and alcohol with a cocoa hops aftertaste . mf- perfect . mid-low carbonation , dry yet juicy . the only thing keepin me from chiggin is the mind blowing 120 ibu , and i 'm thankful cuz i could easily see myself laying on the floor twitching if i were to do so . d- so strong , so intense , so raw and gritty , yet so sophisticated and refined . a brew this exceptional should be saved for special occasions . i 'm giving a 3.5 because it should not be consumed easily or massively ... it should be an xsperience ..."

S"22 oz . bomber bottle . it had a silk-screened average looking rectangular pomegranate colored label of the siletz symbol , a man on a boat fishing on a moonlit night trying to vigorously pull his trout ( ? ) out of the water . below the small oval siletz symbol in big yellow cursive letters , is `` oatmeal cream stout . '' below that they say that this beer is made from the finest ingredients , it 's handcrafted in small batches , and it 's a `` true pleasure to relax with . '' we 'll see about that last comment they made . to the right and the left on the main rectangular label is smaller and skinner pomegranate rectangles . the one to the right talks about the brewery and gives the location of siletz brewing . the one to the left gives information about the beer . that 's also where you 'll find the saying that just love to use , `` a true pleasure to relax with . '' in between the to small rectangle labels is that government warning and barcode . this another brewery that does n't like to mark any kind of date on their bottles . i have no idea how old this beer is . appearance : when poured into a samuel smith imperial pint glass , the beer was a roasted coffee bean black with just a small trace of light coming through at the top of the beer . head of foam ? i wish ! i know i poured the beer correctly , but the only thing i got was just a small glimpse of tan foam . that 's was it ! i tried swirling it around , still nothing . it did n't leave any tan colored rings or lace around the glass . basically , it looked like there was just a pint of cold coffee in my pint glass . smell : at least the aroma of this beer was somewhat on the good side . the first aroma that came to me was some quality dark chocolate . that was followed by a pinch of dark roasted malts , a touch of roasted coffee beans , a trace of sweet caramel , a speck of oatmeal , and a shred of bitter northwest hops at the end . i 'm glad that it had some characteristics of a beer , unlike the appearance of it . taste : this beer had the quality of a good oatmeal stout in the beginning , but then the quality went straight down . in the beginning , it had the taste of dark chocolate , a dab of oatmeal , and a trace of dark roasted malts , coffee beans , caramel , and some northwest hops . that was all good , but then this sour acidic taste came over . that last taste just ruined it for me big time"

S"i have toned down my points because i am not sure a beer should taste so much like grape . the beer reminds me very much of a barley wine . it pours a nice color , a very dark purple/black , that closes towards red as you hold it to the light . the smell is entertaining . i sense grape , as i said , i am very much reminded of grape juice . there is something else , chocolate ? i do n't think so , but thats the only other thing coming to mind . so very fruity , the taste matches the smell . there is definitely a high amount of flavor . the bottle boasts a roast malt finish ; i however , can not discern it . the beer feels fine to the palate , small carbonation . there is no `` bottled by '' or `` freshness '' date on the bottle . my only real complaint is that it tastes a little too much like grape juice , or wine . i find it to be sort of a curious ale . i give it low marks for drinkability because it is so much like grape juice or wine . i hesitate to call it a beer drinker 's beer . i can certainly enjoy a pint , but its a beer i can only appreciate in small doses ( relatively , i guess ) , i would n't want to have one followed by another . all in all a good beer ; not a bad pick-up ."

S'pours a full , though lightly hazy , gold color and is topped by a frothy , initially three-finger thick , pale tan colored head . the aroma is a spicy mix of yeast , pear , apple , ginger , pepper , clove , lemon zest , among other things . the aroma is quite nice , fairly complex , yet light & appetizing as a good strong , golden , belgian ale should be . the taste has a light malt sweetness to it that is mostly drowned out by all of the other flavors found in this beer , which is a long way of saying that this beer tastes fairly dry . there is a nice level of yeast/ fermentation derived spiciness here as well ; i get light notes of clove , a certain ginger note , and a pepper-like note that combines with the carbonation . layers of fruit character are also found here with apple and pear being prominent along with a sort of fruit-reminiscent tartness that is also found in these fruits . as the beer warms up a tad , i begin to get some notes of hot alcohol in the finish . it almost adds to the perceived spiciness of this beer , and actually is not all that detracting . this is definitely enjoyable , but something seems a bit out of whack , which keeps this beer from being stellar .'

S"a- pours dark brown with a large beige head . s- brownie batter and hershey 's syrup . t- hershey 's syrup is the biggest flavor , followed by brownie batter and dark fruits ( prunes , raisins ) . m- full bodied , and average carbonation . d- this beer is so sweet , it is ridiculously hard to put down after more than a few sips . i 'm glad i split a bottle with one of my buddies . there is no way i could drink a bottle by myself . overall , an interesting experience . i have never had a beer that resembles chocolate syrup as much as this . not very complex at all ... very focused on the flavors presented . somewhat artificial tasting . it is hard to drink after 3-4 sips . very reminiscent of a desert wine where you really like the first couple sips , but almost detest the rest of the glass due to the sweetness . a hard beer to rate because of this . i am interested/nervous to try their choklat after having this ."

S"on-tap at cbc in late may 2009. served in a teardrop stemware glass . initially served way too cold . my brother and i had to take turns rubbing hands to warm them back up , as we each tried to warm up this single glass . dark brown amber . hazy . 1-finger light tan head , fades to wisps and ring . great curtainous lacing . very fruity aroma . tropical , almost banana peel , plus candied citrus underneath . approaches mint as well . very weird . caramel underneath , but those weird fruity esters and minty phenols really dominate . taste is similarly overwhelmed by the tropical esters and near-banana character . there 's still some detectable citrusy , piney hop , with bold resinous bitterness , plus underlying malt and caramel character . but honestly , these weird esters are just too much . medium body , somewhat smooth , but also lots of resins and astringency . carbonation is moderate , tingly , and helps with body , but also just accentuates those annoying artificially tropical esters . dunno what happened here ..."

S'330ml/11.2 fl oz . bottle , best before 6/2006 . this one poured out a swirl of carbonated bubbles that formed a creamy white head with good retention . the body was cloudy with visible sediments , dark blood-orange like color that pales as it warms . interesting appearance . the smell was strong , gooseberries definitely present , dry and doughy malt aroma also heavy . some wheat/straw presence in the aroma . very rich . the taste is , again , strong berries with some light diacetyl notes . taste of nectarines gives a little tartness . this one was warm and refreshing , light body but not terribly watered down , with slight carbonation in the mouthfeel . also , aftertaste was a bit doughy from the malts , wheat presence resurfaced . i had good expectations for this one , and they were surprisingly met . this is a good brew for all seasons - light and refreshing , with enough body and character to keep your palate interested . recommended .'

S"a- hazy , cloudy , dark orange . an aggressive pour into a pint glass yielded very little head that did not last more than 30 seconds . honestly , it reminds me of a glass of turkey hill iced tea . it did have a decent amount of lace however . s- sweet caramel malty smell . very pleasant . t- sweet malts with just enough hops to add some balance and a little bitterness to the finish . slightly dry finish . m- there was no carbonation at all which made the mouthfeel creamy and smooth . however , it also felt a little watery and on the light side . d- very , very easy to drink . almost to easy . i 'm just not sure if i'im a big fan of the style . at first i could not decide if the mouthfeel was good or bad.i had never had or heard of a keller bier so i deiced to check the description of the style . i found out that the lack of carbonation and smoothness was due to the beer being exposed and matured in deep vaults . based on this , i reviewed the mouthfeel based on the style which i would say this beer captures very well . the only thing i held against it was that it felt a little watery . overall this was a very interesting beer . if you are unfamiliar with the style , i suggest seeking this beer out . it really made me think about what i was tasting while i was drinking and reviewing it . i will be on the lookout for more beers in this style ."

S'appearance : beautiful . copper at the top under a smooth and vibrant foam with a pale straw color towards the bottom of the glass . i like how the light copper slowly turn into the pale straw as my eyes go down the glass . i love how i can see the little carbonation bubbles rising to the top creating a continuous fizzing stream . i love how this beer is pleasing to not only the eye but to the ears as well . smell : grainy with a fruity smell . fruity closer to a naturally sweet lemon if that makes any sense . i think floral with a hint of citrus and background of wheat might be a better description . i can also detect a bit of the alcohol underneath the whole thing , which adds a bit of rich sweetness ot it . taste : i can detect some citrus/lemony notes towards the back of my palate . i can sorta of taste the wheat and grains but they tend to be drowned out by the floral flavor from underneath my tongue . i get a slightly alcoholic after taste . mouthfeel : light carbonation as the beer hits my tongue and continues to nip at it for a while . drinkability : good beer . i think the tripel is well done and a definite inclusion in my rotation despite the steep price for a four pack . i would recommend that people drink this beer at least once to see what the fuss is about . even though some people might not think much of this beer as special , i can definitely say that the tripel has taken beer drinking in a whole new direction .'

S"pours a clear coppery color . 2 fingers of off white head which dissipates quickly leaving a thin sudsy layer . minor lacing . smells like a malt beverage . tastes of roasted malts maybe a little bit of toffee in there . watery finish , unpleasant sweet/malty after taste . medium-low carbonation . pretty mediocre amber ale . kinda feels like you 're drinking a high class malt liquor , which is n't exactly good ."

S"a - okay well ... it 's about as light as a beer can get . very light straw color . s - this is where this beer hits it 's lowest . there is a very strong sour smell . it smells almost completely identical to underarm body odor . t - if you hold your nose , it tastes practically like water . the only taste i get out of it is carbonation and a very slight bitterness . m - as soon as it goes in the mouth , it goes right down . just watery and not much anything left . d - if you can hold your nose while drinking at least the first 3 , then you can get these guys down no problem . overall , it 's a bad beer when it comes to the smell but it 's a great easy drinking beer when it comes to the taste . if you 're very weak to smells , then you might want to pass this one up ."

S'beer purchased at a fancy restaurant , but the server did not swirl the sediment back up into suspension : - this is not the first time i have had the beer , and this time the body seemed thinner . little head & a bit of lacing , though not much were evident . the aroma is not as strong of coriander , citrus and earthiness as i remember it , but it was there and enjoyable . the body seems lighter and should be a bit thicker , and the carbonation was much lower than i want it ( and recollect it ) . nevertheless an excellent wit to drink .'

S"poured a perfect golden with a fluffy , white as snow head . aroma did nothing for me . hints of kelp baking in the sun mingled with the all-too-familiar european hops gone bad due to photons getting through a green bottle . taste was grassy and organic , dry finish , ok mouthfeel . i 'm sure this is fairly sublime when not skunked , but i wo n't know from this bottle . still it carried itself well for all the abuse by light ... i wo n't seek out any more bottles of this , but will most definitely sample it on tap if i ever find it . i ca n't get past the odd smell , it keeps reminding me of the sea grass that washes up in the florida keys and just bakes into an warm , herbal salty aroma . regional pilsners in appropriate brown bottles do a lot more for me ."

S"on tap at cbc on 3/12/11 and served in a flute . this brew appears a very hazed dark brown color with some lighter brown coloration and clarity through the edges . a thin tan cap dissolves quickly and hangs close with a formation of bubbles around the wall of the glass . the smell of this brew is quite tangy with mellow tones of woodsy smoothness . a vanilla scent creeps in with a sweet smell that is quite enjoyable . more sniffs of this brew reveal a spiced aspect and more sweetness somewhat like brown sugar . wow , the smell of this brew is an absolute contradiction of what the taste reveals . the taste of this brew is tangy , sharp , acidic and sour with a bold incorporation of alcohol . the alcohol is well incorporated and not distracting but it 's evaporative quality only sharpens the perceived acidity and sourness of this brew . some woodsy notes and vanilla smoothness is evident as this brew rolls across the tongue but it is quickly met with an acute sharpness of sourness and acidity . further sips reveal malt notes that are minorly chocolate-like that get dominates by the strong tangy sourness and acidity of this brew . this offering displays a huge salivation factor . it is medium bodied and lightly carbonated . this brew is not an easy drinker , there is a reason you are served less than 10oz . the alcohol is not hidden at all . this is a very pungent brew with seemingly no funk , just straight brutal sourness . overall it was enjoyable but it took some effort to put down . i 'm not a sourhead but i enjoy a good sour brew from time to time and on this occasion i was really in the mood for one . to quote my wife on this experience : `` are you feeling ok ? i do n't think i 've ever seen you only drink one beer and have it last this long in your glass .

S"my recent discovery that i do n't like munich malts sheds a lot of light on my rating for this brew . looks like cola , transparent but deep mahogany brown . very little cola like head quickly dies to a smear of frothy film . sweet , slight rotten and roasted malty notes in the nose . some coffee bitter malt followed by a sweet biscuity maltness . very light hop profile overpowered by more bitter malt . moderate to light body and delicate carbonation . i picked this sixer up purely becauase i do n't know if i will be able to buy this beer ever again . i 'm glad i tried it , but i did give the last five bottles and the case away to a friend who collects six-packs . they were n't worth drinking by my standards and i 'm pretty sure four of these bottles will make it into his collection with the top on . i 'm glad to have this bottle in my collection , but i wo n't drink this beer again ."

S"served on tap in 10 fl.oz . snifter glass , ( november 24 , 2009 ) . eyes : black as night . a small yet thick , dirty-tinted foam floats on top . nose : a potent bourbon aroma strikes first . there is also a nice oak smell , hints of chocolate and vanilla . tongue : happily the taste is very alike the aroma . the bourbon is strong , as are the other pieces ; oak , chocolate , and vanilla . the only down side is that the alcohol is a bit too pronounced . mouth : rich , thick and sticks to the palate . libation : a fantastic piece of brewing , the bourbon flavor is well married with a smooth stout beer . i ca n't say this is exactly `` drinkable '' as the intense bourbon body and 13 % abv combine for a glass one needs to nurse for a while . i took a good 45 minutes for just 10 ounces . i think this will age very well , so i 'll be putting a couple bottles away to give away as christmas gifts next year . this is certainly a beer that only a quality craft brewer could produce . good on goose island for putting out such fine stuff ."

S'appearance - a sunset orange-colored beer with a sticky cream-colored head . lots of stick to the foam as it falls back . aroma - an opening hint of grapefruit and pine , fading rapidly . some notes of sweetish grain and metal , not near what i expected or hoped for . taste - biscuity grain opening , overtaken quickly by the onslaught of highly bitter hops . medicinal , harsh , acrid , too much ! so intense , that while i pick up nuances of citrus , any subtleties are blown away by sheer alpha acids . working through this is a bit of a chore , even with some lasagna and garlic bread . ultimately , not that enjoyable . mouthfeel - decent smoothness , a solid body , and with a moderate carbonation level . drinkability - too bitter for me ; i would not buy this again , however , those of you into hardcore bitterness may want to check this one out .'

S"i sampled this on a recent trip to blackfriars in glasgow . the beer poured a very dark brown colour with a decent off white head , pretty normal for a pint of mild . the nose was dominated by roasted malts and chocolate with a slight hint of spiciness . the beer drank like a mild should , light on the mouth but i was surprised that this actually had some more tastes going on than a standard pint of this style . the malts and chocolate came through from the nose and this was followed by an aftertaste of spices that left a dry finish . a very pleasant beer that was topped off by it 's drinkability a light bodied beer ideal for a hot summers day , this was so pleasant that we stayed in the bar for a few more pints ."

( 1/19/09 - a rather hazy ruby this time , from a well-rested bottle , so quite a range is possible ) aroma - sweet , dark fruit ( dark red cherries obviously , like bing cherries ) , deeply rich smelling with an easily detectable alcohol smell . not very intense , but foreboding , maybe . taste - tart cherry , a little nuttiness picked up on top of some thick maltiness . and did i mention some alcohol ? crikey , you could serve this in a shot glass . very strong in that department . lots of bubbles help usher in some lambic funkiness , a bit subdued and a good idea for this beer . ends rather sour , almost acrid , like cherry vicks 44d , but not entirely unpleasant . overall , an interesting but very boozy tasting beer . some elements kick up the score but a few other elements knock it back down imo . mouthfeel - very alive with bubbles , they fill the mouth with foam at times if you take a good swig . good body and a very warm residue . drinkability - a decent beer but not really repeatable . a beer tasting kind of thing or an alternative way to wind down a busy day instead of wine ."

S'this beer poured a red/orangish color with a huge fluffy off white head that took forever to settle down . the head was so fluffy and creamy that i could draw in it . the smell was mildly spicy with a beefy sweetness . subtle hops were noticable . the taste was very mild with spices very discrete . a tasty brew but very low key , it could be kicked up a notch . this left you very dry afterwards . the mouthfeel was meaty and chewy with just enough carbonation . very nice . a very drinkable brew , very mild and low key but tasty .'

S'poured copper with a thin and short lasting tan head . not much head retention . copper color had a nice look to it though . smell had caramel , toffee , hints of chocolate , scotch and various fruits . aroma reminded me of a porter . a little weak . taste was quite smooth but had an alcoholic bit to it . the hints of chocolate came through quite nicely in my opinion . basically the taste started out very promising but then went down hill because it lacked dimensions . mouthfeel was solid but a bit watery . drinkability was kind of shaky . the aftertaste made my throat very dry the other night . that is why i have to deduct for drinkablity . drink a lot of water if you try this .'

S"my first bell 's pale ale . i never tried their regular pale ale just because i could n't get past the stouts and porters , they were just too good to pass up ! i 'm glad i tried the two-hearted though . a good pouring beer , decent head that disappears in about a minute , leaving a nicely scented lace . the smell is fantastic , just like opening up that bag of whole leaf for the brewpot . the hops are the showcase here , and they tend to dominate the malt with little interplay between the two . i like my ipa drinkable , more of a spring/summer drink than a cold winter night drink . ( except of course for dogfish 90-minute ! ) this beer would be perfect for mowing the lawn or doing yard work . nice and light ( for bell 's anyway . ) it 's worth buying a six-pack if you 're a hophead , because if you 're like me , you would easily drink a lot of this beer . have fun !"

S"i picked up a 4 pack for $ 9.49 at woodman 's . this beer pours a cloudy light golden/straw color with a creamy white head that left a decent lace . the aroma is an off the chart spicy , floral hop aroma , it smells like a handful of hallertau hops ! the nose also has a moderate sweetness and a moderate , soft maltyness . the flavor is up front , in your face , highly spicy hop flavor with moderate sweetness and a warm alcohol presence , especially at the swallow . the bitterness is medium-high and the beer finishes with a spicy hop flavor all over the mouth . carbonation is moderate as was the body . overall this was very good , but for the price i do n't think i would buy it again , but it is worth trying . the aroma was amazing , nothing short . the flavor was good , but the finish was a bit too much for my preference , even for an imperial pils ."

S'12oz bottle , i gather from 2009 . pours dark brown with crimson edging and a thin , partial head of tan . a few whisps of foam and better lacing throughout the glass . aromatics lead off with a blast of nutmeg , cinnamon , cloves , and spiced rum . somewhere between a glazed ham studded with cloves or a pumpkin pie , maybe both . hints of chocolate and smoke follow through . medium bodied with a soft , creamy mouthfeel . brown sugar and an onslaught of pungent spice starts the palate . heavy on the nutmeg , with cinnamon , cloves , cardamon , anise , and menthol . chocolate , dark caramel , and sweet malt follow through . finishes with ever-lingering holiday spice , loads of residuals and mild booze . whoa ... way too spicy and sweet for me . not to mention this is supposed to be an imperial stout ? lacking much stout character . more akin to an spiced up old ale or perhaps approaching porter territory . interesting , but finishing this one will be a bit of a chore .'

S"woah ! hops . look out ... a : poured out of the bottle into my glass , i 'd call it brown when the lights are out . pretty robust looking , with a dark tan frothy head and a good deal of lacing on the glass . s : yeah , wow . hops are overwhelming here . extraordinary how evident they are , even having expected a hoppy beer with the whole `` imperial porter '' title . floral hops perhaps , pretty pleasant . i struggle to find more , but you can definitely pick up on the malts , roasted or smoked , i ca n't tell . maybe dried fruit . slightly sweet . overall , the hops dominate . t : hops . bitterness hits right away . very robust though , and as opposed to the smell you get more of the malty goodness ; bready , smoked maltiness . the malt traits that are present are very , very nice . dried fruit sweetness for sure . very smooth , and there 's some sort of acidic quality that leads me to wonder if they incorporated any stale ales or old ales like the porters of old . i 'm actually really liking it on the whole though . balance does n't seem to be a consideration , so if you 're against really hoppy beers , this may not please you . and i 'm just not sure the hardcore hoppiness really goes with the style . i 'd also note that , despite almost 10 % abv , i 'd have to try real hard to pick up on the alcoholic qualities of this beer . m : medium to full bodied , but very creamy , smooth , and certainly a bit dry . not much in the way of a bite from carbonation . d : i used to say i hated the hardcore hoppy thing of many craft brewers , but i 've really been coming around to it with further consideration , and while this beer is quite hoppy , i 'm still really enjoying it . the malt characters that are there are very nice . that said , almost 10 % and pretty heavy , so while i 'd gladly take a pint , but i ca n't see it being a beer you 'd have more than once or twice in a night.though . plus , if you do n't like hops , this ai n't for you . so it 's low on the drinkability scale ..."

S"ca n't figure out the freshness date . thanks joe for the pour . the color is dark brown with a tan-white head that recedes to a lace and then almost nothing . the aroma has a nice , light fruitiness and a subtle , diluted coffee character . there are also slight aromas of vanilla and nuts . everything is subtle here , but nice . medium bodied on the palate with good carbonation . the taste is on the sweet side with subtle notes of vanilla . the bitterness seems to be in harmony with the coffee , and i 'm guessing that 's where most of it is from . the coffee is far from the most pronounced i 've had in a coffee porter , but it seems to be the main flavor component here . the porter characteristics seems to be in the background and are very subtle . i liked this beer . i 'm not sure if i 'll get it at this price point because of the other coffee beers available , but it was nice to try ."

S"pours a deep black with mocha head . faint hint of malt and chocolate in the nose , but nothing astounding . decent lacing . the taste is decent , although i do not consider it a traditional russian imperial stout . thin body . notes of roasted malts , coffee , and chocolate . long story short , this is actually a session ris if i ever did come across one . to use simile , it was like a size 8 woman in a full-figured woman 's clothing . i am going to be able to polish this off all by myself without any problems . it might be better to continue marketing it as a winter stout rather than a ris . or i have a serious drinking problem . certainly not bad -- i did enjoy drinking it . however , a bit more body and forward flavors would round out the profile for the style . this might go well with a grilled steak . it might also be good material for a sauce reduction to use on various red meats ."

S'i had this at a mexican restaurant yesterday and after years of enjoying this , largely from a bottle , i have to give it some benefit of the doubt in my review , because this sample was a bit disappointing . although it looked its usual beauteous deep copper color , the head was a bit thin on this one , modest lace . the aroma was also very thin and barely suggested some wheat perhaps but not much else . the head died pretty quickly and with the first swig i was surprised at how lifeless this was . not quite flat officially but definitely not what i have come to expect . there is a light carmel flavor but i also got a slight metal detector reading . there is a fine carbonation though it is not too powerful . there is some sweet wheat noted but overall i was disappointed in this on tap . by the bottle it is almost always a winner and a great choice with heavy food like you might typically have at a tex/mex restaurant . i will have to review a bottle to help even up the score here .'

S"i was really excited about this one ; i was aware that mill street often had a seasonal wit on tap in their brew-pub , but did n't find out that they 'd begun bottling it until a friend mentioned it . i made a trip to the lcbo right away . not only is mill street one of my favourite brewers , but the wit-bier style is very high on my list of favourites , especially during such a brutal summer . mill street wit poured from the cool mill street brown bottle ( silk-screened , uniquely shaped , with a pop cap ) into my weizen glass as you might expect - lots of visible effervescence , a big cap , and a cloudy-hazy yellow body . the colour was a bit lager-y ( slightly orange-y ? ) for a wit , and the head was n't quite as frothy as you would expect from the style , but the beer still looks absolutely delicious . the head dies down a bit after a few moments , to about one finger , where it lasts for the rest of the drink , accompanied by very heavy lacing . not the best looking wit i 've tried , but respectable , and tempting . the smell is gorgeous . dominated by orange , clove , coriander . a hint of bananas . a slight , musty wheatiness . yeast . not as strong of a scent as the other wits that i 've tried , but it has a nice , crisp freshness to it that hoegaarden and blanche de chambly seem to lack . the taste lives up to the smell . big banana and curaco orange at front , accented by a very nice wheat body . subtle coriander and clove , a hint of bubblegum ( not too much ) . sweet initially , but dries - well balanced , and simply delicious . again , this does n't have the 'hit you over the head ' big flavour of other wits , but where it lacks there , it more than compensates with the fact that it 's simply so fresh , crisp , and clean . a bit of orange-banana bubblegum with a hint of yeast and wheat on the finish . the mouthfeel is also great ; obviously the carbonation is big , because of the style . but the body feels simply great in the mouth , and the heavy carbonation is almost unnoticeable because of the rich taste and lovely freshness . drinkability - as with most wits and hefes - is outstanding . i could drink most all night , and this is no exception . for me , mill street 's wit is far and away the definitive canadian interpretation of the witbier . it simply blows unibroue 's blanche de chambly out of the water , and it holds its own against canadian wheat beers of any style"

S"from it 's attractive ( yet clear . . . ) bottle , this `` fruity scottish beer '' ( i 'm sorry but , lol ! ) pours a light amber blonde colour with a decently creamy 2 finger white head that dissipates to a decently thick film and leaves some decent lacing on my snifter . smell is pure skunk right away . upon closer inspection , behind the skunk i pick up some subtle caramel and grain notes with a touch of grassy hops . when you really try hard , you can , indeed , pick out some subtle notes of vanilla in there . it does have some nice candied fruit flavours going on up front with the vanilla from the oak coming through mostly on the finish , complemented by big notes of california chardonnay-esque butter and subtle hints of chocolate and smoke notes on the linger ( these being very common to american oak-aged beverages ) . otherwise , i get some rich caramel notes with some hints of bread , spice and grain in there as well . the alcohol , while not very high , does make its presence felt - a bit too much in my honest opinion . mouthfeel is medium bodied and it has quite an oily texture . the finish is also quite oily leaving a similar mouthfeel to , again , a classic california oaked chardonnay . drinkability , i feel , is not one of this beer`s strengths . it`s a bit too heavy on the alcohol flavour and the strong flavours form the oak make it much more of a sipper . i should say that i am impressed how much of the oak flavour they were able to get into this brew . it does offer some pretty interesting flavours that would impress any wine-geek too . i enjoyed this brew but i , that said , i won`t be rushing back for more ."

S"black . or is it dark brown ? ruby-ish ? i ca n't tell , but it 's nice . however , there 's no lace , but more importantly , there is no head no matter hard i swirl the glass . come to think of it , it looks like black coffee . smells like fresh brewed coffee , and i mean fresh . cafe macchiato with a hint of hazelnut . bitter chocolate and earthy hops make a minor appearance . nice blend of the coffee flavors with the roasted malts . a little one dimensional , but the dude abides . subtle sweet finish . pretty lush body for a porter , a win . great for a coffee beer fix , but not a regular purchase ."

S'appearance : bottle wrapped in paper . pours an orangish amber at first with a thick foam of small tight bubbles . this head grew as it sat in my glass . there are quite a few floaters present , even in the first glass i poured . the beer is a very clear deep brown with a lot of bubbles rising . aroma : it definitely has a winy aroma to it . there is some noticeable wood present that almost borders between oxidation and sherry to the nose . once the head falls a bit to let you actually smell what the liquid is like , it gains a black cherry and plum character . as it warms further there is a distinct leathery note coming out . taste : there is a lot going on in the flavor ! it is really earthy . you can pick out the graininess along with the wood character in particular . there is a definite sour note to it that is balanced by a healthy caramel presence . the finish is sweet and sour , but the end leaves your throat feeling dry and slightly acidic with a bunch of fizz to linger . opinion : this is a really nice beer ! this one is superbly balanced between the tart and sweet . only because it has a bit of an acidic note do i score it a bit lower on the drinkability . this is because i was ready for a glass of water after finishing this one . still a world class beer , and one not to miss !'

S"a very enjoyable beer overall . this beer is absolutely jet black . american string ale ? maybe american strong stout is a better description , even the nose smells like a stout with roasted malt smell and a slight herbal hop aroma . a bit hoppier in aroma than a typical stout , but this is no ipa in that regard . the taste is heavy on the roasted and black malts , with a choclatey sweetness underneath it all . at over 7 % there is n't really any burn , but it definitely smacks of charcoal on the finish . it 's pleasant for a while , but the acrid bitterness on the finish gets pretty old ."

S"i should start with full disclosure : belgian ales are not my favorite style of beer . however , it 's one of the best ones of style i 've had . paradoxically , i suspect what makes me like it could lead those who like belgian ales to dislike it . it pours a very thin , loose white head which dissipates almost immediately , and a rich gold color representative of the style . carbonation is minimal . smell is like most belgians with a little bit of a clove aroma . however , the taste is surprisingly mild for a belgian , and clove taste is minimal . mouthfeel is pleasingly thick . the big problem i usually have with belgians is the strong , lingering aftertaste . that 's not the case here . there 's little aftertaste , so drinkability is extraordinary for this style of beer . other than surly cynic ale and a belgian/ipa called hopit ( i forget the brewery ) , this is about the only belgian i 'd buy again ."

S"not much impressed . cloudy straw colored ale with an active frothy head of pure whit . smells of grass yeast and alcohol . i think this may be the worst tripel i 've had yet . sweet and some fruitiness followed by a hint of sourness and some bitterness that i did not like at all . moderately light body and foamy carbonation . any beer this strong needs to taste better to be worth drinking again ."

S"had this on-tap at the brewpub - served in a weizen glass . a - carefully poured to only have one finger of creamy white foam - i appreciate the nearly full glass , but also respect the excellent retention of what is there . the body is a transparent golden straw color with a few stray slow-moving bubbles moving through it . as i work through the glass , some splotchy lace is left behind . s - toasted grains and steamed rice . a touch of light citrus that 's a little sweeter than the lemon mentioned on the menu . there 's a bit of pungent spice tool . pleasant , but understated . t - cereal grains - like puffed rice . finishes with a bit of tangerine and mild bitterness , compliments of the sorachi ace . there is a fruity character the emerges from the malt backbone . the aftertaste is a little evocative of `` generic beer '' , but thankfully there is only a touch of this . an peculiar mix of rice lager and american pale ale that is quite enjoyable . m - soft , but lively carbonation . light , crisp , refreshing , with only a faint residual stickiness . very clean . d - reminds me a little of half acre gossamer , but i actually like this quite a bit more as the aftertaste is better . very flavorful for 4 % - love the sorachi ace . i would have grabbed a growler if any had been in stock ( weird ontario laws proscribe that they must be pre-filled ) . this would be a superb beer to have as your session option , and i think macro lovers could appreciate it as well ."

S"picked up this 24 ouncer at monument in concord for $ 3 . served in a firestone nonic and first tasted ~10 minutes out of the fridge . pours a gorgeous darkish golden amber with a foamy two-finger-thick off-white head . decent retention , but it dissipates to a chunky light cover after about five minutes . light lacing remains as i drink this one down . nose is woodsy and malty , with a nice balance of hop character . it 's sweet , with a hint of alcohol . i also get a vegetable-like presence that i ca n't nail . seems like a good variety of hops are at work here , as its unlike any other ipa i 've had . spices and caramel maltiness , combine with that leafy green presence found in the nose to create a very interesting ipa . body is right in the middle , but the big carbonation makes for a lighter and hugely drinkable beer . alcohol is noticeable considering the relatively low abv . yet another very tasty offering from the guys at sierra nevada . i 'll seek this one out again , especially at this great price ."

S'a : clear , golden straw color with a soapy , 3-finger head that quickly dissipates leaving a thin cap . not much carbonation noticeable once the head settles . s : yeasty , lager like qualities . a clean floral hop presence . not much else . t/m : clean , easy-drinking , with a decent hop crispness . a little on the thin side . slight bit of underlying sweetness from the pale malt . soft carbonation tingles during the sip , but leaves as quickly as the short , dry finish . d/o : a decent summertime refresher , but nothing too terribly interesting going on . would work well with a variety of summer foods . probably good at parties with non-craft beer drinkers , but there are better options out there in the style .'

S"with almost no head to speak of , this beverage is more mud-brown than pumpkin-orange . hardly translucent , it 's more like a real brown ale -- does the darkness indicate imperialism ? the relatively dark tinge on an 8 % imperial makes me uneasy . the most pronounced aroma is nutmeg . the cloves are there as well . even the cardamom reveals its presence in the nose . maybe it 's the influx of these powerful spices that provoked such worry from the look . i 'm not sure how this will manifest in taste , but the spice basket smells like , well , a spice basket . perhaps this one 's imperialism relates more to its fancy assembly of spices than the ethanol it offers . it tastes strong as in spicy , and literally spicy as opposed to more commonly spicy hot . it 's imperial because you can envision sailors commissioned by royalty traveling proudly to return the spices that compose this beer . it 's incredibly unique , but it 's the most uncomfortably close i 've come to eating a potpourri bag . now , as i smell before i taste , i 'm almost fearful . the beer is thick and indeed powerful , but more like syrup than adult beverage . there 's little balance to the spiciness that is this pumpkin beer . the mouthfeel is like sensory overload . trying to feel all that you smell is taxing . it leaves my cheeks worn out . halfway through my 12oz pour , finishing seems a daunting task . though `` awful '' would be an unfair label , this serving may prove too much ."

S"in the style of ebert & roper this is a two-man review . the idea being that two peoples opinions playing off one another might give you a good idea of where your own thoughts would end up . me : this is a schwarz bier ! german for black beer . the black only refers to color though , it 's not going to be super heavy . also unlike porters and stouts the bitterness comes from hops instead of roasting the malts . me : it 's also got a freshness date , which i wish more beers did . me : mine 's best by august . him : mine says best purchased before may . him : im glad i made the cut ! me : you make no cuts . you are picked last for the kickball team . me : interesting that mine says `` enjoy by '' and not `` purchase by '' like yours . him : im reading the label and it looks like we should expect caramel and chocolate malts . him : it also says it is lightly hopped . me : that goes somewhat against the schwarz bier description . him : people this is why we do these reviews ... to find out who is lying and actually get down to what this beer is like . me : im so editing that out . me : ok pour ! im using a pint glass . him : same . him : theres a smell , but im not sure i like it . me : i quite enjoy . kind of a smoky chocolate . him : i smell some caramel too . me : i get a bit of a bark smell also . him : the head was small and is now gone after sitting for a couple minutes . him : its very dark , pretty much the color of cola . him : this is definitely a beer we could trick our non-drinking friends into drinking . me : except i do n't see any signs of carbonation . me : it looks good though . i ended up with more head than you did . him : look on the top , there are a lot of bubbles rising to the surface . me : i ca n't see the top because of the head actually . me : i was holding it up to the light though , got a bit of a ruby highlight and no bubbles . him : so ! if you get a lot of head like he does you wont see bubbles , but if you get no head like i do , you will see bubbles . me : ( laughs ) stop talking to the audience . im editing you all out ! me : ready to drink ? him : when am i not ? him : i definitely taste chocolate and"

S"man , looking at these other 2 reviews i wonder if i did n't get a bad mix or batch . it was a very visually striking beer with it 's pale pink color and it smelled very interesting with a mix of watermelon , citrus and a hint of corinader , but i found it to taste just awful . it just did n't seem to come together very well and ended up reminding me rotting watermelon . i really wanted to like this , but there was just no way , could n't even finish off the tasting glass . but with the all right reviews it has gotten i will have to go back and do some more `` research '' . i guess that means another trip to the great dane for hours more research ! !"

S'the closest beer i recall that tastes almost exactly like water . although this may increase its drinkability score , no other positive qualities could be found . appeared almost like water with a few squeezes of lemon . no head or carbonation . first time i have had a japanese beer and i hope this will not deter me from trying a few others .'

S"paid $ 1.59 for a single ... the beer pours a hazy golden base , medium white head , minimal retention and no lacing on the glass . the smell is contains a hint of malt . the taste is rather bland , very light hefe with a touch of malt and fruit tones . pretty nice on the palette but with low retention could be much smoother . it 's drinkable if it were a light beer , but it is n't , not impressed given the style . final thought : i wanted a hefe and got a poor excuse for one . thumbs down !"

S"this example was an 03 that i 've aged about 2 years . served in a tulip glass . appearance is a super dark copper orange . absolutely no head to speak of . just a mild foam during the pour which was gone almost immediately . smell is sweet . raisin like , malty with a hint of soy sauce taste is sweet dried fruits up front . raisins and figs . this gives way to an intense piney hoppy bitterness . big citrus rind flavor that curls your lips . some hot alcohol vapors on the exhale . mouthfeel is heavy . slight carbonation . thick . drinkability is a hard one . i love the taste , but at over 11 % not easy to give a high rating . overall an intense barley wine . in my opinion not quite as accessible as say a big foot . but , definitely more extreme ."

S"pours a whiskey brown with a small , dark head . this beer reminded of bourbon more than any other beer i 've tried . it is also similar to an imperial stout in a lot of aspects ( except for the appearance ) . the smell was of bourbon barrel vanilla and chocolate . the taste was similar , with strong alcohol that warmed as it went down . drinkability was average . i doubt i would ever be able to finish an entire bottle of it or want more than 2 full drinks ."

S"weird , if i recognize that section of floor and wall , i uploaded the picture for this beer but never reviewed it . anyway ... appearance : gold bullion , crystal-clear yellow lager body with a tall , rough , spittly , and ultimately unimpressive white head . smell : very aromatic from the hops used , herbal and floral - reminiscent of lavender - with a slight citric edge , like lemongrass . the spice is rooted in a lightly caramelized pale malt base that provides notes of white wine and bread . taste : balanced but noticeably hoppy , not in a too-bitter or aggressive way , but simply a flavorful way . very peppery , with a heather/rosemary herbal/floral tone and a soapy citric tang . malts are quite simple , sweet and biscuity . mouthfeel : light , of course , but not without some sticky thickness . carbonation is bright and the finish is clean . well-suited to the flavor . drinkability : i was unimpressed with this beer the first time i had it , but i 've enjoyed it more and more every time i 've had it since then . now that i 'm actually sitting down to focus on it , i am really quite impressed with the nuanced hop flavor here . not your average fizzy yellow japanese lager . refreshing , yes , but also rather captivating ."

S"i am not pouring this in a glass . rather , i am drinking it out of the can since it is one of the few beers i will drink in a can . a - from what i can see , extremely dark black with a small brown head retention . obviously pouring this in a glass would make a difference . s - lots of caramel and toffee . subtle chocolate . t - lots of smoke flavors . this could be quite hot on the palate depending on how experienced you are with russian imperial stouts ( as in alcohol taste ) . very creamy and toasty . obviously an abundance of malt . sip and enjoy this winter time brew . m - thick with an oatmeal stout mouthfeel . i would n't be surprised if this were an imperial oatmeal stout . i hope rasputin does n't scoff at me . d - two pints is quite enough . three or more is asking for a rather harsh morning , so you better have time to sleep in . this is a great beer regardless . overall , a great winter time russian imperial stout . this is my go-to stout during the winter when i am out and about . dark lord and hunahpuhs are obviously gods of the stout genre , but they are extremely limited , obviously . if it is november through february , chances are i am drinking ten fidy if i am drinking stout ."

S'ruby chestnut hue , with a light haze . initially thick head readily recedes into a thin , meager beige ring . the aroma is a stately melange of singed biscuit and carob , accompanied by mild earthy hops and mellow toffee . understated figgish esters and butterscotch surface as it breathes . agreeably well rounded aromawise . judicious dark brown sugar - like sweetness bathes the palate incipientally in flavor ; it is promptly complemented by a partially drying combination of grainy , crumbly , lightly salted biscuit and well integrated , calm hop bitterness . earthy , tracely woody hop tones emerge mid palate concomitantly with subtle notes of buttery chocolate to lend a subtle , but relishable impression of fresh pipe tobacco . lightly bodied , but appropriate and well matched to malt character in its softly dextrinous mouthfeel . finishes trim and mostly dry , with a transient snap of dried date sweetness yielding to quickly fleeting notes of faintly buttery oak . although ashen in hop presence and simple in its malt profile , old brown dog exhibits sufficient depth of overall character to both satiate and tease the palate for more . superlatively drinkable .'

S"friend of mine brought over a sixer and left three of them so i thought i 'd try one . nothing going on in the appearance world , looks like miller lite , pretty clear . little to no head that hardly exists even briefly . nothing going on in the smell department at all . smells sweet and maybe slightly limey . taste ? lol . calling this a beer is certainly a stretch . whatever little lime odor there was is not evident in the taste of the beer . instead it is just generically fruity , as if you had poured a little fountain fruit punch into a beer . there is a strange bitterness that is apparent only at the sides of the mouth/tongue . not much of an aftertaste at all . it feels in the mouth much like , say , pellegrino would except slightly more carbonated . i 've seen the word `` thin '' thrown around a lot in these reviews and that 's exactly the word for it . it 's actually pretty drinkable all things considered . it 's not how i want my beer to taste at all but if you were blind-tasting it among sodas and fruity drinks , you 'd probably think it was pretty good . i wo n't ever be buying this beer but might go for one in the future at say a barbecue if all that 's offered is corona and this ."

S"on tap at max 's in baltimore the other day . the beer pours the expected black as night imperial stout color , with a chocolate/coffee color head . however , retention was surprisingly short lived , and lacing was pretty minimal . on the nose one gets a huge aroma of chocolate , coffee and vanilla , as well as almost some sort of woodiness . in any event , the beer smells very impressive . the flavors on the palate pretty much replicate the nose , but are a bit more complex . there is also an aged sherry flavor to this beer , along with some more chocolate , licorise and even drambuie . very , very impressive . this beer is really a mouthful ; there is a huge presence in the mouth , no doubt at least partially attributable to the 13 % plus abv . in fact , if there is any knock at all on this beer , it 's that the abv . really wears on you after a while . the beer is very , very boozy , and towards the end i struggled to finish my 10 ounce goblet . the beer is ultimately a bit heavy and tiring on the palate , though the outstanding flavor keeps me going ... . albeit pretty slowly . nevertheless , this beer is pretty sweet and boozy , which detracts from it 's drinkability . there 's enough of a hop presence to keep the beer from tasting syrupy , but it 's still pretty rich and heavy . an impressive beer , but a little bit of this goes a long way . not sure it 's quite ready for the ris sweepstakes , as in my opinion , it still takes a back seat to beers like dark lord , kbs and the abyss . still , an interesting effort from weyerbacher ."

S"2010 batch , poured in a duvel tulip being a lover of imperial stouts and having read about this beer for going on 2 years now , i was excited enough to see it in my local shop to ignore the $ 22/4pk price and pick some up . i also knew going in that i was probably going to hate the first bottle and would have to age the other 3 for at least a year before trying again . that is exactly what happened . fresh , this beer is a big , hot , bourbon-y mess . it is like someone spilled quite a lot of bourbon into my delicious imperial stout . now i do n't hate bourbon . i will drink it on occasion . i just do n't love it either . a splash of bourbon would be wonderful ; subtle , hinting on the nose and the finish . the amount here overwhelms . i literally had to cover my glass with a coaster while not drinking because it smelled like a bourbon spill in the living room . i drank maybe 1/3 of the bottle over 2 hours and eventually gave up and poured $ 4 worth of beer down the drain . anyway : the beer is quite nice to look at , black with dark tan head , but it is n't really any nicer than any of the other impy stouts i 've tasted . the smell is like a glass of bourbon in front of you and they guy next to you has a glass of really roasty stout . powerfully boozy and frankly unpleasant . the taste was 7/10 awful and 3/10 delicious . i had some 2010 night stalker the night before and was amazed that an 11.7 % beer hid it 's alcohol so well . this was the same in some ways but also quite different . the actual alcohol was not very present , it warmed a bit but did not burn like one would expect from a 13 % beer . on the other hand , the main flavor of this beer is bourbon and tastes very alcoholic . it sort of has the taste of alcohol without the feel of alcohol . i clearly do n't really know how to explain it . once the booze hit passes , a delicious roasty , almost chocolatey undertone shines through before being swallowed up by the still bourbon-y aftertaste . i can see what this beer wants to be , what it can and will be with some years on it . there is an amazing stout underneath all of that over-the-top bourbon character . is it so wrong to want my beer to taste of beer and my liquor to taste of liquor ? the mouthfeel is exactly what i want from an imperial stout , viscous and coating , oily and velvety . spot on . as for drinkability , well"

S'this stuff is expensive and also has the curse of the 11.2 oz bottles . a- pale golden with white head that was seriously gone before i raised it to my lips . s- vanilla and hops t- same as smell , but has a really dry vanilla finish m- medium but okay at the same time . d- an example why imports are over rated . basically a cheap version vanilla version of blue moon . i wasted 40 bucks on 11.2 oz bottles of cheap crap !'

S"** pre-review note : i was given this beer blind and my comments reflect my intrinsic enjoyment of the beer . scores have been scaled down to reflect the fact that this really is n't a very good `` imperial stout '' - either stylistically or just philosophically , regardless of how much liberty they took with guidelines ** pours a dark brown colour with a red tinge . head is lovely and dense , a finger thick with large bubbles . lace is also beautifully dense and sticky . looks seductive and impressive . smell is rich and tart . lots of dark berry notes with heavy plum and raisin and blackberry notes . plus well , wow , it 's just red wine-esque . lots of shiraz plus large amount of black pepper , oak , cocoa hints as well . pretty appealing . taste is quite dark and complex . much dark fruit on the assault , plummy and jammy with hints of raisins and redcurrants . gets very vinous midway with red grape skins , dark chocolate and black pepper like you 'd get from a good barossa shiraz . yeah , very intriguing and unique flavours , lots of spice and really quite tart . nutty and oaky notes come through on the back . in fact i think a lot of the vinous notes i 'm sensing are just pungent oak . distinct funk from the same source i believe , sort of a washed-rind cheese character blends with the fruity tart notes very well . very tasty and complex ; i 'm definitely feeling it . smooth mouthfeel but with an alacrity to it ; it just pops and leaps around in the mouth , very nicely . a very enjoyable and complex brew . challenging but balanced . a sipper , but a bloody fine sipper ."

S"light gold color , smallish fluffy white head , a bit hazy . smell was very muted and i had difficulty to pick up aromas . taste was a bit on the light side , soft biscuity malt , lots of `` belgian '' spice character , clove ? lighter mouthfeel made this very drinkable . hop character took a major back seat to the belgian spice . slight grassy hay like hop dryness towards the end . the lighter malt character really allowed the yeast characteristics to leap to the front . very drinkable summer style brew ."

S"a dark copper color , this beer looks not too bad . the tan head says bye-bye quickly and leaves a disappointing still surface . the smell is faint roasted grains . the taste is bad . it tastes of malt and dirt mixed ; it 's dusty and leaves a metallic , unpleasant aftertaste . it 's got something of gone-bad wine to it as well . this happoshu is really not any different from the other poor happoshus and is perhaps just one of them with brown food coloring . everytime i 've drunk this beer , it 's made my stomach turn . one is always enough . they got a new can though , which is awesome . the one before was awesome as well , but now they 've changed the white lettering to a gold lettering against a brown , budget-looking can ."

S'it appears dark amber with a small white head . it smells like a mix of multiple citrus flavors : i get a nice lemon , orange , grapefruit smell . there is also a nice herbal grassy hop flavor . there is a nice caramel toffee smell that balances out the citrus herbal hop smell . it tastes initially very citrusy mostly grapefruit and orange this is complemented by a nice caramel toffee flavor . a nice grassy herbal almost minty hoppy taste is also present . i get a bit of also get a bit of a spicy hop presence as well . though there is a heavy malt presence the hops are the real star of the ale . the ale ends with a nice strong potent hoppy bitterness . a bit of a bitter citrus flavor lingers on the palate for a while . the carbonation is moderate . the carbonation is about perfect for the style it adds a nice creamy texture to the ale . the drinkability is quite nice for the style . it is a thick heavy ale but it goes down quite easy . though all i can drink is one 22 ounce bottle . overall a great beer that is a seasonal to look forward to .'

S"appearance : deep copper color with a very thin head . lacing was superb smell : hops hops hops - piny , resiny and and citrusy taste : bone crushing bitter from start to finish . malty sweetness was smacked down by the bitterness . i just found the bitterness to much mouth-feel : thick and syrupy - what i 've come to expect from a double ipa drink-ability : over the top bitterness from start to finish made this a difficult beer for me to finish . i 'm glad i had it with a meal . i would not have liked this one by itself . i i much prefer the goose island imperial ipa and dog fish 90 minute ipa to this one ."

S"i 'll just cut to the chase here and state that i was very disappointed in this one . sierra nevada typically puts out great stuff , but this one is way off the mark . appearance- typical yellow pilsner look with an average head . not much to speak of with regards to retention and lacing . overall just very average to me . smell- not much going on here , but more character than ... the average beer in this style ? maybe ? i expected more from sn . smells kind of like cornbread to me which is not to suggest that i think there 's corn in it- just that it has that smell . i like cornbread but- well , meh . taste- surprisingly , dare i use the term ? `` macro-like . '' yep , i did it , but it 's true . taste is pretty minimal and perhaps not that bad if ice cold . but as it warms into the 50 's off-flavors start poking their nasty little metallic pitchforks into your tongue until finally subdued by the grainy and slightly lingering finish . there is a respectable hop bite that is worth mentioning , and the balance is actually pretty good . but this simply is n't that refreshing or tastey for that matter either . mouthfeel- is pretty much on target for the style with ample carbonation and a light body . metallic flavors in the middle muddle it up however . drinkability/final thoughts- this has got to be the most disappointed i 've been with a beer in a while . i guess i just took it for granted that all sierra nevada products were worth the price and a good representation of the style as well . honestly , i would n't have minded the lack of flavor and character so much if it were n't for the off flavors . i 'm sorry for such a negative review sn , but after paying $ 9.75 retail for a sixer of this , i must say i would have rather spent a couple more bucks and got a 30 rack of pbr . at least that i can say i actually enjoy every once in a while on a hot day ."

S"pours with plenty of carbonation yet hardly any head . like soda . color is clear and nearly like water . dirty water . nose is all banana cream pie . has some malt complexity in the flavor and the yeast adds a separate fruity element aside from the banana , but this is banana-dominated . tastes exactly like a banana runt ( the candy ) but in liquid form . or , as if someone added banana runts to ginger ale . interesting , and i think i 'll be able to finish the bottle , but this is not my thing . not only too syrupy sweet , but it does so in a fashion that the drinker can barely discern anything else going on here . there 's certainly better dessert , sweet , girly , whatever you want to call them beers available . this is probably one to pass on ."

S"750ml bottle poured into a duvel tulip . found this on a shelf next to 2008 bourbon county stout , so no idea of the age . the pour is a deep , opaque amber brown with a caramel-tinted two-finger head . this beer looks awesome . the nose is surprisingly subdued , with grapes , oak , alcohol , and a bit of acidity coming through . the aromas strengthen somewhat as the beer warms , but even then there is n't a lot to smell for a brew like this . for a beer made with grape juice , it really is difficult to pick out much acid or grape character . the oak is prominent and pleasant . i had to double check the bottle for the abv - there 's no way i would have guessed at the 12 % abv just from drinking it . very little hop character , and while the malt is n't overbearing it does start to get a bit cloying after a while . mouthfeel is creamy and very full-bodied , almost to the point where i wish there was more carbonation . a good beer , but overall i wish there was either more acid or more hops to balance things out . a few minor changes might yield a great brew ; as it stands something worth trying once and probably not again ."

S"it is a good gueuze , if a little tame . that said , i think it walks a nice line . it has a nice acidic punch and a nice dose of funkiness . it does n't sacrifice on either . plus the 'funkiness ' , while pronounced , is less drastic than other lambics . i get a lot of cherry , pineapple , and rotten orange from this one , with a touch of red wine vinegar . it emphasizes the fruit end of what brett can produce as opposed to the barnyard end . the acidity also does n't hold back , but it is also nicely present . so you get what you want without getting too much of it , if you will . it is a very good gueuze , very balanced , very nice . but frankly , i wish it were a bit more . i like gueuzes because i like the raw horse-saddle flavor , i want to be in the stables when i drink a gueuze . i 'm more chillin ' in the fruit basket with this one . if i wanted to introduce someone to gueuze , this would be a fantastic call . everything that should be there is , just milder . depending on what they liked , we could emphasize those things with other lambics . it is certainly very good , and the balance leads to a sublime drinkability , but i love the cantillon . if i am springing for a world-class lambic , that is the direction i 'd recommend ."

S"appropriately dark , and relatively viscous beer that clings to the side of the glass , with heavy lacing . the smell is malty , with noticeable alcohol and more hops than seem to be present in a sip . i was shocked by how sweet this brew is . there are a lot of flavors in this mix -- fruits , caramel , chocolate -- and these flavors pack a complex punch in the smell and taste , as does the alcohol , which causes sensation up the nose . overall , it was too sweet for me , like figs buried in sugar . i suspect i would have enjoyed the malt flavor greatly if the sweetness and alcohol were taken down a notch . i do n't consider this highly drinkable : 500 ml was far too much for me to finish ."

S"meh . not a bad beer , but in many ways it is kinda awkward . sprecher is definately more of a lager brewery and is very much in the german tradition . . . so their take on a pub ale is very germanic . i mean , it kinda tastes like they used a pilsner malt base with a little bit of brown malt for colour and taste . the earthy , chocolately notes in this beer are very subdued , no real juiciness from the hops and very clean in terms of yeast presence . so , basically , i personally like it more than a great many english brows i encounter , since i tend to like more german-tasting beers . . . but to style it is not . and even for a variation of the style , not really worth it . when i compare this to their amber ( let alone their black bavarian ) i 've got ta ask why anyone would waste their time with it . not a bad brew , but sprecher can and does brew better beers . and if browns are your thing , this probably wo n't be ."

S"i found a bottle of the 2003 release at a shop in boston . as the aging has no doubt affected the brew ( this review being written in 2009 ) , this review should be taken with a grain of salt . on the nose , then , this smells of incredibly dark , sugary malts and fruit esters -- imagine the richest loaf of banana bread you can , mixed with port aromas . in the mouth , there 's an immediate explosion of dark sugars , the extra-rich banana bread/dark fruit esters aroma translating almost exactly into flavor . another comparison might be caramelized turbinado sugar and blackstrap molasses . deep caramels , toffees , and aged port flavors are also present , overlaying a layer of burnt chocolate malt that starts off far more subtle than would be expected , but grows quickly and becomes the dominant flavor in the aftertaste . my bottle was sadly bereft of carbonation -- whether due to storage or manufacturing , i do n't know -- leaving me with a liquid so viscous and thick that i almost had sensation of a beer-flavored mouthful of light olive oil . despite these wonderful flavors , i was disappointed with the beer in the end . some have said that the american release has a distinct soy sauce flavor . while i did n't find this to be true with mine , i did feel at times as if i were drinking maple syrup that had slightly fermented , leaving a nasty sugary/yeasty combo on my tongue . like many of the reviewers below , i wonder whether the corked bottle somehow negatively affected the outcome . i would gladly try this brew if it were fresh , or came with a ( metal ) crown cap , as i think this stout *could* be great . but in its current condition -- that is , until i can find a better bottle to review -- i ca n't recommend this one ."

S'one of the brews from weefishheads . i pour this into a chalice i picked up at a recent belgian ale fest . the brew poursvery clear , fruit punch red , with a thin pink head around the rim of my chalice . not a lot of head sticking around . the smell is cherries which are obvious during the pour . smells similar to a cough drop cherry . as it warms this gets a little more sour smelling . the aroma actually also has faint similarities to a blush wine . extremely mild carbonation present . the body is medium and again reminds me of drinking a mild blush wine . there is tart cherries up front and a tangy flavor slides down the sides of my tongue . this is very nice ! actually some yeasty twang comes out as i savor this brew . the finish leaves hints of sourness in my mouth . as the beer warms a little the cherry flavor is covered by a bready yeast flavor a little . this beer is really drinkable and i am glad i didnt drink it fast since the complexity improved as the beer warmed . i recommend this to others who like to taste some different brews . thanks for a super surprise weefisheads ! !'

S"12 oz bottle into a pint a - extremely clear , golden color . light white head formation , turns into a film . well retained . bubbling is at a minimum . looks like a pils . s - speaking of pils , i detect the grainy essence of pilsner malt . light malt sweetness with that almost `` funk '' of pilsner . no hops detected here . t - starts off with a light malt note , which quickly turns to a pilsner malt dominated nose . almost skunky at times . mid-stream does show some bitterness , but hops are nowhere to be found . this beer intends to be non-offensive , and succeeds . finishes with a pilsner malt hit . aftertaste is non-existent . m - light , thin beer body . some carbonation bite , edge . little to no retained sensation on the palette . d - very drinkable . smooth , moderate and manageable abv . i would think if i was in a pils mood this beer would certainly suffice . nothing at all wrong with this beer , besides i 'm sure in many folks opinion , the label . that and the stupidly skunk inducing green bottle that is ."

S"poured from a 750ml champagne bottle into a tulip chalice . bottle marked as 2002 vintage . clear signs of aging on it 's side , good hard yeast residue on one side . virtually flat - appears as if i got a bottle that was n't properly sugared ? the last glass had a hint of head around the edge of the glass , but this one never tasted at all carbonated . this was possibly the primary reason i did n't rate higher on many accounts . color is a beautiful dark reddish-brown , properly opaque with suspended yeast as you 'd expect from a craftbrewed belgian . smell is of rich red apple , sweet yeast , white wine grapes , mild honey when warm . taste switches to green apples thanks to a light but fruity hopping . middle is of metallic minerals followed by slight caramel , warm leather , and a powdery finish . alcohol is clearly there , but in lesser quantity than the label claims . the flatness of this bottle took away from drinkability , exacerbated by the very dry character of the brew in general . the best thing about this brew is that it 's so belgian in character - it smells like my favourite belgian pub in every way ."

S"12 oz bottle poured into a tulip . pours a lightly reddish amber color with a couple fingers of off-white head . aroma is , well , 'slammed ' with hops . mainly aromatic , with a slight spice to the aroma , this brew contains little else than that . a note of fruity yeast accompanies the hops , with a bit of grassy hops as well . taste is more of the same . up front , there is little else besides a light fruit from the yeast , and at the back is a veritable hopslam ( pardon the pun ) . despite the large hop character , the hops do not overwhelm the brew , but provide a solid and strong base for the palate to work from . mouthfeel is medium bodied , with a silky texture and a dry , bitter finish . drinkability is decent . the amount of hops here lower the drinkability , but the smooth profile allow a few of these to make their way to the stomach without any problems . cheers !"

S"had on tap at bruno 's in indiana , pa . pours a clear amber with little to no head . smells very balanced with nothing but malts and hops . taste quite bready and malty at first , with the hops shining through at the end . on tap it tastes much hoppier than out of the bottle . the carbonation is great . got a little bored with the brew near the bottom of the glass . overall this is a nice pilsner , a little above average , but nothing complex or special ."

S"sam summer has lost alot of appeal to me the past few years thanks to bolder statements made by other summer micros . it 's certainly not a bad beer , but nothing great . pours a slightly cloudy golden colour with a surprisingly strong head . smells of citrus with a lemony taste to it . the problem here is that this brew is n't anything daring . at times it even tastes a bit watered down . thanks to its widespread availability , it is usually a summer staple , but it 's nothing grand overall ."

S"i like my wee heavies to have a bit of subtlety to them . i do n't want to be mugged by the alcohol or gassed by the boozy nose . this beer has all the subtlety of `` natural born killers '' . when i poured it out , i thought i was smelling the red wine my friend had been drinking earlier . then i stuck my nose in the goblet . whoops . appearance : easily the best part of the beer . a deep , dark brown with a lovely tan head . smell : umm , so i understand there 's a bit of alcohol in this thing because it smells like i could douse a shirt-wrapped stick in it , light it on fire and explore underground seattle with that sumbitch lighting the way . taste : the alcohol really overwhelms everything else in this beer . i do n't know what the malts taste like , or if there is any peat or anything else , because all i taste is hooch . mouthfeel : hey , with a beer this high in gravity , it should be nice . it is . very velvety and smooth . drinkability : to be truthful , this was undrinkable for me . too much alcohol and very little else going on . i 've had this beer for over six months , properly stored in my cellar . thank god i did n't open it when i got it , or it might have killed me . i 've got a few more alesmiths in the cellar , i hope they are a bit more complex than this one ."

S"pours a murky brown color , topped with an impressive creamy tan head , which lasts nearly to the bottom of the glass and leaves excellent lacing . the aroma is quite good , floral and herbal hops mixed with a heavy caramel , with more citrusy hops behind . suggestion of fruitiness . ok , so this is listed as an esb . it says esb on the label . on their website it is called an extra special brown , and almost all their awards are for the american brown ale category . so ... i 'm not really sure what it is . it has some of the biscuity nature and plenty of caramel like i might expect in an english version , but has very high bitterness , which is quite sharp and i wonder what their water treatment involves . and i 'm not getting anything really toasty or chocolate or otherwise dark and it 's quite sticky sweet under that substantial bitterness . i find myself wanting to call this beer an english barleywine . *shrug* it 's not clear despite the careful pour , and relatively strong and quite sticky . anyway , it 's tasty , but a little rough around the edges . the bitterness does n't fit that well with my perception of esb , the flavor does n't fit that well with brown ale . finally , it is too highly carbonated . these add up to a beer that is n't particularly drinkable , though i 'd be happy to sip one again as it definitely deserves further contemplation . my current preference would be for less caramel malt flavor , little lower gravity , less stickiness , lower carb , and if any was used , perhaps less sulfate or whatever is accentuating the hop bitterness - perhaps it is just the hop variety . the current version reminds me of a homebrew we made called `` wtf '' where we combined many many different things and made a unique , flavorful , but not particularly drinkable , beer ."

S"xiv anniversary barleywine , bottled 1/14/08 , 10.4 % abv pretty pour , with ample tight and creamy light tan head over a mostly-opaque mahogany body . head fades to a thin lid , leaving lots of thick lacing . smell is quite vinous and boozy . rum-soaked raisins , dark cherries , very fruity , warm and sweet . like cherry pie , almost . smells really good . hope it tastes this good . big ooops on the taste . overtly pine-metallic hops bitter , from start to finish , and at all temperatures . you sure this is a barleywine ? tastes like a dipa and then some . very long bitter finish . certainly the bitterest b-w i 've had . very one-dimensional . hop-heads should love this . i definitely do n't . mouthfeel is nice and round , but this is too bitter for me to keep in my mouth for long . drinkability is way down for a b-w , because this seems so out of style . weird beer : smells like a barleywine , tastes like a dipa . that takes some doing . however , i still have four of these out of a six pack for which i paid 10 bucks , and i 'm trying to figure out what to do with them . i 'm too cheap to throw them out , so maybe i 'll have them one at a time with four different very strongly flavored meals ."

S"this review is for the fresh ( er ) bottle . i stuck in notes for one year of aging . a - an amber to auburn brew with a small tan head that lingers for about two minutes and leaves no lacing . some light carbonation is visible ( although pretty intense for a barleywine ) . s - smells predominantly of a light-bodied malt , pine hops and faint caramel . abv is faintly noticable if you are looking for it , ca n't really punish them for that since it is 11 % though . t - some light pine and citrus ( grapefruit ) hops and not much else in the foretaste . maybe a bit of alcohol . the aftertaste has a lingering hop bitterness , it is potent too . a subtle alcohol is there as well . there is a light sweetness , but those who think that barleywines are generally too sweet , might enjoy this . aside from the bitterness the flavor is fairly mild . after a year of aging , saaz hops really jumped out in the flavor and taste . a lot of the pine an grape fruit had subsided . m - harsh from carbonation for the first second , then thick and pretty refreshing . d - for a barleywine , this category is very impressive . it is mild enough ( not outlandishly sweet ) that it has potential for food beyond as a dessert beer . session ? no sense in even asking that above 10 % ( or 7 % for that matter ) . i will let the others stew for a while , but i really do n't think this would alter too much with aging . the people who would enjoy this most though ( i think ) , are not the barleywine fans , but those who generally find barleywines to be too sweet . at first , i was not very impressed with this beer . but as i drank more of it , i found the potent aftertaste to be quite pleasant . one year of aging did n't really help this beer . i preferred it fresh ."

S"creamy , persistent , uniformily thick tan head tops a clear ruby hued brew . frazzled lace remains . pungently herbal and citrusy hop nose and assertive caramel malt combine with notes of leafy tobacco , mild carob , and hints of red licorice in aroma . pronounced dark caramel malt sweetness upfront in flavor is ceded and offset by toasted malt and moderate hop bitterness . fruitiness is mild , and indirectly perceptible by a concentrated , date like sweetness that emerges mid palate . moderate hop bitterness surfaces late , and although it offsets residual sugars and prevents cloying sweetness , bitterness leaves the pervasive caramel malt character unhindered . mild citrus and herb columbus hop flavor . medium bodied and slick in mouthfeel . finishes w/ an impression of caramel syrup on darkly toasted bread . old blarney is a tasty and unique barleywine . other than the dominant caramel malt profile , there was n't great depth of character , however . it 's more of a dessert barleywine than an everyday sipper ."

S"thanks grant for the treat . pored this one into a large snifter sitting by a camp fire . i must say it may have influenced my score some by adding to the experience i even lit up a liga privada no.9 for my second glass which paired prefect in my book . the brew had a tan colored head on top of a dark brown body , and the head lasted leaving great lacing on the side of the glass . big roasted malt aromas ' come from this brew , so you get some coffee espresso notes . now it might have been the campfire but i did get a slight hint of smoke lol . it had a medium to light body . i wished for a tad more probably my only knock on the brew . the flavor was great , it had a healthy amount of sweet caramel malts to me with the right amount of roasted bitters to keep this brew well balanced . again i did get some smokiness to it as well , but like i said the atmosphere enhanced this one . a great scotch ale well worth the effort to obtain . the drinkability was off the charts for me . i would love another bottle ( hint )"

S"at 250 ml and 12 % alc , this is a liquid uppercut ! poured a murky bronze with a short , even head that dissipated after the second sip . smell was mildly fragrant , like mild orange blossoms and allspice . taste was a tapestry of orange zest , nutmeg , garlic , cloves and pommegranite . and alcohol . the smell is not indicative of the stong zap of alcohol . it 's even misleading . aftertaste is what i imagine it is like to gargle with aqua net . mouthfeel not unlike a macro . lots of bubbles seperate the liquid from the palette . average . sip this one slowly . i began the review stone sober and by the fifth sip i felt unfit to operate heavy machinery . definately not an everyday beer , but worth it if you can pick one up ."

S"a big abbey fan , i have been eyeballing leffe for a while . i have been told its not a great beer , so i have put it off in favor of what i really like drinking when it comes to selection time . i finally i bought a 6 pack for 8.99 at my local fine foods store , and went straight home to pour a tall glass . it looks like a beautiful beer , very bright and golden , with carbonation bubbles finding their way surfaceward to take their place among a nice bubbly head that lingers a bit and lightly hugs the glass . smells nice , a bit fruity , with a refreshing effervescent quality . does smell a bit on the citrus side . the taste was a bit disappointing from the get-go . i think i expected more , but it really tasted more like a fruity lager than anything else , with notes of banana bread . the cloves while present do n't really add to the beer ... the alcohol flavor is there , but more pronounced on the finish , which i would have to describe as bitterly bland . not a whole lot going on here . as for the mouthfeel , quite thin , which was expected . i could probably polish off 5 or 6 of these , but would n't enjoy it as much as a should ( except for the abv , a clean 6.6 ) . for an abbey blonde , i guess it fits the bill , but barely . i would n't recommend it however . in general a letdown ."

S'this beer is a thick black with caramel highlights , and presents a creamy , rocky head which is on the small side and reduces somewhat quickly , but adheres well to the glass . some sediment is visible along the edge of the glass . the smell is strong , rich and malty , reminiscent of bread and licorice . there is some chocolate , a subtle sweetness , and the alcohol is definitely noticeable . the flavor is initially understated , light . a creamy , full body presents itself , rolls around luxuriously on the tongue . it is sweet and warming , malty , with a roasted character . the finish is as powerful as the aroma , with chocolate , caramel , and a healthy bitterness . wow , what an aroma ! i love the way this beer starts off strong , with the rich smell , and then lays back for the creamy , gorgeous feel , then comes back strong in the finish . the bitterness is minimal at first , but grows strong in the finish . the smell gives away the alcohol , but the flavor hides it . the flavor starts off light and creamy , but a chocolate character reveals itself in the end . a beer of contrasts . a roller-coaster ride . when the strong of will give in , and the last bottle of this beer is drunk , i hope that someone finds it in their heart to brew it again .'

S'pours a dark caramel color with a thin head . nose is light and dry , some sugary malt and a trace of berries . flavors are rich and malty sweet , pungent , almost syrupy . dark caramel , some butterscotch , maybe some faint peat . i detect a little bit of sweet fruity esters , which i think is uncharacteristic for the style and detracts a bit . some residual alcohol heat and slickness in the finish , along with some mild woody , whiskey element . mouthfeel is medium-heavy , slick and slightly sticky on the lips . aging since they opened ( 4 months ) , this beer might benefit from another 4-6 months to smooth it out and better meld the flavors together . my first impression of this beer was not favorable . i still think this beer is too estery to be true to the wee heavy style , but the flavors have come together a little more than when it was first released , so i bumped my score up slightly . served in a smaller glass and for a higher price than the rest ( because of the higher abv , limit of 2 , blah blah blah ) .'

S'picked up my first 6 pk of this on a beer haul this weekend . the pour on this brew was very nice . it poured very much like it says on the bottle , with a deep mahogany brown . it had a nice , small white head , that faded pretty fast . the aroma on this brew can only be explained as complex . the first aroma that his the nose is some very strong dark malts . that is followed by a some what yeasty , banana aroma . its soon followed with a bunch of other aromas such as cherries , sweet raisins , it also has a nice nose of what smells like brandy . the flavors on this brew are very good as well . the first flavors you pick up on are the raisins and toffee . these flavors lead into the dark malts and then into some of the other sweet fruity flavors that make up the brew . there is a nice sugary sweet flavor that comes from the beet sugars that balance all the flavors of this brew . the mouthful on this brew is well balanced and smooth . it has light to medium body , with a wonderfully dry finish . the alcohol burn afterwords is great , a nice warming feeling . the drink on this is pretty decent . for some drinkers it might become heavy , as well well as the alcohol burn might turn a few away . i am a huge fan of dfh beers , and once again , they have not let me down . this was my first time on this brew and i will of course at it to my regulars . thanks dfh .'

S"having read about this somewhere or other , i was pretty interested going in . pours the colour of weak black tea . a finger or so of head which dissipates almost immediately . smells herbal , slightly sweet and slightly medicinal . not a lot going on . i really had to get my nose in there . sweet and malty , a little honey and a floral taste from the heather . vaguely smoky finish . nothing too crazy , but it 's different . unusual and quite pleasant aftertaste . watery and fairly flat . a more robust body and it might be an entirely different experience . it 's dead easy to drink though , and very refreshing . i only bought one , and while i did n't love it , i could see myself drinking more . i do n't know that i 'll buy it again , though . i imagine you could have done a lot worse 4000 years ago : )"

S"dark tan head that is both creamy and lacy , sticks to the side of your glass as you drink it . massive roasted smell compared to other stouts , with a hint of astringency . big roasted barley assault upfront on the palate with a strong hop bitterness and no hop aroma , slight aftertaste of licorice and bitter chocolate . thick mouthfeel that also seems to `` fizz '' on your tounge slightly . this is a big , bold , black and beautiful stout , and why i love the style ... very heavy , which is what i drink a stout for ..."

S"rogue , of course , gives the best example of how to do a chili pepper beer right , if you have the balls to do it at all ! first of all , it has to be an ale , something with sufficient flavor in itself to support the extra spicy chili taste , not one of those weak lagers with a pepper in the bottle ( crazy ed , i 'm talking to you ! ) , and they use smoked chipotles , for an extra twist ! got ta love you , rogue , and i rue the day i do n't ! appearance : a dull orangish color , topped with a huge , frothy white head . aroma : clean , but slightly spicy , with tiny hints of fruit , mellow , but still intriquing . taste is mellow at first , but before long the flavors unfurl , and then it hits ... and kicks ... subtly at first , then flowering , and revealing a definite peppery character that soon dominates the palate with slow-arriving , but quickly conquering heat ! still tasty and fruity , as any decent ale should be , with that peppery tinge at the back of the palate and lingering in the base of the throat . smokey peppery character really adds a unique dimension to this brew , and it deserves extra points for boldness and uniqueness alone ! yummy , delicious , and hot , hothot ! ! ! now it 's taking over my heade and creeping around other parts of the body , and it just gets hotter as we drink along ... my damned head is flame , as the 22 0z . bottle is nearly emptied ! hot , hot , hot and getting hotter , man , it 's time to call the bucket brigade ! big old thanks to bierriese for helping me to reunite this once-tasted ale to my lips once more !"

S"this stuff is the blackest of black . by far the darkest stout i have ever seen . the head of this beer is brown . not tan , not off white , ... brown ! the smell is all chocolate and alcohol . very faint bitter hops are noticeable . taste is a strong chocolate punch in the teeth . after that first swig i notice some nutty flavors and raisin like fruit encased in bitter hops . bitter chocolate finish in the back of the palate while sweet flavors continue to dance around in the front . aftertaste coats the mouth and very much resembles the smell of the beer . mouthfeel is fantastic . this is a true meal in a glass . pitch black , very chocolatey , and thick as hell . drinkability suffers do to the weight and power of this beer . if you 're drinking this , then you are have a beer . a sixer of this should last you at least 6 days ."

S"750ml bottle poured into my darkness glass ... not quite a gusher but a big pop with a slow crawl . huge carbonation as i 'm only able to pour about three ounces of beer and i get about nine fingers of head . the head is nice , pretty and fluffy tope ; sick lacing . the beer is a nice honey gold . a little less head would have been nice , but not sure how this could look any better ... the aroma is a bit much for me as its dominated by pepper , of the black variety , not sure i or anyone could tell the difference of a green peppercorn , but it sounds cooler , right ? trying desperately to pull anything else out but the pepper and i ca n't ! not the note that should be dominating your beer . i actually like the pepper of it , just too much , needs to be 1/10th of that level ... the taste tones down the pepper on the front and gives off some nice floral and honey notes that i quite enjoy . however 2/3 's of the way through the pepper makes a come back , especially on the swallow . still too much for me , but an interesting twist . as i drink it more and it warms slightly better . again not bad just too much pepper . top five pepper beer i 've had , but needs more restraint before its entirely drinkable ."

S"appearance- this beer is a light shade of raspberry red in color with a white head . very unique appearance ! smell- rating is subjective to what you like in a beer . smells like berries with a little bit of hops , which i found to be a very pleasant smell . could have a stronger aroma , though . taste- this is a very subjective category in terms of a rating , as well . the taste of raspberries dominates this brew . you can also taste bitter hops , but it 's masked quite a bit by the berry flavor . if you like berries and fruit-flavored beer , this is a winner . if not , then you will not care for the taste much at all . mouthfeel- there 's a fair amount of carbonation , which i enjoy , and it 's pretty thin . has the mouthfeel of a typical american light lager . drinkability- this a beer that goes down easy in limited quantities , but after having a couple , the sweetness becomes a bit much , so it 's not easy to drink this stuff in large quantities . overall- this is one of favorite beers to sit down to after a long day . the prevalent berry flavor makes this enjoyable for me , but i would n't want to drink more than a couple of these at a time ."

S"where can you go in 90 minutes ? when you can in 90 minutes or faster , i would suggest to pick up dogfish heads 90 minute ipa . this is one of the best beer i can say that i have ever had . 90 minutes is so named for the hop timing . every minute within the hour and a half boiling , hops are added to the wort . how do i know , take a whiff of the beer ! the speed of light is considered to equal nearly 300,000,000 meters per second . so how fast is that in 90 minutes ? well roughly over 1,000,000,000 miles . well you do n't have to look that far to see 90 minutes ipa . the cloudy and hazel amber brown color has a decent head and limited lace . you would think it would be green . the smell is nothing but hops . not that that is a bad thing . the sr 71 blackbird , considered one of the fastest airplanes in the world , will take you up to 3300 miles in 90 minutes . one sip of 90 minutes will take you heaven . this double ipa is complex . i very nice mix of malt and hops . the citrus flavor is sweet and mixes nicely with the slight grapefruit tingle of the hops . the end aftertaste is sort of piney but not bad . the alcohol you would expect is not very present or at least until you are done . the fast train in the world is the three-car maglev train ( which is a magnetic levitation train ) that travels from shanghai to the international airport pudong near tokyo and can travel up to 581 km/hour ( 361 mph ) . or sticking to our theme , can travel 541 miles in 90 minutes . this all with a full load of passengers . dogfish head is not something that is accessible , but i could ride a train to get it . at least i was able to try it once , lucky me . one thing about dogfish is that is not something you would not be able to drink a 6 pack of . the taste is expectation and would rank as a beer that is not to miss ."

S"la trappe - a beer that only recently arrived in my part of the world , but based on the label and number of places it appeared in at once , it must be a fairly commercial brewery by trappist standards . best before end 02-2009 . appearance : pours a beautiful warm amber-copper colour , reasonably clear with a delicate beige head . this gets such a high score for appearance because it was both what i expect from a good tripel as well as exceeding my expectations for this beer . and it was just what i wanted , too ! smell : there 's something funky about this - i hope it 's not my glass , i just washed that . i noticed something strange about the bottle smell too . i hope it was just something crusty on the lip of the bottle or something , i.e . it wo n't affect the other three of the four-pack ! as i swirl it around i get the tripel aromas i was looking for . candied sugar , honey , rich malt , maybe even pear . still , this bottle smells funny so it ca n't score too highly . taste : not affected too adversely by the smells . at the same time , not as complex as i would have liked . a nice honeycomb/candied sugar effect on the palate , working its way into the nostrils even ! the ester must have a pretty long hydrocarbon tail . wa-hay . pungent sour apple flavours on the tip of the tongue and strangely , around my gums . maybe that 's the carbonation or something , but it works . overall i 'm pretty impressed , but that lingering solvent-like aroma is spoiling things just a bit . ( by the way , there 's no soap or anything in my glass . i rinsed it a billion times with hot water . it 's something about the bottle - hopefully it 'll improve by the next one - if so , i 'll edit and update at the end of the review ) . mouthfeel : a little watery - would have liked it a bit more viscous and honey-like to add to the tripel mystique . drinkability : very easy to drink . i only just looked at the 8 % abv now , i knew it would be kinda strong , but the 8 % is very deceptive . it 's a friendly beer , makes you want to knock it back and grab another one . this would be a fun few beers to bring to a party to get that baby started . in short , it goes down great . overall : pretty complex , pity about this one bottle - i 'm sure it ca n't have that weird smell to every bottle . i like it - definitely not the best ( not many tripels"

S'brrr it is cold in here , as is my review . i remember the first time i was drunk . it was icehouse that did the trick . i am not bashing this beer for that or any reason other than it being a poor crafted beer again by the miller company . it poured out clear almost fantaish orange . not much of a head to mention . smell was amost of a seltzer , just as carbonated . taste was ummmm ... yeah . mouthfeel was highly bubbly not my choice . very hippty hoppity . i do not need any more of this beer please mr. take this away , no more oh no .'

S'appearance 750 ml green bottle with gold shrink wrap from julios . it pours with a 3 finger creamy white head that lasts for the duration . the beer is a haze free amber-orange with rapid streams of bubbles . surprised to see a so-called farmhouse ale be so clear . smell light malty aroma with just a hint of yeast funk . bready , with some vanilla , dull compared to what i expected . taste almost lagerish , definitely leans more towards bire de garde than saison . very clean flavor , toasted malts with a hint of nobel hops and a little alcohol . it is towards the sweet side of the spectrum , but still pretty well balanced . its a fine flavor , just a bit on the boring side , particularly compared to the other tasty offerings from thiriez that i have had the pleasure of sampling . with the yeast swirled in for the last glass , the beer gets a slightly spicier flavor that i enjoy considerably more than the beer straight , this also gives the beer a more appealing hazy appearance . mouthfeel this had a medium-full mouthfeel with sharp carbonation at first that quickly bubbles itself flat . drinkability & notes one of the more drinkable farmhouse style ales out there , mainly because of its subtle flavor and alcohol on the low side . amber is a good intro to french/belgian farmhouse ales for those afraid of funk and unidentifiable flavors , which are sadly two of my favorite things .'

S"i ( wiseman nick ) split this with wisewoman liz yesterday afternoon . the following review was written using notes . served in a 20oz . nonic glass . appearance : pitch black body with ashy-brown head on top . though completely opaque , the body looked a little thin - similar to an irish dry stout . the head was small and bubbly , but showed great retention and drug stingy lace . smell : lots of roastiness here : roasted malt , black coffee , charred wood , etc . bold , acidic , and harsh-natured ; this one burned the nostrils a bit . me likey . taste : the smell multiplied . dark chocolate flakes join the party this time around . burnt malts and black coffee abound . finishes is like an iced french roast . simple , yet totally delicious . mouthfeel : kinda thin , very dry , and mellowly carbonated . medium bodied , but robustly flavored . cole porter really gives the taste-buds a workout . drinkabilty : while i loved the taste of this beer , i do n't know if i 'd want a whole twenty ounces . the taste felt a little overpowering , and the feel bordered on harsh and acidic . i was very happy to split this , but i would n't order another ."

S"appearance - light straw color . thick fluffy head that disappears very quickly , no lacing at all . smell - there is almost no smell , but what there is is mostly a corn smell with a slight hint of hops if you look for it . taste - really not bad , its not good , but its not bad . nothing offensive really about the taste , pretty clean and smooth . mouthfeel - not over carbonated , pretty much the same as taste , not bad , not good . drinkability - i think i could drink a case of this stuff and still walk strait . you do n't get tired of drinking it or full . perfect beer for tailgating , parties , or beer pong . not something you drink to enjoy , deffinitely a party beer . for what it is , a macro american light beer that is extremely cheap , its actually really good . out of the three commonly dirt cheap light beers ( keystone , natty , and busch ) , i would have to say this is by far the best ."

S"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a new belgium globe . half finger of toffee colored thin head with very little retention . aroma is on the light side but consists of milk chocolate , some oatmeal of course and a hint of brown sugar . at first taste my impression is that the beer is too thin , but then i remember to concentrate on the taste . it 's much drier than i would have thought . the beer is described to be very malty , but i 'm not getting the same impression as it does n't balance well with the bitterness really . roasted chocolate on the palate with a touch of bread . mouthfeel is too thin , but even with the lack of carbonation and balance the beer is one i might pick up once in a while if i 'm in the mood for a porter and the choices are n't remarkable ."

S'a nice find on tap at mellow mushroom , this quad pours a nice mahogany color with garnet highlights . an off-white head puffs up for a minute , then quickly settles to a ring . no lace . aroma is dark malts , fig , plum , dark cherry , and pepper . there are hints of clove-like sweetness with a not-so-subtle rush of alcoholic heat . smells better than the bottled version , but more alcoholic . flavor is rich and malty , highlighting dark fruits , melon , tobacco , and light peppery spice . it has a trademark avery hoppy finish that actually helps balance out the alcoholic heat . or at least masks it . body is below medium , definately not up to the standards of a good quad . mouthfeel is slick and wet , with softy fizzy carbonation . needs time to mellow out . still , a decent interpretation of the style .'

S"cask . so this is what those british guys were talking about with subtle , balanced cask beers ? i like it ! need to get to england . pours a thick , leggy dark brown - less black than black tuesday it seems - with pretty much no head . slight reddish hues even . insane aroma - really really complex and crazy . huge chocolate-covered cherries , along with sweet caramel , bourbon , -bals , and molasses . the flavor is just insane . gigantic bourbon-soaked chocolate cherries of the awesomest kind . a little boozy , but in a good way . a little sweet , but in the best way . -bals are not absent either . this is better than black tuesday or chocolate rain , as crazy as that sounds . smooth and slick on the mouthfeel , like silk . the abv is present but well-hidden . carbonation is nearly nonexistent , like a lost abbey beer , but in a good way . overall , awesome , just awesome . drinkable for the abv and thoroughly enjoyable . tay zonday was n't kidding when he talked about how awesome chocolate rain ( and its variants ) were ."

S"we have all been there . you go to a bar with some friends that are not into beer just hoping you will be able to find something better but you just have no luck . you are left in the same delimma that many before you have face : bud , bud light , coors light , miller lite , etc ... .i normally choose to go straight for the harder stuff when faced with these choices but sometimes you have to bite the bullet , sometimes it 's even a silver one but not on this night . pour does n't start off that bad , light golden color with a fluffy white head . aroma is slightly vegetal , slightly sweet and really hard to pick up . i 'm able to pick up the vegetal feel even more in the taste along with that slight sweetness , no presence of hops . it certainly is n't the worst beer i 've ever drank but it is far from the best either ."

S"i did not care from this out of a can a couple of years ago , but it still elicits amusing memories for me from my misspent youth . i might have dared a full 40 were it not for my local also having 22 's for sale . i got a little better than a finger of fizzy bone-white head that seemed to be falling as fast as i could pour , ending with a bunch of wisps . color was a deep golden-yellow with ne-quality clarity . in fact , this kind of thing is the gold standard for clarity . nose was candy sweet , like bubble gum and even some fusel alcohol . ugh . a 22 may be more than enough for this old man . mouthfeel was medium with a sugary sweetness in the mouth . i imagine that if you took a bag of sugar and stirred it into a liquid medium until it became saturated , this would be what it would taste like . the finish was fairly dry with a burning sensation going down . man , this is evil . i was intimidated by such things as a kid , but now i am just disgusted ."

S"i was walking up and down the open cooler at dorothy lane market trying to decide what to after the original target was missing and i settled on this beer because i had n't had it before . it was also one of the few ipa 's they carry there that i had n't there , mad hatter and wolaver 's are the others . the label talks a big game and the prominently displayed hop picture kind of reminds me of victory 's hop devil offering ... if only . i 've taken to doing a straight pour into my catalina pilsener glass to get a head started and then pour on the side of the glass . the result was offwhite head that quickly diminished , leaving some average lacing as it subsided . the color was a deep copper , not quite brown , and should , upon further reflection , have signaled to me what i was about to taste . there was a smell , an aroma is too kind a word , but it was not the big floral/citrusy hop aroma i expect from top end ipa 's like ruination and a new favorite , founder 's centennial ipa . it smelled ... malty . i tasted the head and it certainly did n't taste like an american ipa , but something from a half forgotten night at brews , or a night in the dorm room , told me that i had tasted this before . english ... ipa ? maybe , but not a good effort . i had samuel smith india ale a few months ago and thought maybe it was that , only not as good . as write now though i am also reminded of fuller 's esb . either way h.i . is not labeled as an english-style anything . the name implies big hops , 7 kinds , but weyerbacher managed to underhop or over malt an ipa an give us a bitter . a note : the mouthfeel is decent not creamy , but not watery as some ipas can be , somewhere in the middle . if it was watery it would be pretty tough to force down the five remaining bottles of this stuff , but i will , and maybe if i pretend i 'm pouring it out of a different bottle ... well you get the idea ."

S"pours a reddish orange with a slightly pink head . not much lacing to speak of . the aroma is dominated by sweet strawberry . not really a fresh strawberry aroma , more like bubble yum or some gummy candy . maybe a slight hint of wheat malt , but i may just be imagining it . taste is dominated by artificial strawberry candy flavors . sugary sweet with not much depth , but some malt does poke through . almost tastes like smucker 's strawberry preserves . the mouthfeel is fairly light , but not watery . it would probably be smooth if not for all the carbonation . finish is a bit on the sticky side for such a light beer . there is some acidic dryness but not enough to balance out all the sugar . i am glad this came in a small bottle as i do not care for it , but i suppose it is fairly drinkable of you like sugary stuff . i bought it for my wife who loves framboise and even she gave it the thumbs down ."

S"ca n't believe i have n't yet reviewed the version of this minnesota original now being brewed with love by schell in new ulm ... . pours out of the clear 12 oz . twist off bottle a clear light golden colour , with an ample rocky head and lots of carbonation holding it together . heavy rings of lace , too . aroma is unlike any other lager beer i 've ever had ... flowery , like rose petals ... plenty of corniness and some sweet maltiness . it 's a very aromatic lager . the taste can best be described as incredibly sweet for the style . ample maltiness and a definite corn adjunct flavour . no doubt about the corn , but it 's tasty in a good way . as for the hop profile , i get very little bitterness to try to balance out the sweet aspect , but i suspect the some of the flowery aspects come from the use of some sort of hops . anyway , the body is definitely above medium , with a mouthfeel that is a bit slick and syrupy , but certainly silky smooth . the antithesis of the crisp and clean lager . finishes with a sweet aftertaste . drinkability is a bit of an enigma ... in the summertime it quenches like no other and i refer to it as liquid candy in a bottle . otherwise , it can get a bit cloying after a few due to the fact that this just an overly sweet and sugary lager . but it tastes damn good . for those who like to order a beer with their spicy bloody mary , i 've found that this is a perfect compliment ."

S"a little darker , and perhaps with some orangish hues that your average pils wo n't have . head retention was not particularly remarkable very hoppy aroma : flowery and fruity . citrus and apricot , as well . very fruity tasting as well . decidedly maltier than a standard pils , but still with an aggressive hop character i think the beauty of a nice pils is totally hijacked by this style . my expectation of pilsners is a clean malt that crisply sets up hops . this is just too sugary . one style that `` imperial '' or `` double '' just does n't belong in front of"

S"another hook-up from a fantastic auxiliary member of the canquest ( tm ) , einweizenbitte , who is one of the more prescient cantacts in this madness . i have no idea of his background or employment , but he is language fluent , well-traveled , tack-sharp and generous to boot . many , many thanks ! he often refers to me as `` herr konigsberg '' , which is allen konigsberg 's original surname before he inverted his first ( given ) name to his current surname and took on `` woody '' from a source unknown to me . brilliant ! how about some crack & glug ? that sounds like a water street girl 's come-on , actually . whoops . suggestions welcome . i can not convey in words how adept i have become at the inverted pour from a can . the idea is to begin with a weak flow and then totally invert the can . it results in a head that is to die for , even off of some cheap aal , plus you can totally experience the nose . i had two rocky fingers ' worth of bone-white head that fell like wile e. coyote from a cliff , leaving behind some fascinating lace . nose was , sadly , metallic , but it had nothing to do with the can itself . this was just poorly made lager . color was a pretty golden-yellow with ne-quality clarity , for you aesthetes . mouthfeel was medium with the metallic taste refusing to allow anything else to come to the forefront . oof . even the finish was like heavy metal . no f'n ' way is this going into my cooler ! soundtrack for drinking this beer : some heavy metal . think ozzy , motorhead , et al ."

S"recevied via trade from jfunkk79 thanks ! bottle dated 5/1/09 ( 6 months old ) poured into a large snifter a : a vigorous pour gives a surprisingly large head considering the abv which quickly dissipates , orangeish redish with a cream head looks like a typical barleywine s : malty sweetnes and faint hops t & m : here is where the beer goes horribly horribly wrong . way too sweet , hot , and mediciny . hops taste faint . this beer is a total mess , a perfect example of just because you can do something does n't mean you should . though this might have been aged improperly or be better fresh . d : ha ! are you kidding me it took me a few hours to finish this beer . i never really contemplated drain pouring it but i was n't exactly looking forward to each sip . it was worth trying but other than possibly giving a fresh bottle a try i wo n't be seeking this out anymore . double bastard is a similar kind of beer but actually tastes good ."

S"poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a mug . this beer borders on absolutely black , with a cappuccino coloured head . the head is about one fingers worth , but it retains extremely well . it 's a pretty good smelling beer . that is , if you can smell it ! there 's mostly roasted coffee malts , but also a bit of creaminess , and a bit of chocolate . the problem is , the smell is so faint , i had to struggle to smell it . the taste , unfortunately , is where guinness faulters more . the way it looks , you 'd expect it to have nice , strong , rich malty flavors . and , it really does n't . it hits the mouth more like a lager . water is the predominant flavor . if i focus , i can find some roasted malts in here , but there 's really nothing else going on . at least it 's nothing offensive . i 'd drink this in the dead of summer , it 's super refreshing and nothing close to the traditional views of a `` dark '' beer . however , the mouthfeel and drinkability do a bit to make up for the ( lack of ) taste . the mouthfeel is super creamy , and goes down the throat very nicely . it honestly could stand to be a bit thicker . it 's also very drinkable , i could chug this as fast as i can chug water . this is my first guinness i 've ever had , and it 's kind of confusing . all my time drinking almost exclusively dark beer have me equating dark with lots of flavor . this is n't the case , even the lightest of craft beers have more flavor than this . however , the excellent mouthfeel and drinkability do quite a bit to make up for this . an interesting beer , for sure . i 'm very interested in trying this from the nitro-can to see if my experience is different , because this is possibly the only beer i 've seen that encourages me to drink it straight from the bottle ."

S"it seems to me that i tried this many years ago and was quite indifferent about it , while thinking its not really my style . tried this again at a beer tasting last evening . the appearance is bright reddish purple with a thin lighter colored head . the smell is off putting , not because of the cherry but the quality . it 's an obviously artificially contrived scent reminiscent of ludens cough drops . the taste follows , sticky sweet cherry soda mixed with aspartame . the aftertaste of this sweetner lingers . surprisingly and perhaps disappointingly there is not much sourness here . i 'll be fair and keep appearance and drinkability at the average mark . kool aid and cheap wine coolers are big sellers . this is easy to drink with no big boozy taste . i just do n't know why anyone would opt for this ? to me craft beer is all about the best ingredients , not artificial crap !"

S"pours cloudy reddish brown . produces little head , even with a rough pour . minimal fine lacing . not much to look at . smells like chocolate toffee meeting asphalt in that ozone spot right when it starts raining . some fruits , all dark and all somewhat prune-juice like , poke through . average is a stretch . has that flavor that i ca n't quite put my finger on , but i really ca n't stand . for such a highly rated beer , i ca n't by any means figure out why . honestly it 's one step away from a drainpour . heavy super dark fruits and warm prune juice would be a complementary way to describe the flavor . feel wise it 's typically scottish ale like , thick and rich , low carbonation , not bad at all . drinks horrible . will not seek out , recommend , or buy . it 's not just the style as i rated bellhaven wee heavy quite highly . something about this beer stands out as `` i hate it .

S"rather than describe the color and smell because i 'm sure the description will be exactly the same as everyone other review , i will say that this is the beer that i always buy when i 'm short on coin . this is not the best tasting lager in the world , but it is damn good for the $ 5.79 you pay for a six pack of 16oz cans ( in boston ) . by far the best beer i 've had for that money . compared to the price of pbr , this beer is far superior . its cheaper than bud and coors and i think it tastes much better . narragansett lager is a must try for anyone who drinks beer . on a side note , i was in block island , ri last weekend ( off the coast of narragansett ) , and in the grocery store there was a sign for narragansett lager and advertised on the sign was a note saying that this beer was rated an `` a '' by the alstrom brothers . granted their actual rating is not far off from that , i found that kind of funny ."

S"i used to drink this beer with a buddy of mine . his family had loyalties to the hacker-pschorr brewery and he 'd always bring me back some . so when i saw this for sale , i made a point of buying it . my girlfriend 's response ( always a good barometer ) was , `` it is quite plain . '' i 'd have to agree . it is n't that there is anything wrong with it , it is just the absence of something right -- and in the market of german hefe-weizens , if you do n't set yourself apart , what is the point ? the ester profile is heavily dominated by banana with a hefty dose of pear added to it . the malt profile is thick and rich , almost too much so for a hefe , but they manage to make it work . the initial ester onslaught fades into a nice thick slice of bread , with a nice honey , mango , and grape finish and a long , lingering banana aftertaste . all very well done , do n't get me wrong . but it does n't really stand out . i will say the extra 0.5 % alcohol is readily noticable , giving the beer a slick mouthfeel and , well , the alcohol is noticable in the taste . that simply should not be . if i am drinking a beer under 8 % alcohol and i taste alcohol , there is something wrong imho . good , but not great . it combines the one-dimensionality of franzi with the unsessionability of ayinger ."

S"2002 vintage , sampled on december 6 , 2006 . a michael jackson selection from last year , let 's see what this obscure brew has to offer . served in a wide mouthed oversize brandy snifter at cellar temperature . appearance- pours a very predictable caramelized red , much like your typical ebw . the thin , light beige head rises to about a finger and then settles to a completely disorganized heap of confused bubbles . smell- dense , massive aromas of vanilla , bourbon , caramel , oak , malt , and hops greet the nose with an aggressive enthusiasm . as the beer opens up further , the generous amounts of hops added to the kettle become more and more prominent . taste- with a `` best by end 2006 '' freshness date , this should be drinking well right now ... but sadly , it is n't . this tastes remarkably close to an old , warm bottle of arrogant bastard that 's been sitting out open overnight ... the hops overtaking the malts so forcefully that the balance is no longer there . for an english barley wine , as the style suggests , this lacks depth and interest . mouthfeel/drinkability- the initial carbonation , quick and fleeting , does n't add anything to this increasingly difficult-to-drink beverage . by the time i swirl in the sediment , the beer is practically flat . now , any redeeming quality going on here has been replaced with a hot , sharp bite that just does n't make me want to finish this . this particular offering from the rare beer club was a disappointment ."

S"appearance : when viewed indirectly , it appears black like a cola soda . held up directly to the light , it displays a rich orange/brown color . smell : smells like pears , pineapples , grapes , toffee , and eventually a fresh brewed coffee taste . as it warms up from 4c to room temperatures ( 20c ) it ends up smelling like a tim hortons 'double double ' . taste : is very complex . i tasted it fridge cold ( 4c ) and constantly as it warmed up . the initial taste was very estery ; pineapple , banana , clove and cinnamon ( ? ) . warming up , the malt starts to show through , providing a nice biscuity , coffee chew . mouthfeel : fairly thick , chewy and velvety : the carbonation could be a little less and i would have rated it as a 5.0 drinkability : i like this beer . a lot . especially coming from other faxe variants such as strong and royal export . i honestly was not expecting a lot . had i not consumed this at 1 am , i perhaps would consider this more drinkable . overall : i had been wanting to try this beer for about 5 years . finally found it july 9/2010 , although i had overlooked it 3 days earlier . comparing it to doppelbocks such as celebrator or salvator does it a disservice ; this beer stands on it 's own . at $ 1.95 cdn , this is quite a bargain . wish it was available in winnipeg ."

S'pours a light straw-gold color with a nice thick head . great lace left on the glass after each sip . smell is very floral and very lightly malty . light to medium bodied mouthfeel with powerful ( but not overwhelming ) hops and a touch of malt . this beer screams hops in the nose , but is very balanced . finished almost bone-dry and crisp . a very drinkable beer , that i bought as a hot weather thirst quencher , but i would drink all year round . the only problem i see with this , is my inability to stop drinking it !'

S"poured into an e & j cask & cream glass on 4/24/11 burnt , rusty hues ; clear . billowy two fingers of foam . head retention is much thinner ; the foam crackles as is disappears . no lace of which to speak . the aroma is an unpleasant journey of herbs , orange rind , burnt grass , faux watermelon candy , bubblegum , plastic , toast and hints of veggies . not much caramel to be found . the aroma is such that i had to force myself to take a drink ; bad idea . one sip confirms - this is disgusting . notes of paper , watery malts , tea leaf hops , candy overtones , the faintest spot of toasty caramel and an aftertaste similar to being around too many steamed vegetables . medium body seems appropriate but carbonation is far too vigorous ; it 's mildly distracting . finishes prickly and with a coating feel . lingering residuals . yippie . the color is nice and the feel could be worse . other than that there is n't much to like about this one . i drainpoured half the bottle ."

S"appearance - deep red , 1 finger of head which reduced . smell - lots of grapefruit and kiwi fruit , though not quite up there with feral hop hog . taste - sorry , but this definitely tastes like a regular ipa , not a dipa . the hoppy flavour is quite underwhelming for a beer that supposedly has an `` outrageous '' hopping schedule . the taste is not fruity enough , and there is a little too much sweetness created by the malt ( though this would be excusable in a more fruity beer ) . still , this would appeal to more people than pretty much any other dipa . mouthfeel - too light for the style , a little bit cloying , low carbonation . drinkability - pretty drinkable . actually , this is definitely too drinkable for the style . overall - a little disappointing , considering the description on the bottle . fans of regular american pale ales should like this , but real dipa fans will find this underwhelming ."

S"now , i 'm reviewing this beer for what it is . i 'm sick of people on here judging it against crafts and microbrews etc. , because that it ai n't . this is made for one purpose and one purpose only ; to get slammed for cheap . it does that extremely well . a - a pale yellow , looks a little like golden piss . s - none to speak of really . t - there really is none after the first two or three . m - you do n't feel it at all , so as a binge beer ( i wo n't glorify this by calling it a session ) this is great . d - this is probably the most drinkable beer i 've ever had . ultimately inoffensive , not stimulating at all , and goes down like water . maybe even easier , since you 're probably more likely to be puking your guts out if you chug water than you are if you chug this . now , do n't get me wrong . this does not belong in the hall of fame , by any standards . one must keep context in mind , however , and review it for what it 's worth . as an american pale lager , a frat-boy beer , this is great . this is totally slumming for me , but ... i honestly do n't mind . you can usually find a 24 pack for $ 16.99 ( in florida ) , and that 's damn good compared to miller/coors/etc . if you 're looking to get drunk , this is the place to be . if you 're looking for a well-crafted beer , this is also the place to be ; it may not be the traditional craft beer , but it is exquisitely made for its purpose . if you 're a beer snob , stay away , this is n't for you . if you do n't drink to get drunk , again , probably stay away . you want to get slammed for cheap without choking on steel reserve , though ? this one 's for you ."

S"this is one of those timeless classics i 'll never get tired of . the appearance i find is not unlike that of most european lagers . smells pretty skunky , most certainly not the nicest smelling beers . it does however taste pretty good , and it does feel nice on the mouth . slightly bitter but not completely overbearing . it is as drinkable as other beers of this genre . overall this beer is n't really exceptional , but it 's really not that bad either . certainly worth a try ."

S'presentation : 12 oz brown long neck bottle , with no freshness date does that matter at 11.0 % abv ? appearance : pours a reddish mildly hazy amber colour with a lacing work to be proud of.. smell : rustic toasted malt with hints of mellowed solvent and ester alcohol aromas with a rip candied fruit nose . nearly a butterscotch and caramel aroma . taste : alcoholic character is still high but mellowing out in most ways . succulently smooth , with a creamy body . maltiness ranges from light caramel to chocolaty tones to a toasted husk flavour . hops are mild in comparison . big chewy sweet palate with ample toasted husk in the finish . notes : not a bad barleywine , it has mellowed out a bit though lets see how another year or two do for it .'

S"a deep copper color with a meager off-white head and fair lacing . the aroma is pretty intense butterscotch clover with heavy malt and lots of honey . wow ! anxious to see how this meade-like holiday madness translates . and the first mouthful immediately answers with chocolate covered cherries bathed in thick honey . there are still some `` scotchy '' hints but this is mostly about sweet malty holiday charm around the fireplace . it 's a solidly medium bodied brew with a near watery feel , minor carbonation . a fun brew worth enjoying while waiting for santa . probably not one to session unless the old fella is content to skip the rest of his route ."

S"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter . a : pours a very murky brown with a nearly nonexistent beige head . yeast particles floating freely . this bottle may be from a few years ago , just picked it up from a bottleshop as a single . the yeast reminds me of some really old belgians . s : a lot of sweet malt and more subdued bourbon in the background . t : sweet caramelized malt initially , followed by bourbon . the bourbon includes a lot of alcohol , but i think this may actually be higher than 11.1 % abv . it is bottle conditioned and may have continued to ferment in the bottle if it was n't stored properly , which may have been the case . m : the carbonation is there , but it is just a bit syrupy . d : i mean , this is a very strong brew , and i 've tried the blithering idiot , which i loved , as well as other bourbon barrel aged beers . none have been as strong in the alcohol presence except for the high abv dfh brews , like 120 minute , wws , and fort . so , i believe this bottle 's abv might be around 17-18 % by now , and it might have been aging in said store for at least 5 years . an interesting experiment , but the alcohol is quite a bit to handle in terms of finishing a 12 oz bottle alone . note : i picked this up at a bottle shop along with a probably similarly aged heresy and a 95 sam adams triple bock . i 'm hoping the other two are better , but from negative satb reviews , it does n't look promising and there 's a chance that the store has been storing these beers all room temperature . at least i know that the insanity & heresy can not be older than 6 years since they were both released in 2004 . overall , probably worth aging for at least 3-5 years , but under the proper cellar conditions , or at least ones that avoid the extreme summer heat that these brews probably have endured ."

S'pours out a hazed reddish amber with lots of bubble action and a decent sized head that stays put . smells like wort and grape nuts . has a pretty strong toasty quality as well . some light fruitiness . taste is not as worty as the smell , but it still is a big part of the overall flavor profile . it also brings on a lot of fig preserves and dates with some toasted almonds . yeast is pretty subdued but add a vague belgian character to it . kind of sweet for me . mouthfeel is about moderate with a smooth , soft and subdued carbonation . drinkability is really hurt by the sweetness and the wort quality .'

S"the aroma coming off the pour was a lot of fun . it was sweet and spicy and strong ... i wanted to just sniff for a while . this looks exactly like a cream soda and has a somewhat similar taste . the honey gives it plenty of sweetness while the grapes steer the flavor . the result is something like grape bubblicious , but in a restrained , non-offensive way . i could n't drink too many of these in a session ; either the sweetness or the abv would overwhelm me ."

S'appearance- pours a very clear amber/orange , with continueing efervecance and a an off-white head that is bigger than the whole outdoors . attempts to stick to the sides of the glass , but the head is so heavy that it leaves very little lacing . aroma- incredibly fresh hops with undertones of pine , and a very nice malt sweetness . also a tad of citrusy hops as it warms . taste- wow ! huge hop flavors dominate everything . you can sense a subtle underlying malt and malt sweetness character , but hops almost overpower the maltiness of it . you also get hints of an earthiness that is incredibly enticing . if you are a hophead , you will love this . mouthfeel- fairly thick without being heavy . just the perfect amount of carbonation to make it dance over your toungue without deadening your tastebuds . drinkability- not great . as a hop-head , ilove it , but a full bottle will give me heartburn . one is the perfect amount tho ! ! ! !'

S"served in a sam adams sensory pint glass . i remember trying this one when it first came out and strongly disliking it . figured i 'd give it another shot after `` developing my palate '' ( i hate using that phrase , as it really sounds kinda wine- ( or anything- ) snobby , but i ca n't easily come up with a better one ) . it pours a hazy clemson-auburn ( why should auburn be the only tiger-based school with a color , hm ? ) topped by a short-lived half-finger of white foam . the nose comprises mandarin oranges , lemon zest , light cardamom , and light toffee . unfortunately for these elements , they 're all covered by a thick fog of mccormick 's vodka , plastic bottle and all . sad , really . if it had meshed somewhat nicely , like a strong screwdriver or something , it would 've been fine , but this is just too much . the taste is more of the same , with a bit more orange this time 'round ( moving closer to a peel , though ) . it 's just an overly boozy mess of a taste , just like the smell , but is somehow less astringent . i ca n't explain it , either . the body is a hefty medium , with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta sticky feel . overall , this is just too much for what it might even want to be . the booziness is so omnipresent and malignant that i really do n't want to continue drinking this very much , much less get any more bottles ."

S"a - an excellent looking beer . it pours a nice deep brownish black with a massive light creamy-brown head . no lacing s - offputting to say the least . it has a nice bitter dark chocalate aroma , with a hint of sweetness . however that is hugely overpowered by the smell of vinegar and burnt coffee ( not to be confused with a nice roasty coffee flavor ) . t - it taste exactly the same as above ... except worse . it taste like watery burnt coffee at less than room temp . that is followed by the same vinegar flavor that seems to have a hint of worcestshire in it as well . m - okay - better than average . a slight creaminess . its hard to concentrate on hte moutfeel , with a taste this off putting . d - 1 ... poured down the drain . this is a `` quality control view '' . i have had this beer once before and it was nice ; very sweet and creamy with hints of chocolate and coffee . however , i bought a 6 pack of this a few days ago and this is the second beer from the group . i was hoping the first beer was a fluke ... they were both terrible . this may or may not have been the breweries fault , but i write this review so that people can be aware ( perhaps just people who buy their beer in tallahassee or publix ) that this beer may not be up to par ."

S'dark coppery-bronze amber in hue , clear i think . my pint glass is heavily frosted ; i hate nothing more when brewpubs do this ! slightly off-white head , the bubbles were one finger tall . head retention was decent , the foam faded to a thin cap . there was no subsequent lacing . i really like the liquids color ; otherwise this is a decent looking beer . through the bitter cold i can smell caramel malts with biscuit hints . i get hints of earthy hops . the potency is low and its not saying much . the bouquet is not offensive but it is not inviting either . the palate is mild cold , limp , with agreeable undercurrents of caramel , biscuit malts . sadly there are hints of metal . earthy hops , light bitterness at the end ; slightly fruity at times , clean finish . this beer has potential but if falls short of being really good . at best id call the flavor profile decent . okay , maybe just acceptable . medium light in body , watery mouthfeel , low carbonation , the mouthfeel is uneventful . it is as weak as the palate , in some regards . easy to drink but forgettable , it is a bit off as it warms . ive had much better amber ales . no matter , i am glad i finally a beer from high noon . sampled at the brewpub . one was enough .'

S"24 oz into a duvel tulip . a : pours a deep brown , almost black , with a nice creamy brown finger head . seems to be lacing pretty good as the head settles . s : maple ( go figure ) , sweet malts , deep fruit , alcohol , some hop on the nose , also a candy/sugary note . smells great , although not outrageously aromatic . i 'm dipping my nose pretty deep into this glass to get a nice whiff . t. very sweet , a unusually sweet sugary note is the first taste , followed by roasty , bready dark malts . some diacetyl flavors in here . finishes sweet and quite hot with some strong , nearly solvent-like fusels , ends with a delicious candy-like caramel flavor on the tongue that tastes more and more like maple sugar as you let it sit . certainly has a host of stout-like characteristics , but the dark malts are always secondary in intensity to the strong sweetness throughout . every now and again , there 's a strong taste which is distinctly maple syrup-induced . slight hop bitterness throughout lingers on the tongue and is probably the only thing keeping the lasting sweetness from becoming cloying . mf : thick . i 've described beers as syrupy before , but damn , this thing takes the cake . low carbonation makes this a heavy beer on the tongue , gooey , sticky ... pour it on pancakes thick . drinkability : comparatively low for a whole host of reasons that i just mentioned . plus , it 's quite strong indeed . as a novelty ... it 's pretty interesting . this is not something i 'd want to drink on a daily basis , however . the heat on the finish is increasingly coming across off-puttingly harsh as i drink it . the beer is exceptionally sweet , almost intolerably so . i wish there was a hoppier finish . this beer is delicious as it sits in your mouth , but around the time you swallow , rather than getting a balancing blast of hops to mellow out the sugary taste of this brew , you instead get an intense blast of even stronger sweetness which is frankly a little overwhelming . most upsetting to me is the mouthfeel of the beer , which is expectedly thick due to the maple-syrup , but is quite hard to handle , no matter how hard i try to appreciate it for being exactly what i anticipated . would n't it be possible to make a beer with maple syrup that feels like beer in your mouth ? this feels more like syrup . in the end , this is one hell of a sipper at 10.2 % and i 'm feeling every bit of the alcohol in my brain , and feeling every bit of this thick syrup marinating in my stomach . a"

S'12-ounce brown glass bottle poured into a tulip glass . served at approximately 45 degrees f. black as the blackest cup of joe , this one lets no light sneak through . a minimal head of light tan foam falls away fairly quickly , settling to a thin collar yet showing some nice rings and legs of stick as the glass empties . aroma is patently coffee , plain and simple , with a rich espresso character laced with notes of licorice . medium-full body with a moderate carbonation . dark-roasted coffee beans and semi-sweet chocolate set the stage for a palate that really follows suit , showing dry , moderately bitter espresso character throughout , made even more intense by a bit of herbal/citrus hop twang in the middle , with some hints of chocolate rounding out the edges before leading into an intensely dry hoppy-espresso finish that lingers for what seems like forever . quite good , the dryness really seems to call for another quaff , but with each draught it leaves you feeling incredibly dissatisfied . unlike intensely bitter pale ales and ipas , the intense level of roasted character here detracts immensely from the drinkability , coming across more like an actual cup of java than a beer that warrants drinking for any sort of extended period ( in fact , a shot-sized serving might actually be more appropriate ) . the 7.5 % abv is incredibly well-hidden , though , which is certainly a plus . overall , this is a decent coffee-infused stout , but a bit more restraint with the coffee would do this brew much more justice .'

S"a- bottle poured into a pint , straw yellow color , barely a half inch head that faded quickly , little to no lacing at all , good amount of carbonation . s- smells corny , little grassy notes too . t- tasted before i threw the lime in ( a key lime slice to be specific ) , tastes a little corny with a bit of a sweet sftertaste , tang from the lime , almost skunky flavor . m- thin , watery mouthfeel , good bit of carbonation , lime helps alot . d- for me it 's very drinkable for what it is , nice cold summer beverage . you do n't expect the world when you have a corona . and always add the lime ."

S"in my never ending quest to try all the pumpkin beers i could this year , i made a nice little trade with solomon420 for some west coast pumpkin beers , and get more kern river as i really enjoyed their 3rd anniversary . this beer hits both categories , so here comes a review . a : pours a bubbly 2 finger head that fades as quickly as it rose . it 's semi clear with some haze and the golden orange yellow color reveals the copious number of bubbles rising . n : hmm , not too bad . an obvious pumpkin aroma , with some toasted malt and toasted pumpkin . a slight sweetness and citrus , with some light spices . a big of malt as well . t : meh , its not bad , but nothing spectacular . starts as a nice light ale with some toasty malts and crystal malt flavors . some fruit and obvious pumpkin shine through , and bring a slight spice flavor with it . it 's semi watery taste as well . some pumpkin pie tastes shine through nicely . some other juicy fruit flavors come through , but otherwise very light . m : pretty light with tons of carbonation . f : finishes pretty dry and still light . the huge number of bubbles helps clear off the tongue well . a light spice flavor comes through a little more . pretty clean finish , and it would go well with spicy foods , esp indian food . final thoughts : very light ale , some nice pumpkin flavors , light on the spices ( thank god ! ) and some juicy fruit flavors . pretty light and crisp and airy . way too watery though , could use more flavor and body ( just not spices ) ."

S"12 oz . bottle , new labels , pastoral scene no more . poured a nice clear copper , very bubbly head , soda like , fades pretty fast leaving a faintest film on top . on the nose was , almost nothing , very subtle aromas of light herbs and grass and that was about it . the taste was light , a touch of caramel , some light fruit and smooth grains . very fizzy carbonation , a bit harsh . mid palette was watery with some metallic/mineral characteristics . finishes grainy and fast , very clean , too clean . the mouthfeel was very weak , fizzy , watery and light . overall - esb is probably my favorite style . weyerbacher 's version was just not very good . it was just too light and watery . no malt , no hops , nothing . snooze ."

S"presentation : 12 oz can . appearance : a quite vigorous pour produces a fluffy , large-bubble head which quickly fades . the beer itself is a crystal-clear , faint yellow hue . smell : adjuncts ... rice or corn ? and a funny tinny aroma as well . your basic macro-lager aroma ... just ... a lot less of it ... no real hops or malt presence taste : refreshing . but so is water . the very lightest hint of sweet malt and light grassiness , with a crisp , artificial metallic twang at the end . very little real flavor . mouthfeel : fizzy and ultra-light drinkability : you could drink these all night long ... but you could drink water all night long ... conclusion : it 's not really a real beer ... it 's the best selling beer in the world , but ... i 'll pass , thanks"

S"tonight 's choice was done by the gal . i have five bottles left , all suggested into a snifter ( my favorite ! ) , and i could n't make up my mind so i just had her toss one in the fridge . after i felt it had reached an appropriate temperature , it has been cracked and poured into my trusty glass and reviewed live . vision interesting , interesting . we have a vicious pour that generates half a finger 's worth of head of densely packed clear bubbles . intermingled amongst this population are some eggshell white pockets , but as i sit here notating things the head is gone . i 'm left with pond scum on the top of my glass and a thin filter straw of memory around the edge of my glass . if i had to describe this , it would be a moldy , not that punk ass bread mold , lemonhead kicked down my stairwell . bouquet thank good things that it is n't as nauseating as the candy it resembles . a single sniff caused me to jump backwards from this beer . if i take it at face value on the big inhale , i 'd put it somewhere between an ethanol bomb and box wine . this bad boy pumps out faint aromas of grapes mixed with the antiseptic qualities of ethanol . i also run into a faint vanilla nature undiluted and unmarred by anything , highlight of any sniff . some intermittent apple cores are rammed in , but immediately whisked off . the malts that , i hope these are the malts , come out faintly caramel and highly bread-like , tortilla ? flavor profile ugh , what is this . i must be an uneducated fool . this beer is doing things to me without my permission . my unlit apartment feels like a snuff film all of a sudden . heavy , heavy , heavy , flavors mask almost everything . an insatiably metal monster i like to call ethel rips into my tongue while his more pleasant buddies scatter to my esophagus . it is with many engagements of tongue-to-claw combat that i begin to enjoy some aspects . the apples do exist in the middle and finish of this beer . there is a small hop body that complement what the fruit brings to the table . another buddy is the malts , strongly reminiscent of a bread sandwich , extra bread . to put it in simple terms . this is two liquids entering my mouth at the same time . yeasty , carbonated , bready versus sweet , astringent , biting , and violent . it does not mix well at all , and it is a shame . oral sensations it ca n't be knocked here . a lack of carbonation in the vision does not transfer into the feel of this . it comes"

S"after a string of bad beers and realizing i need some space in my fridge to fit my most recent purchases from the lcbo , i decided that fuller 's usually has good stuff that will be able to break me out of this rut . got this one from ludachris , and it has a best before is 28/7/2010 appearance : clearly a bottle conditioned beer , as there is a large amount of yeasty sediment . produced only a finger of had that did lace and retain somewhat . the beer itself is a dark red copper color . smell : a very nice dried fruit smell , specifically noticing apricots . has a good background of malts and a bit of a dry hop smell . did n't take any warming to come out either . taste : starts with a very rich malt texture that gets quite a bit milder as you drink it that ends with a light dusting of dry hops . it 's nice , but not quite as fruity or diverse as i expected it to be . mouthfeel : well the carbonation is quite good and it transitions fairly well but it does leave a little bit too much of a dry sensation for my liking . the aftertaste is alright , but it does linger for a bit too long . drinkability : the dry texture really stops me from putting this down and it 's not all that refreshing . i mean no gas or bloating issues but it just does n't seem to do that much for me . it 's alright , but it just seems to be missing the mark . final thoughts : all in all , a good beer but i would n't say it 's exceptional . i certainly appreciated the fullers esb a lot more then this . it 's worth one try , but i would n't go past that ."

S'poured from my growler into a michelob fat tulip/pilsner design glass . ample 3-finger head is thick and off-white , moderate stability and retention , great lacing . the color is not very deep , its more of a golden bronze than an amber color . deep floral nose is nice and strong with a slight grassy note . no malt coming through , no counters balance . taste is nice , decent balance , distinct with a slight sweet bready malt taste going to an overall bitter and dry finish . not real heavy in the malt department , does not seem the focus . maltiness comes out more with temperature , revealing a lightly toasted bread taste . fitting mouthfeel ; low viscosity and ample carbonation , compliment the taste . great session beer if you like hops .'

S'12 ounce bottle also purchased from edelweiss deli in tehachapi on christmas eve for $ 2.00 , split tonight with my dad poured into my firestone pint glass with a golden yellow color , a small 1/4 inch soapy white head that settled pretty quickly , not much retention or lacing in this one smell was a little funky , pretty skunky with lots of hoppiness , strong lemon aromas , and a couple different kinds of malt taste was sharp and thirst quenching but not much flavor to it , a little watered down , the hops are pretty weak and you taste mostly bready accents and lager-like yeast , balanced overall because there was not much malt either , no sweetness at all , some citrus came to the surface once it had warmed but nothing to boast about , average taste overall that is fairly one dimensional body was nothing special but the carbonation was nice and it had a very crisp taste that would be very nice on a hot summer day , taste lasted a fair amount of time as well , not flat like other pilseners could probably drink a six pack of this based on its lightness and low abv , not filling and the taste does not get too old , goes down extremely easy and is very smooth first beer i have tried from this brewer also , had never heard of this one before either , probably would not drink again but not bad for a european pilsener'

S'500ml brown bottle ayinger altbairisch dunkel was clear and dark amber-red in color . it had a thick , rocky , light tan head with decent retention . it fit perfectly in a 22oz glass . the aroma was full of dark malt , slightly roasty . it has a malty taste , but is not really sweet , well balanced . it is medium in both body and carbonation . in my opinion this is the perfect session beer , good flavor , not too sweet , not too bitter , average alcohol content , and goes down really easy . this is one of my old favorites that i fall back to a couple times a year .'

S"dark dark dark dark dark , with a creamy quarter-inch head and persistent lacing . it 's not the solid black of guinness , but a deep chocolatey-mahogany brown . the head is tan to earthy . the chocolate in the beer is apparent in the nose . beyond that , it 's a stout very much like a lighter guinness or other mainstream cream stout . and that 's what it tastes like , too . there is a smooth nuttiness to the taste common to many english beers ; the chocolate complements the roasted malt flavor well . the flavor is quite round , and most present slightly chilled ; i would like to try this hot in winter , just to see what happens . hints of cinnamon and nutmeg that could , in my opinion , be a little bolder ( but not much ) . it 's surprisingly watery for the taste , and slightly dry . i think i was expecting it to be more like murphy 's , creamier . it 's good but gimmicky , like many other of the young 's line . the price does n't justify everyday drinking , but a four-pack makes a decent treat to show off ."

S'a - wow . it is a beautiful hue ; reminiscent of a les paul sunburst maple finish . the head is quickly relegated to random white wisps sans lace , but the color is so radiant that i will overlook that ... s - the aroma seems to strongly suggest the point in pie-baking where the total caramelization and the fusion of spice and gourd lets you know that the pumpkin pie is done ; time to take that bad boy out of the oven ! ! ! as such it is highly delectable , pervasive , and yet not overwhelming . t - the taste follows the aroma faithfully , with the only new perceptions lent by the roasty brown ale base ; the impression is that of washing down a bite of savory-sweet pumpkin pie with a swig of lightly toasty mild brown ale . m - lighter than medium , softly effervescent , and good overall . d - this is a damn good beer .'

S"crystalline yellow hued with a frothy stark white rise . scented of sourdough rolls and oily prairie grasses . the maltiness start in the sere direction of a pils- full of toast and saltine crackers- then blooms into a fuller and sweeter expression of wildflower honey , white grape , and pear . a more expansive breadiness ensues , and precedes a clover and dried herb hop closure that carries some weight . medium-light bodied , but taut and streamlined in structure . obviously , the helles-like appearance will freak out those that have never seen a paler version stateside , and many of them are more accustomed to o'fests that could pass for bocks ( or doppelbocks ) with their maltiness . this is all about finesse . and , actually , tradition ... and not just because a person could drink a bathtub of this ."

S"i have been waiting to try this one for a while now . thanks to my good friend greggy who through this into a 6 pack for me . excellent . a - good . very dark orange to light brown in color . huge head that when disappears , leaves a nice lacing around the class . not clear but cloudy all the way through . large amount of sediment left in the bottle of the bottle as a result of conditioning . s - malty . very little hops noticed . sweet bread with a touch of brown sugar ... .like the bread was just made but then put into the refridgerator . t - this is where all of the peanuts count . wow ... very strong complex beer . alcohol is indeed noticed . so many flavors , i do n't know where to start . most of the strong taste comes after the ale is allowed to start its path down the throat . this is when the tastebuds and nose start firing messages to the brain all at the same time . bitter but not too much for an old ale . nothing like an ipa . malt is present . this beer took some time to make . m - seems a bit thick for the style . sort of like pudding . i expect this with a milk stout but somehow , the mouthfeel is just a little too thick . it is like tasting sour bread that has n't been given the proper time in the oven to cook . this is the lowest score for me . a little too heavy . d - the bottle states that this is 10.2 % alcohol and ba says that it is closer to 9 % . either way , one bottle is enough even for the diehard . slow down and enjoy the taste . just do n't dwell on the mouthfeel . if you do , you wo n't like this beer . enjoy it for being from bells and the care that went into making it . so many flavors ... .maybe too many ."

S"the rocky , heterogenously sized bubbly beige head sits atop a dark garnet hued brew w/ excellent clarity if decanted off the sediment . the aroma is comprised of dominant citrusy fruitness both of a tart , lime - like character and a sweet orange peel note . as the brew breathes , peppery spice and lightly raisiny , slightly chocolately special b malt aromas emerge . surprisingly mellow aromawise . in flavor , sweetness is of a dark fruit character , with date - like sweetness dominating . hints of caramel from the dark candi sugar along with a light cidery note are present as well . biscuit malt and a touch of butter surface as the beer breathes , and then become the dominate malt foundation . esters are subdued , w/ trace bubblegum present . as the co2 dissapates , the body is revealed to be a touch thin . the initially prickly mouthfeel subsides into a relatively smooth one that does n't deter from sipping . finishes a touch sugary , but otherwise clean and dry . nocturnum is surprisingly tame , and lacks some of the quirky intensities that other dark strongs have . that being said , there are n't any flaws , the sweetness is well controlled and the drinkability is thus excellent . this bottle was farily young -- the cork was imprinted `` 2001 .

S"i first tasted this beer around 5 years ago and soon after it became rather scarce , also impossible to find , in the area of sc i was living in . i recently turned 21 and on my first beer buying expedition i was dumb founded to see this beer on the shelf . this , at the moment , is my favorite `` luxury '' beer . it is smooth and creamy with a caramel sweetness and a slightly sour aftertaste . when poured into a pint glass it looks like the perfect example of a stoutblack as night with a frothy brown head . this would be a great beer to introduce to those who think all dark beers are bitter ."

S"12oz single , scooped a sixer appearance : dull golden-orange body , foamy white crest with only light lacing smell : very nice but a little on the `` subtle '' side , fresh orange , tangerine , and grapefruit definitely present . light pine , lemon peel taste : i get why people arent going to go crazy for this one - it doesnt slam you over the head with hops ( for the record , im into that ) . there is a nice pale malt character , with well pronounced citrus , lemon , and honey . nice - do i like it as much as some of my staples ? no , but its a highly drinkable pale that is moving off the shelves very fast mouthfeel : lighter , crisp , refreshing drinkability : the pinnacle of drinkability"

S"i have never had an `` alcohol free/non-alcoholic '' beer before . till now . ( let the muted , neutered trumpets sound ... ) rather suspect looking from the start . incredibly clear piss-yellow color , with a wispy , almost dishsoap-looking white head . but , uh , if we 're supposed to review to style , i guess this looks okay , considering ... smell ? what smell ? if i get anything , it 's like a glass of water with a teaspoon of white grape juice added . okay , maybe a tablespoon . for a second , there was something about the taste that i thought i liked . but it quickly got very weird . again i 'm reminded of white grape juice . but there 's also a sweetness like splenda or some other non-sugar sweetener , and something kind of bitter or astringent , but not in that good hoppy way ... more like chewing on a grape vine or some other such roughage . i knew from the second sip there was no way i was going to finish this bottle . i guess it feels okay . it 's lightly carbonated . must be very drinkable at .3 % , huh ? bullshit . no way should this trangression ever be done to beer , but it has been . at least i did n't buy it . a-v-o-i-d or forever disgrace yourself ."

S"a proud devil displays his glass on the bottleneck , and i 'm eager to join him in raising a chalice to down this much anticipated ale . color , dark brown with tall , but quickly dissipating darkish head . aroma is very vinous , dominated by dark fruits , cherries and grapes , sweet , like a port wine , but not too dark and syrupy , actually feeling more like a cherry soda taste : a blast of hops on the palate , with a full body , and persistent flavor , thick , but somewhat cloying in the texture , full of sweet and strong fruitiness , then the sour kicks in , again , and again , and the body thins some , with the sour character winning over . feels a bit like a flat grape soda , perhaps i 've gotten a bad bottle ? ... so i said in april of '03 in my little beer review notebook and i was determined to give it another chance , which came along in june ... '' beautiful , deep dark ruby hue , nice , highly carbonated , darkish head ... fruity , grapey , spritzy , deep , heady , full , but missing a lot , just grape juicy , like the other one , flat and lacking in yeast , malt , hops ... '' i 'd been assured that my suspicion that this poor taste was a result of a bad bottle was far from fact , by several , including the beer 's creator , who suggested that perhaps i just do n't like that kind of beer . could i be the only cretin on god 's green earth who does n't like this beer ? well , i 've since seen similar sentiments posted and come forth now as not a lone heretic , but sure in my sentiments that what ever was in these bottles was not what i was looking for , nor anything that i can rightly enjoy . it just ai n't all that good . there , i said it ... ... and i thank jeffboo for the bottles ! ( for what it 's worth , i liked premiere and blessing quite a bit ! )"

S'500ml bottle . no date . orangey honey amber . slight haze . fine foam , 1.5 finger head , fades to thin layer , consistently replenished . nice lacing , with several thick , webby rings . light pine and faint citrus rind in the aroma , plus some grassy euro hops too . some toasted , caramelized malt , with hint of apple and yeast , but everything is all a bit subdued . more light pine and citrus rind in the flavor , then more grassy and resinous with moderate bitterness . malt has caramel tones but is ever so slightly diluted again . yeast hint and trace of apple fruitiness before a slightly resinous , mildly bitter finish . slightly watery feel , but still smooth . finish is crisp with touch of resins . mildly fizzy , micro-bubble carbonation . always nice to see the brits give american hops a try .'

S"paid $ 1.79 for a 16oz bottle from discount liquor in milwaukee , wi . pour into a snifter to review . pour is not very thick , leaving a half inch of white , tight-knit head . color is dark copper that takes on transparent qualities and a more orange hue when held to the light . minimal head retention and some lacing . quite balanced in the nose , this is one of the sweeter dipas i 've smelled to date . has a candy-like medicinal quality similar to an elixir you 'd give to your kid when sick . hops are present yet very balanced with the brew , making it difficult to throw any adjectives in front of them . taste seems to be a bit off to me . caramel malts and raw adjunct taste dominate . hops almost completely at bay . balance that i detected in the nose is lacking . as i drink more , it takes on an unpleasant metallic taste . mouth is rather unimpressive with a moderately dry finish , medium body and watery feel . ok carbonation . tough one to finish . they need to go back to the drawing boards on this one as it has missed its mark . i 'll stick to their black bavarian which is a great representation of an authentic baravian schwarzbier ."

S"this is way better than anticipated . i do n't really like many american wheat beers , especially the overly sweetened ones that follow in the flavor of blue moon . i do enjoy the german wheats in general with their dryer flavor . this beer is a bit more similar to those with a strong similarity to a belgian ipa . the color is really light straw in color . the smell is a bit astringent and sour . the taste is light but with a slight citrus flavor . the after taste is nice and light . this beer is great for a summer day and i would be happy to drink this all day while sitting on a nice beach ."

S'we just got weyerbacher in mn so im excited to try their whole line . this quad pours out very dark brown with very limited head . seems very clear with little sediment . smell is molasses , dark fruit , and a bit of funky yeast and spice . very inviting . i am immediately disappointed by the taste . the flavors of dark fruit , funk , and malt seem subdued . all this makes the taste seem thin and watered down with a lack of carbonation . the mouthfeel follows the flavor . thin , as if they didnt add enough of all of the ingredients . this quad is lacking in flavor and substance . drinkable , because of lack of overwhelming flavoring , but the lack of carbonation detracts .'

S"a slow trickle of a pour yielded a black as night brew , with a bit 3 finger puffy , chocolate marshmallow looking head ! looked like a glass of chocolate syrup , with some chocolate mousse on top ! mmm aroma was nice , with hints of coffee , cocoa nibs , and a slightly bittersweet nose . there was surprisingly no booze on the nose at all . got the booze on the taste though , but it was not overpowering , and a little expected . chocolate , coffee , bittersweet coffee , roasted , toasted malts and some burnt sugar . one of the thickest brews i 've had ! chewy , coating , full bodied . cant ask for much more ! easy to drink 1 , but this thing is so big , any more than that would be daunting . overall , excellent and i look forward to hunting this down again !"

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter . very little head to speak of and whatever is there does n't last long . it pours a cloudy yellow with some orange hues . i feel like it would 've been pretty clear if some of the yeast had n't found it 's way into the glass . the aroma is of sweet banana and a peppery spicy . there is an earthy quality to the aroma which may be from the hops . the flavor is very full with a lot of the peppery qualities shining through . the typical banana sweetness is very much present . not sure what kind of hops they used but i 'm detecting some saaz in the body of the beer . there is a bit too much much sweetness that may bring down the level of drinkability . the mouthfeel is right where it should be . not too heavy but assertive at the same time . the beer also has a great deal of carbonation to tickle your tongue . this is a pretty good triple that did a very nice job rounding out the flavors . my only critique is that i wish they would 've dried it out a bit more . btw : there are some great banana burps with this one ."

S"had this beer tonight at rock bottom in boston on stuart st . fantastic ! the appearance was a light golden-amber . it had great , tight lacing that continued the entire way down the glass . the smell was also fantastic , and alluded to the bitter , citrusy taste . opposed to other ipas which might overdo either the alcohol or the malt profile , this did neither . i think it had a great bitter character , while maintaining its drinkability . the hops were decidedly more citrusy than rustic , and the aftertaste kept one wanting for more ! it might have been because the brew was on tap , but this was one of the best ipas i 've had in recent times and would definitely go back for a growler ."

S"this beer is black with one finger tan head , no lacing . chocolaty malt , hint of vanilla , and mild mint come through in the nose . a bit spicy . sweet from vanilla to counter the bitter chocolate in taste with a bit of alcohol burn at the end . medium viscosity for the style , and well carbonated . this is an interesting beer , if underwhelming . there is a good deal of vanilla that could come off as sweet with any other beer , but the bitter malt profile balances it well . i just do n't get much kick with this beer . it 's a bit uninspired , despite the amount of ingredients they put into it . i do n't get any hot spiciness from the peppers , which is a bit of disappointment . i 've had chipotle beer , so i can attest to the spiciness that is capable in beer . it 's okay ; not worth seeking out ."

S"appearance : cloudy yellow-orange . blue moon seems to be much more pale than other beers of this style . the foamy head dissapates very quickly , too . smell : the smell is n't bad , but it 's not overwhelmingly good , either . it at least tries to bring out some of the citrus notes . taste : blue moon is what it is . it 's by no means a fine beer , but the taste is enjoyable , if not somewhat lacking compared to other beers of this style . it is , nonetheless , fairly tasty and something that i find pleasing . mouthfeel : this where i was least impressed with blue moon . i had gone several months without drinking it , and when i returned the mouthfeel was less than stellar . this is very much a macrobrew and feels fairly watered-down , and when you couple this with it 's taste the lack of presence leaves you wanting more . drinkability : very high . this is a beer that 's fairly refreshing and due to it 's more watery character can be drunk pretty frequently or in a session . due to the lack of concentration of flavor , it 's really easy to drink a lot of this in searching for more taste ."

S"came in a foil wrapped bomber . there is not freshness date and it is marked `` malt liquor , '' probably because some of these are sent to the southern states . pours a hazy copper . the head is big , white , and rocky at first . after a couple of minutes it settles into a thin quarter-inch head that is there until the last drop . it smells like fresh grain , and also somewhat grassy . the taste is much the same . you are also hit with a little bit of sweetness . it finishes with a bit of citrus . the mouthfeel is good , not too thick , and not to thin . this would probably be a refreshing beer after you 'd been outside sweating on a hot summer 's day . i 'm not sure how fresh this was , but the drinkability does n't seem very high . it was n't hard to drink , but i was n't extremely encouraged to get to the bottom of my pint glass either . notes : i have to admit that i am not really a fan of wheat beers . i revisit them from time to time in hopes that my palate will accept them . i had the day off today so i decided to pick up a beer to go with my lunch . i saw this in the cooler and decided i 'd try wheat beers again . i tried to rate it on the style , not my personal taste preference . the only wheat beer i 've found that i really like to drink regularly is bells oberon ."

S"thanks to nickd717 for this valuable iowa tick . the bottle cap reads twist off . it 's not a twist off and my hand is now permanently mangled . wtf ? midnight express glugs out of the bottle a decidedly residential speed flat black . there 's almost no carbonation , giving it the appearance of a glass of molasses . it smells like a glass of molasses . there 's also milk chocolate sweetness and licorice , perhaps a bit of butter toffee . actually , this smells just like an oatmeal raisin cookie . not too bad , really . taste is pretty good . lots of molasses and toffee , with a backbone of rich milk chocolate , or maybe just chocolate milk . the mouthfeel , likewise , reminds me of chocolate milk ; extremely viscous , syrupy , frankly under-attenuated and a bit flat . roasted malt lends a bit of coffee-like acidity . it finishes with flavors of oatmeal , smoked meat and licorice . the snobs in my tasting group were slamming this beer , but i think it 's pretty decent stuff . it could use more carbonation , maybe a bit more finesse , but the flavors are nice and it displays a decent level of depth . on the downside , it 's hard to drink more than 4 or 5 ounces because it 's so damn rich and syrupy ."

S'a : pours an orange color with a bit of haze and frothy off-white head . s : initial smells of grassy and earthy hops , a hint of grapefruit . faint smell of malt lingers in the background . t : grassy hops . come across very dry in the mouth . losing the grapefruit flavor that i could smell . not much malt character to balance the hops . a bit to grassy for my likes . m : light to medium body . very carbonated , too much for this type of beer . d : somewhat unbalanced . high amount of carbonation makes it hard to drink .'

S'pours a clear amber the color of a rich speyside single malt , with little in the way of a head . the smell is a nice balance of malt and hops , caramel malts on one side , earthy , minty hops on the other . i get a hint of diacetyl , too . on the palate , full bodied for the style , with medium carbonation . easy drinking . flavorwise , this is mild and sessionable , with light , fruity esters laid on top of sweetish malts , with a finish dried out by subdued english hop notes . overall a wonderful session beer , easy to imbibe and fun as well .'

S"16oz camouflage can that was left at my house at a party last friday ... i probably will never buy it.. sooo.. i figured wtf . poured into my shaped sa glass ... aggressive pour.. 3/4 '' head ... and actual lacing to my surprise.. brew is crystal clear straw . pale malts and corn . very clean.. no hops . flavor is `` beer '' .. pale malts with a little bit of shucked corn.. a little bready.. not offensive ... just everything is expected ... i guess i should not be surprised . body and carbonation ... yada yada yada.. you know it . i would think that this is the first time i 've had the champagne of beers in probably 10+ years.. all and all.. i am not unimpressed.. it is what it is ... and it is n't bad . i have to say ... i would n't turn one down if it was offered . 3.5/3/3/2.5/4"

S"dry , peppery , and rather austere ale . any traces of malty sweetness seem to have disappeared . quite sharp and with a very thin mouthfeel . looks quite nice with its pale lemony color and nice lacing . tastes more like a very dry saison seasoned with pencil shavings . hops emerge with a long bitterness . aroma reminds me of drying concrete . very coarse carbonation , which may be a product of more age than is good for it . i like this style , but i do n't think this is a very good representative . the more i sip the more odd this tastes , like it has discovered a new kind of bacteria . this is not really bad beer , it is just such a peculiar and unfriendly flavor i leave it to others to decipher it ."

S"this beer was a second choice after my first choice was sold out . however , i was happily surprised with the texture of the beer and the underlying flavors that ranged from a sweet malt to a wine-like finish with hints of fruits . however , not in the sense of a beer brewed with fruit , rather a more distinct character and texture that i have not seen replicated since then . its not my favorite , but would gain a recommendation for sure . my only complaint is that the flavor is so prevalent and `` unique '' that it does not go well with too many foods , and drinkability is diminished ."

S"okay , this is a bit disappointing , but not bad . i like blueberries . alot . i eat them daily . i grow them . near where i live , they grow wild . i collect them . being a type 1 diabetic , they are supposedly good for me . not sure how , but i use that as an excuse to eat more blueberries . so , when i saw a blueberry beer , i got a little excited . it pours alot like a typical mass produced lager . compare it with molson canadian , and i 'll be damned if i can tell a difference . pale straw yellow , next to no head . at first , the smell was strong of blueberries . you pop the cap , and the room fills with the scent of blueberries . after your nose adjusts , or the scent dies down , you can smell some flowery tones , cracker like malt , and something sweet . not sure what it is . for that initial burst of blueberry smell , the taste is relatively weak . tastes like , well , a macro lager with blueberries . okay , perhaps not that bad . their is a definite blueberry taste , with some dry malts , honey ( that sweet smell ? ) and some bitter/floral hops . however ... the taste does not fit . does n't blend together . the blueberries , which in this beer only seems to be sweet and have little if no tartness , goes terrible with the bitter and floral hops . the dry malt and honey sweetness are barely distinguishable . sad . mouthfeel is very light bodies and spritzy . drinkable ? sorry , no . the clashing of the blueberry and hops ruins it . however , i 'm not off blueberry beer . i noticed another brand at the lcbo . hopefully they 'll have some more blueberry tartness . or , at least not be as disappointing ."

S"duke `` european-style premium lager '' 330ml bottle , best before 29.04.08 . appearance : pale gold-yellow lager , low head retention , extremely low carbonation . lacing is patchy and only slightly persistent . underwhelming first impression . smell : with no head , it 's hard to get anything out of it , even though it 's a warm morning on the gold coast and my senses should be at their sharpest . faintly sweet grassy aromas , maybe a little bit of fruity yeastiness but that 's about it . taste : quite refreshing , and sweeter than i anticipated . peach flavours , some mildly bitter hops , some citrus zestiness . not overly complex , but satisfying and definitely better than the appearance and smell of the beer would have you believe . mouthfeel : extremely lousy . since this beer is practically flat the instant you crack the lid , there is n't much to get excited about in the mouth . no fizz , just a bland heavy-water feel in the mouth . drinkability : because it feels like you 're drinking dishwater , albeit dishwater that tastes like a good beer , the flat mouthfeel cloys really quickly . i bought a case of these but was disappointed . the first couple of beers are nice and satisfying , but you ca n't get excited about the prospect of drinking this all night . which is hard for me to understand , because i love beer , especially craft brewed . why do n't i enjoy drinking this ? because it 's flat ! overall : i 've tried this on tap at the surf club as well as in the bottle , and i complained to the bar staff , thinking they had n't flushed the lines properly or that there was a pressure leak or something . i had a second one after they 'd checked everything and replaced the keg , and it was still flat . the first mouthful or two in the schooner glass was great , but it got old fast . worth a try i suppose , because there 's not much else on offer up here ! although i did manage to pick up a case of dos equis for $ 25 - ridiculously cheap . even that was more satisfying than this locally brewed craft beer ! but overall this is a let-down . i have n't tried the pale ale yet though , so i wo n't write off this brewery altogether ."

S'my first experience in the flemish art of brewing- new and exciting . brew poured a deep dark mahogany , with a slighlty effervescent head . aromas were strong on malts- sweet molasses , somewhat yeasty finish with an almost vine-like quality . taste was big- my mouth puckered as the big sweetness was replaced by dry sourness . a combination of dried raisens , cherries and aged balsamic . tingling carbonation allowed the earthy woodiness to come through and beat down the sourness somewhat . heavy bodied in my opinion , it had the qualities of a good port with a sour kick . i had to sip this one , as my palate was overwhelmed . a must-try , but i expect it would take a more refined palate to make this one a go to brew .'

S"another thanksgiving day treat split with jwiss22 . love pumpkin beers and how much better they make fresh pumpkin pie taste . here goes ... a- a very nice pour yields a darker amber color that is not expected , but very appealing to gaze at . darker than pumking and looks just as appetizing . a very nice stream of bubbles presents a thin white head that dissipates quickly . i love how it looks reminds me faintly of lighter pumpkin bread . ca n't wait to indulge . s- right away a greeting of fresh pumpkins followed by nutmeg , cinnamon and i want to say clove . quite intriguing and lovely to smell . i am picking up more of the spices as it warms they are overpowering the pumpkin and leaving it in the back . it 's making me drool as this is one of my favorite seasonal styles . t- tons of the nutmeg , cinnamon and other spiciness used in pumpkin pies . lovely taste not a lot of pumpkins very faint because it is dominated by the spices used . as it warms i get a subtle crust taste , but not as much as i would like because the spices take over . m- coats the mouth and leaves you awaiting your next sip . the carbonation is there and melds well with all the spices leaving them lingering around . enjoyable , but a little chewier than others , probably the malt bill chiming in to leave it fuller bodies than some pumpkin brews . d- as like most of this style its a desert beer not a session beer . it is to be enjoyed with pumpkin pies , sweet potato pies , cranberry sauce . for the high abv its fairly drinkable , but i will stick to the tried and true pumking for now . a great representation for the style , up there with the greats of this style . very pleasing and would try again next season to see if the recipe changes . would like more pumpkin less spice or maybe even a vanilla pinch to throttle down the cinnamon and nutmeg ."

S'~ purchased this bottle at shoreline beverage in huntington , ny . chocolatey , smooth , rich , and creamy are the best words to describe this classic stout . i wonder how much better this would be if the 5.2 % abv was bumped up a couple notches ? still , a real pleasure to drink , and i see myself revisiting this one again really soon ! ~'

S"poured from a 12oz stubby bottle into a sierra nevada pint glass : appearance : pours a beautiful light gold in color , nice thick rocky head , very dense , excellent retention , good lacing as well . smell : grassy like hop elements emerge beautifully , a huge boquet of citrus merges nicely with a small amount of malt spice . a bit of orange creeps in the backdrop . taste : very pilsner like in the front , small bits of hoppiness are here , a bit of orange again from the aroma , slick & buttery , some earth like maltiness is small and subtle , very crisp and refreshing . the finish consists of a small amount of alcohol bite which is very enjoyable . end notes carry on from the aroma with a touch of toast from the malt and some earth like flavoring . mouthfeel : carbonation is n't too big on this beer , which helps out the overall mouthfeel , again it 's slick in some spots , but holds up nicely on the tongue . light bodied and leaves a nice crispness on the palete . drinkability : summer beers can be hard to like , everybody loves a bigger beer but when it 's 90 degrees and sunny you need something to quench your thirst and at the same time keep your interest . this beer does it . sn provides all the drinkable characterisitcs to make this a go-to summer beer for the craft beer drinker or the bmc head . i can see lounging on the shore with a few of these or even cracking one open after a long day of work in the sun . very drinkable and refreshing . well done !"

S"clear deep red with a thin head . scent is fruit and raisin . i also picked up an odd whiff of what resembled chili powder . not a big fan of the taste . there are some wierd things going on in there . i pick up some raisin , a light spiciness of hops , and again that chili powder referenced in the scent . the body is heavily carbonated and thin . this takes a major hit in mouthfeel because of an off-putting chemical like astringency in my mouth , almost like a houshold cleaning product . overall , i found this beer unenjoyable and just not working together at all . i do n't think this is a bad bottle in any way , there were just too many combinations that did n't work well ."

S'a - pours a bright golden color , partly hazy , with substantial white head that leaves lacing as it recedes to a creamy/soapy topping s - sweet malts , a touch of grass , sweet citusy scents , and subtle hops t - hints of tangerine peel , sweet , sugary malts with a bit of honey maybe , hints of wheat and grass , and just a touch of alcohol m - medium-bodied and very smooth with a tingle of carbonation in the finish d - about as drinkable as they come in my book ... reminds me of something in between a pilsner and a tripel , blended with a wit , retaining the abv of the tripel . basically a damn good drinkable summer beer with a bit more of a kick than most'

S"jupiler seems to be one of the standard beers found in your simple village cafe . it is there for tosing back when you just want a cool quick beer with no challenges to the palate . although i have had this many times on tap today 's sample comes from the 25cl brown bottle . it pours pale yellow and very clear . a nice light white head forms and fades back to a thin layer that covers the beer to the end of the glass . which came in four swallows . i have to pour another to finish this review . okay , back with you . i find the beer very easy to drink . the slight touch of bitterness cleans the mouth of the lighty sweet initial taste . it gives a full feeling in the mouth . overall a very neutral and thirst quenching sort of taste . with much effort i find an ever so faint cinnamon like smell , but that is searched . this is not a bad session beer . at 5.2 % you can knock back a few . i know i have done this more than once over the years . not a bad beer and worth a drink , but i would n't drive across town just to find one ."

S"sampled this many times at brewfests and decided to sit down with this one at gitchee gumee . glimmering clear jello rust . no head , but that is expected of the no carbonation braggot . nose is light but largely malty with a high end sweetening of honey and candied melon . tangy wine-likeness to its presence . light notes of spicy dry hardwood forest leaves floats past . intense thick malt of honey and caramel sweetness and super ripe fruits of melon , grapes , apples , and apricot slip inbetween a big oak wood center thats quite tangy and renders a malt vineger without the salt . dashes of spice and dried leaves spring to life after the winey vinegar flavors start to fade . but what really makes all this sound and taste better is its amazing heft and unimaginable cloying thickness . its like a syrupy wine . super heavy , super sticky , and largely cloying . the sweetness is never overly harsh , but it definatley pushes the envelope . another envelope pusher , yet unmentioned , is the 10 % . oh its there , it sits heavy like everything else but waits til the end to poke its fiery head up out of the thickly sweet vinous murk . drinkability ? is there such a thing with braggots ? so sweet , so thick , soooo cloying and sticky . sip is n't the proper word for it . i 'll say slow goin ' . its as drinkable as malt vinegar . you can only handle so much before your taste buds begin screaming for you to stop ."

S"the 2000 edition , 12 ounce bottle into a chimay goblet . a pretty looking beer , but not too noteworthy for the style . it 's a mahogany color with a slightly offwhite head ; not much head or lacing to speak of . smells ... sharp ; an odor that reminds me of perfume . there are fermented fruit odors to be found that might remind some people of garbage but for the most part i like it . i taste all kinds of raisins in this . i have n't had green raisins in a long time ( which the bottle says this is brewed with ) but i certainly taste golden and dark raisins . this is not as deep or complex as others i 've had of the style but the straightforwardness has an appeal . the mouthfeel is a bit sticky sweet that lingers for a little longer than i 'd like . the carbonation is appealing and there is a tang that i like . overall i like this brew and would say it 's worth a try to those that like sweeter tasting brews . the 8 % alcohol is absolutely deceptive in this ."

S'aroma is a standard wheat bier smell with a mingling of sugar and spice that bring it dangerously close to belgium smell categories appearance is dark brown with red highlights , very carbonated bearing a huge head with great retention.. although no lacing tastes strongly of cloves and sugar which give a sense of mystery and strength to this beer , although at 8 % it is insanely drinkable and way too thirst quenching . despite the significant lack of aftertaste , this beer is very complex and waddles through the dark fruit taste profile reminding me of some of my favorites'

S"pours the standard golden yellow with a bubbly white head that laces and retains moderately well . aroma is what you would expect from the style -- a relatively weak grain smell with , for whatever reason , definite hints of metal . taste mimics the smell with a mild grain sweetness that fades into slightly bitter hop notes . body is light and carbonation is high . drinkability is fine if you want a very light beer that holds off on flavor . this combined with the low abv means you could put back several on a hot day , but i would n't recommend it on anything beyond it 's refreshing qualities . not bad , not good , just a standard macro adjunct lager . also , the cap is cool !"

S"another winner at andechs , and from a style that does n't get a lot of recognition over here in the us , but likely should . dunkel lager is my default brew of choice in most situations where it 's available . came out a nice dark color with a little bit of reddish highlights , but fewer than most . head was a perfect 3/4 inch . smell is caramel , cola , chocolate , grain , and even a little hops buried in there . flavor is rich and malty . some dunkel 's seem to taste just like an overmalted helles lager , but not this one . this is a bold brew that can take on bock-like flavors . mouthfeel is a little thicker than i 'd like ( this is the only flaw from andechs , imo ... they tend to go against the grain with the thickness/thinness of their brews ) , but it 's still nothing to complain about . drinkability is limited only by the hours the monastary or hall in munich are open ! edit : i think i was being a little too kind to this beer in my first review . it 's really good , but there are better dunkels out there . augustiner and ayinger in particular come to mind . after my 4th visit , i definitely think i overstated this one a bit ... but it 's still a great beer and one of the better ones around . it 's probably worth noting that this beer is usually only available at the smaller biergarten about halfway up the hill at andechs . it 's not available in the bierhall on top of the hill or at am dom at all ."

S"one of my favourite beers of all time . pours a murky , dark brown beer with a thick , large and stubborn head . chocolate , dark/plummy fruits and spices batlle it out in the smell . there 's is also a faint alcohol smell present . the taste is dark , rich and rather malty . deifinitely not as sweet as you would think though . the 9,2 % alc . 'hits pretty hard ' and warms the throat somewhat . pairs excellent with 'stoofvlees ' and other meat dishes as well . definitely on par with the rochefort 10 and very close to the chimay grande rserve ( blue cap/label ) wich i still like little better than this one . nonetheless , ... a world-class beer !"

S"lots of caramel malt and floral hops in the aroma . some citrus hop too . nice golden color and totally clear . started with a a very small head that is just a little island of foam and a small ring around the edge after a minute . no rising carbonation at all . kind of lifeless . very good malty start . lots of caramel and toasted marshmellow . then the bitterness kicks in . pretty high hop bitterness but not crazy especially for the style . there 's a nice spicy yeast component too that seems a little like pepper with the usual ale fruit yeast . as it warms up i get a little butterschotch diacetyl . body is pretty big and syrupy with a light carbonation so it does feel a little heavy . and at 9.5 % is this really a dipa or a strong ale/barleywine ? it feels very alcoholic in my throat and stomach . tough one to rate for drinkability . i really like the flavors but it seems so heavy . i would n't consider drinking more than a pint not because it 's strong but because it is so filling ."

S'color : pours brown . sits clear copper-brown smell : good malt aroma . light fruity notes . no hop aroma . light melanoidins . hint of adjunct noticed taste : malty sweet . slightly bready/toasty with a hint of fruity esters . noticable adjunct flavor . very low bitterness though somewhat more prominent in the finish . finish is somewhat dry and lingering is minimal mouthfeel : smooth medium body with moderate carbonation notes : decent bock but not enough alcohol and the adjunct flavor is disappointing . still a decent beer to go for if you want a dark , flavorful lager'

S"english pale ales are n't the sexiest style ever , but brooklyn has nailed it with their summer release . a : one of the best english pales i 've seen . pours a wonderful light golden color with a one finger head . plenty of lacing . s : aroma is n't out of this world . all `` bready '' malt on this one . t : crisp & refreshing . the bready malt dominates with the hops finally showing up at the end providing a citrus finish . m & d : low abv . good carbonation with a light body . perfect beach beer ."

S"pours a light amber/golden with a nice billowy head , and lots of carbonation bubbles floating to the top . retention is very good , and the lacing stays locked onto the side of the glass . light hops across the nose . dry hopped , but only just barely enough to warrant the labeling . bready yeastyness , more or less dominates here . smooth across the palate with a fair amount of hops . to even things out . light bitterness , and a little citrus from the hops , come through at the start , but dissapear rather rapidly , leaving a very lager-like sweetness on the tongue ? is this normal michelob but with more hops ? very smooth across the tongue , almost velveteen . a lower than normal ( for bmc ) carbonation is very nice and stylisticly prefferable . overall i think this is a very good english pale ale from a company with a bad rep amongst beer geeks . not by far the best pale ale i 've ever had , but for what it is it 's good . it could introduce more light lager drinkers to the world of full flavored ales , and that 's never a bad thing"

S"notes from march '09 poured from a 12 oz . bottle into a wiezen glass . appearance is pleasing with a nice cloudy golden straw hue and a well carbonated head reducing to a fine sticky lacing . with a sniff you seem to get a sweet fruit aroma with hints of cherry . taste is where this beer lost it for me . though smooth , it lacked any of the tastes that i smelt . it seemed to taste of light malt and was actually reminiscent of a pale lager . not at all what i expected compared to it 's german counterparts but of course we must remember this is an american take on that old style . light bodied and semi-dry despite it 's smell , taste of alcohol as it warms in your mouth . i suppose this is not a bad summer sipper and so for drinkability i will give it some props , however overall i was personally disappointed ."

S"i bought this beer as a single from the local liquor store $ 1.50 . i am a porter/stout/ris fan , but figure i 'd give this a shot anyway . a : very pretty , golden hay-like appearance , and excellent clarity . white pillowy head that dissipates quickly to a thin film . a steady stream of bubbles from carbonation keeping the film there , absolutely no lacing . s : kind of skunky at first , may have been a bit out dated . there was a presence that was slightly flowery ( under the skunk ) - seemingly more mellow than heineken . t : slight bitter from the hops , probably more effect from the carbonation ( which was just right ) . slight watery taste , but not enough to distract from the hops . pretty smooth overall , practically no after taste . m/d : mouthfeel was thin to moderately thin . carbonation was n't overwhelming at all . given the right summer day , i could drink this all day . summary : for the price , i believe that this is a better beer for the buck than most others of the same style , could have done without the green bottle though ."

S'the head i fouind boring , lacking of a character of its own . only when it fades into a thin collar does it get any interesting to look at . the body is active and has an orange amber color . the smell is quite enjoyable , very fruity , and especially peachy with notes of apple too . also a bit yeasty , with notes of cake . the taste shows strong alcohol notes , but overall interestingly mixed with fruity notes of peach and pear and malty notes of syrupy caramel . the finish in particular is nicely caramelized . the mouthfeel is sweet , a but gluey , and not as dry as one could fear given the abv . almost round . interesting . a real potent brew .'

S"newly available in a can , may be an experiment to see how it holds up ... i 'll attempt to not be biased as this one is one of my old favorites . it pours a clear amber with a large rocky head that leaves good lace . the nose was pretty mild for the most part . the obvious was the toasted biscuity malt with a bit of grapefruit . dare i say ... musty cardboard kinda held in my mind as well . does n't really spark it up . taste was pretty mild as well , but very easy and enjoyable . predominantly toasty , the hops were sneaky but evident more towards the finish . become more buttery as it warmed . clean tastey finish . body is quite light but carbonation is spot on . what lacks in complexity compensates in quaffability ... . which is where i think fat tire shines , and is my best guess for its massive popularity amongst even novice beer drinkers . it is incredibly easy to put down and it is certainly sessionable . it may not be as great as i thought it was years ago , but its still good and it helped bring me into the better beer world and i will drink the piss out of it at any chance ."

S"i had to drink this at a charity event and next time i am going to drink wine . i do n't even know if i can consider this beer anymore . the flavor is so light it is nearly flavorless . it is almost as if they took all the alcohol out of the grains added that back to the beer and a hint of flavor to try and mast the inproportional amount of grain taste . head is almost soda pop like . the color is straw and makes me wonder if they added color back from the barley . because if you tryed to make this beer on your own , i do n't know if it would have much color . what 's the point ? spend the extra money and get some flavor and nutrition out of it ."

S"thin head with good retention , mixture of bubble sizes knit together well , dark cream white in color , moderate lacing . dark brown to red in color , perfect clarity , richness of hue keeps it sitting impressively in the glass . thickly constructed nose of toffee , caramel , brown sugar , raisin , date , plum fruit , some doughiness but not a lot of roast or toast , nothing beyond minor presence of hoppy citrus or flowers , malt city . in the mouth it 's full-bodied and heavy , pretty much squats on the palate . this even with credibly strong carbonation . there 's more pine and mixed white citrus here , however , the smart money is still on the toffee , chocolate , caramel and honey flavors . the fruit as in the nose half raisin and date , half plum and cherry . its cloying qualities make it pull up short rather than extend through a longer finish . flavor intensity is a plus , just wears you down some , not sure i could finish two bottles in a row without feeling bloated ."

S"11.2oz bottle poured into a snifter at around 50 degrees . more head than i expected out of a barrel aged high abv beer . about 2 finger widths of creamy/frothy tan head . the body of the beer is midnight black . good frothy lacing left patterns of bubbles on the sides of the glass . thin rim of head stuck around for the entire experience . awe inspiring . smells like peat moss , with some burnt wood , vanilla , and rubbing alcohol . stings a little . faint caramel and butterscotch , smoke . taste is better than i expected . i 've gotten a little tired of these crazy barrel aged beers where most of the beer 's flavor is completely gone , but this one delivers . there 's lots of whiskey notes in the foreground . strong caramel , vanilla , peat moss , burnt wood , cherries , and some alcohol attempt to mask a beautiful chocolatey imperial stout backbone that comes through at the end . a buttery rum flavor dominated the mid-range . it 's also a little bit dry in the finish , hinting at some roasty coffee bits that play nicely with the strong alcoholic cherry flavor . bonus points for the incredible depth achieved in the flavor profile . viscous , oily , smooth and a little spriteful make the feel solid all around . barrel aging usually does wonders for the depth of feel too so this is no surprise . more approachable than i expected based on the nose-sting and alcohol smell/taste that is apparent from start to finish . everytime i finish a sip though , i feel sustained for a while , licking the roof of my mouth and still getting all sorts of amazing peat moss after-taste . i 'd suggest sipping this beer over the course of at least an hour , enjoying the depth as you go along , almost how you 'd enjoy whiskey . overall if you think of this beer as not just a beer , but a whiskey hybrid , it 's extremely well done and the beer is not completely lost in the shuffle . at $ 9.99 for a 12oz bottle i would recommend it for a special treat if you like whiskey . sure , it 's a steep price to pay but it will probably also be the most interesting beer you 've had to date , it was for me ."

S"poured from a bottle into a tulip . got this from leschkie , always a pleasure . a - hazy bubbley orange with a fizzy white head that disappears rather quickly . hmmm , not sure how much this feels like a quad . i 'd judge this on just a belgian strong ale or something if it did n't tell me a quad right on the bottle . s - smells like a spiced belgian with the fruit of the pomegranate mixing in with the oak of the barrels . little alcohol in the nose . some sweetness as well which is probably the wine barrels . missing plenty of quad notes , but an interesting aroma . t - taste has its good points . i like the fruitiness and sweetness of this taste , with the oak adding some vanilla notes in the back . however , there is not much of a malt backbone , and leaves the taste a little thin . it 's also a little disjointed , not a great transition of the taste from front to back . also , tastes a little medicinal from the alcohol . m - the sweetness and alcohol burn makes this beer little heavier and different than i would want a quad to be . not much malt mouthfeel to speak of to add some heartiness . the barrel aging adds some of the warmth to the mouthfeel that i enjoyed , just the sweetness distracted a little . o - i 'll do the overall assuming i was n't told this was a quad , because they should have never put that on the bottle . i think this is a belgian strong ale . if you look at it that way , it 's got some spice , some warmth from the barrel , and some sweetness from the wine and fruit . could have used some more flavor as they seemed to throw alot into here and did n't get the full flavor out of any of them really . not the best , but not the worst ."

S"had this on-tap at black lotus last night . beer poured a deep opaque amber-brown color . there was a small off-white head that did n't last real long . lacing was strong . it is n't very often that i am impressed more with the aroma of a beer than it 's flavor . this is one of those cases . this beer had a nice scent with strong citrus notes . some bannana was also noticeable . as far as flavor goes this was a pretty run-of-the-mill pale ale . bitter hops were prevelant and left a lingering aftertaste . i did n't notice any malt flavor to speak of . after swallowing the beer there was a bit of carbonation induced tingling on my tongue . mouthfeel is really what ruins this beer for me . compared to most apas or ipas i 've had this one felt light and watery ; it left a lot to be desired . this beer also went down very easily , possibly due to the light mouthfeel . this gives it a high drinkability factor . overall not a bad beer but nothing to go out of your way to try ."

S"it 's amazing how an aluminum can will change the complexity of a beer compared to it 's bottle counterpart . the can version looks about the same , but the smell is almost gone ( replaced by metal ) , the taste is seltzer with a dash of hops and the mouthfeel is , again , seltzer water . there is honestly nothing to it . even the aftertaste has disappeared . the drinkability , however , is actually better since there is nothing to get in the way of finishing the whole can before realizing it . but hey , if you 're drinking one of the american 'big three ' ( ab/miller/coors ) out of a can in the first place , was anything supposed to be different ?"

S"i should preface this review with the disclaimer that this is my first review of a beer and this beer retains an admittedly undeserved place in my pantheon of beers . that being done . i will claim that this beer excels at what it attempts . this beer is a mass produced beer intended to invoke the common perception of beers . that is to say , it relies on the societal conception of beer to derive its value . nothing particular about this beer invokes praise or devotion . for color , it is what i always imagined washed-out gold to look like . the head quickly dissipated but it has continued effervescing . the taste is generically satisfying , but otherwise unremarkable . nothing but the aftertaste alerts the drinker that this is actually a beer . according to it traits , this beer is barely medicore . however , as previously mentioned this beer holds a special position in my beer selection . the reason for this is probably entirely intentional on coors ' part . it is entirely a reproduction of my first taste of beer . the first sip of this beer always summons the recollection of my first taste of beer . the soft introduction with the slightly bitter aftertaste is reminescent of mostly fond memories . as a beer intending not to impress me , but only to remind me , this beer excels . this beer invokes images of my past and i am reticent to reject those memories . therefore when asked what generic american beer i would prefer , i will always choose coors . perhaps not because of its inherent qualities but because of its ability to connect with long cherished memories ."

S"bottled on 6 . october 2010 , into baby chimay ( 180ml ) chalice . pours murky , deep coppery to bronze body topped by light tan , frothy head that slowly recedes . the deep nature of color probably results from usage of additional chocolate and/or black malts . the nose is loaded with rich malty sweetness with toasty notes , tons of fruity esters of plum , prune , raisins and figs , slightly spicy from usage of noble hops with citrus rind notes , brandy like alcohol . the assertive hoppy bitterness is counterbalanced by rich malty flavor with toasty notes ; dark fruits are lesser than in the aroma ; peppery noble hops flavor with strong citrus rind notes and intense bitter finish that lingers for ages . the brewer claims caramel malts containing complex sugars have been used in this one and that 's reflected in rich malt flavor and fullness of the body with less attenuation . creamy and velvety smooth , verging on being syrupy with soft carbonation . the lagering of this basically an ale has nicely smoothened the beer without taking away any of its complexity . in short : a complex , fruity , bitter yet malty lagered ale ."

S"pours a very effervescent gold . lots of carbonation for the kiddies . not much head to speak of . smells kinda bland . some grains coming through . i 'm getting some of the agave adding a strange , but welcome dimension . the taste is pretty nice . there 's a solid grain flavor coming through , the poppy seed is more evident in the flavor than it was in the nose . agave kinda rounds it out . all of the flavors are pretty subtle though . nothing out of control . super smooth as always . this is super drinkable and refreshing . not the most exciting beer on the planet , but pretty decent nonetheless ."

S'the interesting thing about this brew is the fact that its not interesting , yet its not even close to undrinkable ... nice two finger head with great lacing all the way down the glass , smells of faint butterscotch and chocolate ... very faint i will add.. tastes balanced between nothing and nothing , again very faint hints of bready malt and earthy chocolate ... faint is the keyword for this brew ... really the only predominant flavor was , well , alcohol . all in all this brew is definately drinkable , yet painfully average for a winter warmer ... cheers ! ! !'

S"this is my first beer advocate review . this beer was being sold for 3.99 / six at the orange street food farm in missoula , mt . the price was hard to beat , so i bought it . this beer turned out to be a no-frills pale ale . it definitely did n't overwhelm my taste buds . the cost of this average beer is really what made it great for me ."

S"i am a big nbb fan , and tried to get their saison , but wound up with this instead . appearance : poured to clear copper with an amber hue closely resembling ice tea . sported a bubbly 1 finger head with medium carbonation which slowly dimished until midway leaving plenty of lacing . i can see now why the brew falls in the esb category , as this beer looks no way like a traditional `` winter warmer '' . in fact i wish nbb offered this year round as an esb instead of a winter special . smell : piney wood smell up front on the nose with major biscuity malt and minor spice undertones taste : needed several sips and some warming in order to decypher all the flavors going on . here goes nothing : pine trees on the tip of the tounge spread back as the biscuity malts begin to bake midway still intertwined with the woodsy hops . now , the malts fade away to give way to a bitter finish and a pomagranate/grapefruit like finish . seconds later a smack of the palate reveals toasted biscuit malts , wow , this grew on me ! complex and different approach from this brewer creates an interesting and `` different '' but still well balanced esb while not detering too much from the style . it must be a love/hate with this one . mouthfeel : oily and medium thickness typical of an esb , but nothing too special going on aside from the crisp , dry finish . drinkability : smooth but not the easiest to drink . if one is going for the winter warmer effect i can see a slow session at % 6.6 a possibility . otherwise i could proabably only finish 1 in a night . cheers !"

S"ichabod pours a cloudy , very light golden color , with no head ( ha fucking ha ) . the label says , `` we take the soul of a michigan fall and blend it into a beer ; '' if that 's the case , then diacetyl must be a strong michigan tradition , because ichabod tastes like buttered popcorn kernels . there 's also a little bit of hop bitterness , and it finishes with some toastiness . it does n't taste bad -- i actually like it -- just a little odd . up there in the buttery beer hall of fame with harbor city main street brown . despite actually liking the flavor , one is easily enough for me ."

S'clear , reddish brown body , and a small head , made this beer look stately , but boring . the smell was little too fruity for my liking . apart from unidentifiable dark skinned dry fruits , this one also smelled woody and sour . the taste was pretty much same as the smell . the mix of sweet , sour , and musty flavors didnt quite rise to undrinkable standards , but did make me wince every time i took a sip . the body seemed thin at first , but after while it got to be more substantial . usually that is good , but with this moonraker , more flavors were not necessarily better . about the only positive was the well hidden 7.5 % abv . not a beer , id care to drink again .'

S'poured into a lager glass..this beer sells for $ 8.50/six ... surprisingly cheap for an import . very pale , slightly hazy amber yellow . lots of fine carbonation bubbles produced a foamy white head that takes a long time to settle . poor to average lacing . aroma was mostly of harsh cooked cabbage & veggies . sweet malt at first , but then i found it to have a harsh taste of turnips , bitter and not pleasant at all . given the amount of intial carbonation it had a smooth , slightly creamy mouthfeel . harsh aftertaste that clings to the tongue . thank crikey it was cheap ... certainly prefer old mil . to this swill .'

S'12oz . poured amber with a fluffy off-white head that held good retention and left a slow , sticky lace on the side of the glass . aromas and tastes were of sweet malts , bread crust , and toasted grains with a hint of caramel - little to no hops seem to be present . mouth-feel is thin , and i expected it to be fuller after seeing the pour . finishes sweet with hints of brown sugar - definitely lacks complexity . i guess , not a terribly bad representation of the style , but there are many better than this out there .'

S'although not a real connoisseurs brew , taking it for what it is ( a low cal mac ) , the usually bland and watery ultra may have something here . this brew is one of the best thirst quenchers i have drank to date . after a 12 hour day in 90+ degrees and 90 % humidity this brew really hits the spot as a starter . i nominate it for the ultimate of lawnmower beers . the semi-sour taste of lime and the tanginess of cactus seems to go well with the high carbonation . the flavor remains semi-sour throughout with a dry tangy finish . again , not a sessioner for the die-hard , but if you are looking to quench a thirst and enjoy something brewed , this is the ticket .'

S"an unappealing milky brown color quickly gives way to a brilliant copper hue that is topped off with a finger 's worth of light beige foam that endures long but laces little . smell is terribly weak with mere hints of crisp grains and creamy sweetness . this is a cream ale to be sure with a taste and texture that invokes dairy as much as it invokes beer . grains and a bit of malty sweetness combine for a taste that is unsophisticated but , probably for the best , is largely overshadowed by the striking creaminess . its smoothness is its greatest virtue , but i would happily trade it for some character ."

S'on tap at the capitol ale house in richmond , va . served in a tulip glass . a : dark , dark brown with a leathery two finger head . s : dark roasted malts , molasses , maple syrup , wood . t : tastes about the same as it smells , i was quite thankful that this beer avoided the major pitfall of most american barlewines : over-hopping . this seemed to ally itslef more with the british camp : a nice strong malt backbone with sweet and rich malt character . the molasses and maple syrup started it off , and there was a pleasant mid-palate smokiness followed by very late-palate chocolate character and a dry , bitter finish . m : thick , heavy , and chewy . i meal in itself . d : as tasty as this one is , it became apparent towards the end fo the glass that it drinks just like any other barleywine . solid . so go get one .'

S"i believe this is the first and only polish brew i have had . i could never pronounce the name correctly until i actually asked a polish couple . ( for those who are unsure it is zi-vee-ic ) . unfortunately it was n't too impressive . probably considered the budweiser of poland . i had it well chilled in a pint glass . poured a bright yellow color with a decent white head . smell was faint with some grassy hops and mild malt sweetness . taste was thin with a little balance of malt and hops . it is pretty easy drinking but that is all it has for itself ."

S"pours a deep dark brown with a thick tan head that stays around . with the first sip i taste heavy cocoa mixed in with some bitterness and stale coffee . i really do n't taste any chocolate at all , but loads of cocoa . and like most things `` organic '' this is not very good , not at all . others might like it , i dont . i dont know if i want to choke it down and hope i end up liking it , or pouring it down the drain ."

S"poured from a bottle-conditioned 12-oz . bottle . the pour was a deep orange , with a nice thick white head forming at the end . my pour may have been a bit too much , as i was left with large yeast particles floating all throughout the beer . i hope this does n't influence things too much . i might be losing my mind , but i swear i smell a strong chocolate aroma that matches the ripened fruit smells . this is smelling far sweeter than i anticipated . alcohol also stings the nostrils . this could be an adventure . in my mind , the mouthfeel is this beer 's strongest attribute . it feels slick and smooth , and has a considerable heft . it has little carbonation . the taste is a bit of a mixed bag . i am going to reserve final judgment until i have had a chance to taste this on tap as well , but i was underwhelmed by it out of the bottle . for a dipa , there is very little hop presence . the malts and alcohol burn play the biggest role on the trip through my mouth and belly . the sweetness also seems to be coming from ultra-ripened fruits like banana and grapefruit , and of all things , chocolate . that 's not to say this beer is without merit . it is certainly more balanced than other dipa 's ... whether or not this is a good thing , that is for the taster to decide . overall , i found this beer to be a bit messy . i did n't really find the contradicting sweet , bitter , and spice to be working together that well . despite that , it does carry some interesting flavors , so i would be willing to try it again ; just do n't expect something along the lines of the other american dipa 's . also , this is thoroughly a sipper due to the sweetness and high abv at 10 % . get a single if you can before dropping $ 10+ on a six pack . interesting effort by stoudt 's , but it did n't quite do it for me this go-around ."

S"purchased single bottle from martignetti's appearance = decent looking foggy , murky dark orange-brown-peach colord . not much head at all . pretty good lacing . smell = lots of alcohol and zest . a candy like sweetness , smell almost exaclty like strawberry twizzlers . intesesting scent . taste = too sweet and syrupy with the alcohol packing quite a punch to boot . an overwhelming taste that does n't agree with me , just a bit too harsh and sweet . it could be balanced better . more bitter and more of a hops presence . i like the thick , syrupy mouthfeel as it 's quite comforting but the taste gets old fast and just is n't complex . this could really be improved . overall = i do n't have much experience with barley wines . this one is n't recommended and i 'd never try it again as it 's too overwhelming and there 's many other extreme beers i 'd chose over this ."

S"appearance : pours a dark coppery amber with a nice white head about a quarter inch thick . the head leaves a solid lace on the glass . smell : citrusy hops , wet grass , and a little caramel and biscuit dominate the aroma profile of this beer . taste : initially citrus hops hit up front giving flavors of grapefruit and other juicy fruits . this is followed by a nice malt character . bread , biscuit and grains keep this beer in line . following the malt there is a final weak grassy hop and slight bitterness finish the beer . personally i would have liked to see a lil more kick in the end for this brew . mouthfeel : this beer is supersmooth and almost creamy.. the hops smack the pallate , but the malt helps back it up and truly keep it well balanced . drinkability : they do n't go down much easier than this . the hops do n't overwhelm the beer so it makes it that much easier to go down . overall a nice offering from this company.. one of the better beers they produce imho ..."

S"on tap at the mellow mushroom on north davidson street in charlotte . & lt ; beavis & gt ; sexual chocolate came to me in an 8.5oz glass , which totally sucked , but i guess i 'll take what i get . the head was a thick , dirty brown , about a half-inch deep ( snicker ) , while the beer was oily , inky and nearly black . the head receded slowly ( lol ) , but still left a lot of sticky ( huh huh , `` sticky '' ) lacing on the sides of the glass . & lt ; /beavis & gt ; smelled fantastic . chocolate malt and fresh cocoa were the dominating ( laugh if you must ) aromas , but there was a large amount of alcohol and coffee shining through also . some hops that smelt suspiciously like cascade were present in a supporting role . overall the smell was rich , chocolately , and sweet . practically begged to be drunk . a drink confirmed that this was indeed a chocolate beverage fit for the great cornholio himself ! ultra-rich chocolate notes explode on the palate ... like a chocolate infused russian stout , but so much more . roasted grains and hop bitterness swirl amongst the heavy cocoa flavors . it 's bittersweet but sweeter than most imperial beverages . the mouthfeel is sublime - it 's chewy , slick and substantial , while warming the mouth and finishing delightfully bitter from the hops and roasted malt . this may have more chocolate flavor than rogue 's chocolate stout ... a side by side comparison is required ! an amazing drink . while sexual chocolate is perhaps a bit too sweet and rich to drink several glasses of , i sure would n't mind trying . as an added bonus , you should not have difficulty finding a woman who likes this beer . sexist ? the truth , more like ! foothills has crafted yet another superb beer . here 's hoping it becomes part of their regular lineup ."

S"i 'll certainly try to find this beer on tap , but i 'm not getting burned on another bottle . reports at my friendly local beer store put these bottles at 50 % chance of carbonation , in their experience , and my bottle is from the unfortunate half . i 'd curse tomme arthur , but it 's actually not that bad , which is quite the credit to his abilities . i imagine this is a fairly fantastic beer when properly carbed , but , obviously , it 's hard to recommend buying a bottle and i believe in reviewing the beer in front of you . on to the action ... the beer pours a dark , hazy amber , rather orange in the light . a few bubbles sit atop the liquid . they look lonely and sad , weighed down by lost potential and squandered opportunities . the aroma is thick with hops , an intense burst of wildflowers and grapefruit rind . there 's a backbone of caramel malt , perhaps a bit more than i remember from previous versions of the anniversary ale . the flavor starts almost oversweet with sugary malt but is quickly reigned in by brashly bitter hop notes . the mouthfeel ? well , sir , the mouthfeel is poor . and clearly unintentional . this beer has all the feel of a sample pulled directly from the fermenter , rather than a beer that lost carbonation from a bad cap or something . it 's unfortunate because i could see raising scores across the board with good carbonation . i 'm a big fan of port/tla , but they need to sit down and figure out their bottle-conditioning issues before bottling any more beer ."

S'pellucid tawny copper hue . lofty , dense ivory white head leaves frothy , loose lace . underripe apricot and dark toffee dominates the aroma . secondary are herbal , slightly grassy hop tones along with mellow vanilla bean . well rounded and appetizing aromawise . in flavor , incipient is a brief savory biscuit note which yields to sapid fruitiness of a fig like nature . tuneful buttery oak tones arise mid palate and complement the static medium lovibond caramel malt presence . understated woody , slightly earthy hop flavor with a sweet tangerine twang . a touch over attenuated to support the malt profile . only lightly viscous in mouthfeel , but this facilitates formidable drinkabilty . hop bitterness is fleeting , and is eventually supplanted by lightly sugary , dried date like tones late . finishes clean and soft , with mild cookie dough notes fading and yielding to mellow ethanol warmth . a fine , immaculately crafted , albeit simple old ale . subtle , gentle on the palate and superb in drinkability . nary a trace of alcohol harshness . would be interesting to cellar to see what ( if any ) nuances augment . 2003 release .'

S"cherry toned mahogany body . zilch for head . nothing . same with lace . nothing . not to great to look at . but wow , this smells really good . really strong sweet aroma , though not indicative of cloying properties . more candied and a definite `` cream ale '' feel to the nose ... just stronger than any cream ale aroma i 've whiffed before . the flavor follows suit . it is pretty darn sweet , but not cloying . and it does have some cherry like candied notes to it . reminiscent of anderson valley winter solstice if i remember correctly , and i usually do . solid flavor . but that 's where it ends . unfortunately , the mouthfeel is crappy . quite flat and lifeless . this beer is a tale of two cities . rarely do my ratings jump across the board as they do in this one . if this had a better appearance and a lot better mouthfeel , it could challenge lake louie as the best cream ale i 've had ."

S'on-cask at the brewpub , part of the summer solstice celebration series . saison brewed with star anise ( freetail had just ran out of their sarsaparilla version ) . sits in the 3oz tasting glass a hazy , golden-blonde hue with a well-retained cap of bone white head that does a nice job of leaving behind trails of lacing . aroma is heavy on earthy black licorice , masking almost every other smell except for a hint of spiced wheat in the background . the anise flavor fights against a solid saison backbone that provides a bit of tart wheat and spice on the finish . too heavy on the black licorice flavor , unfortunately , because the medium body is nicely carbonated with a crisp , drying finish . points for originality , but this was a big pass for me . had trouble getting down the sample glass , not sure how anyone could have a full pint of this stuff ...'

S"paid $ 7.99 for a 24oz bottle from bobby 's liquor in san jose , ca . poured into a large snifter to review . this is the january 2011 release and i am tasting it fresh ! off white colored head of about a half inch consistent of medium sized carbonation bubbles . rather transparent and light copper in color . good layer of retention and thick lacing . lots of resinous , sticky hops held up by a good amount of maltiness . this is not the typical sierra nevada hop profile i 'm used to . hard for me to pinpoint the hop characteristics , my guess is this is a medley of several varieties . has a very fresh and almost creamy character to the nose . flavor is certainly on the balanced side with some of this high alcohol content showing face . again , like the nose , the hops lack a distinguishable character and in my opinion are balanced too much by the malt . i was hoping for sierra to showcase their fine profile , but i 'm left thinking this is somewhat 'blah . ' medium body and good levels of carbonation , but overall comes off a bit too watery . medium length piney hop finish . while this is n't my favorite offering from sierra , this is very drinkable and going down very quickly . glad i tried it , but would recommend they try a different approach on their next dipa offering ."

S"poured into my stone irs tulip during the afc championship . a deep dark black beer with light seeping through only at the meniscus . came out like a weakly carbonated cola ... immediate two finger fizzy head that dissipated quickly to absolutely nothing . literally , there is n't a single bubble of any kind on the top of my beer ; a swirl lets a few rise , but again , they quickly disappear upon surfacing . sometimes seen in this style , but not what i prefer . a very rich smell that is not nearly as alcoholic as i would have expected ; when i really get my nose down in there and take a huge sniff , i can get the alcohol , but it is impressively masked . i 'm quite impressed with this guy . an intense and rich smelling beer - malty , sweet ... heavy smelling . a definite presence of some fruit ... cherries ? there 's some vanilla in there as well as some chocolate . as it warms up , the alcohol is a bit more present ( it is 18 % remember ) but still not overwhelming the rest of the beer . the taste of this completely surprised me . i 've had numerous 120s from dfh , but this is my first world wide stout . the taste definitely reminds me of the 120 . it is smooth and very creamy with that slick taste you get from the higher abv beers . tastes of sweet ripe fruits , but definitely not the cherries i was smelling . the biting alcohol presence is masked , but it definitely lets you know that it packs a punch . a very sweet taste , start to finish . i really do enjoy this , but still ca n't get over the difference between the smell and taste . ok , as this thing warms up , i 'm retracting my `` lack of cherries '' statement . i 'm getting some dark cherry in there . this is one big bad beer . very low carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel . well masked alcohol makes it more drinkable ... but still , this is n't a beer you put away quickly . i certainly slowed down on this one as the game progressed . even as i sit back between sips , i taste the dried beer on my lips . this beer hangs around for sure ! consumed on 1/24/2010"

S"now budweiser certainly is not something i would ever choose -- unless , of course , the choice was between bud or no beer at all , ( an unfortunate choice to be forced to make , but a very real one for so many of us , none the less ) but it baffles me how almost violently opposed many are to it . i 'm not a lager person and at times find myself speaking disparagingly about anything brewed with the yeast at the bottom but as an example of the style , budweiser is certainly a very decent representation . despite the strong preponderence to serve bud in its classic , signature bottle , just like with every other beer it is best enjoyed in proper glassware , for this an american pint glass . it pours clean and light yellow . when in strong light its opacity is near zero but it has a nice head that lingers for a bit . slight green apple scent with somewhat stronger metallic character . not a lot there . very lightly flavored , a touch of malt joins the classic , but still mild green apple flavor . mouthfeel and drinkability is what this beer is really about . it 's cold , crisp and very carbonated . even if it does n't really taste like you 're drinking a beer , the carbonation is alive in your mouth and livens the experience while still going down very easily . if for some inexplicable reason you are deciding to drink a macro american lager , you ca n't really do much better than budweiser . and , yes , if they had the reach , mgd would try to take over the world cup too - blame fifa , not bud ."

S"pours a golden amber , hazy , with a white ring that last for a while , no lacing visible . smells of lemongrass , and a hint of greens . taste starts out very light with a hint of sweet , but then smacks your tongue with limes and pepper . very wild , very funky . a hint of vinegar . this beer definitely has some lambic roots in it . mouthfeel is acidic , stringent , drying and dominating . as sour and puckering as this beer is , one bottle is more than enough for me . definitely an interesting journey into the `` wild '' side of beer fermentation , but i think perhaps a lambic is more my style ."

S'this was everything i expected from previous reviews i read , but was very dissappointed with the head . lacing was great , but when i opened the bottle lost about 1/3 of it from overflow . almost thought i it was champange like . did not realize i was opening an evervesent . lacing was very thick then went away quickly with a froth . very sour lingering aftertaste . not what i expected . quite exhilirating once able to drink.once drunk not evervesent in taste . will purchase again knowing i will lose 1/3 of bottle because of the unusual taste . sour , great lacing , frothy , though ending quickly : quite unique flavoring which i have not found other than flemish beers .'

S"from a 1 pt . 8 oz . sinister looking artillery shell shaped bottle , i can help , but wonder if a-b is trying to send some evil subliminal message , 2006 vintage , aged on cocoa beans ( ? ) , sampled at a cooler cellar temperature in the snifter that came with the gift pack . poured a clear reddish brown with a foamy pale , cream colored head that quickly settled into a thin bubbly lacing , no sticking . aromas of green apples , wax chocolate candy and fusel alcohol . medium carbonation and a softly crisp , dryish , thin , light bodied mouthfeel . o.k. , now i understand the `` aged on cocoa beans '' bit , but it 's again the apple fruitiness that meshes with a bean bitterness , more of a coffee bean bitterness , not a very appealing taste , watery sweet lager malts , towards the end a fusel alcohol flavor emerges , and a dryish , but watery bean and malty finish . i 'm glad this was a christmas gift , since i did n't lay down my own money for it , i do n't feel bad for pouring the rest of bottle down the drain ."

S'this beer has clearly been made as bland as possible for mass distribution . i bought it under the auspice that it was actually a good beer from singapore . upon pouring , it looked almost identical and smelled identical to miller lite . the taste was not there at all , it just ran through my mouth like smooth flavored water . i expected way more , but ended up being overcharged on a macrobrew import'

S'i was slightly disappointed with summer beer , but only because i expect something more robust from harpoon . however , this beer does what they advertise which is give a good thirst quenching refreshment on hot summer days without scaring away people with more ordinary tastes . it is effervescent and mellow in keeping with the current trend . even though it is harpoons most pedestrian beer it is still a quality product with no real flaws . this goes well with chili , cheese , corn on the cob , coleslaw , and chips .'

S"i was not impressed with this beer . i found it to be very thin and mild for a porter . the color was great - very dark - and the head was retained fairly well . smell is something i love in beer - i love to have a very strong whiff of the beer hit me before each sip . i did n't get that here . this beer had a very mild scent , and just did n't entice me . the first sip i had i felt like a heavy wave of coffee hit me . but , with additional sips i found the taste to be thin , and boring . there is a definite coffee/espresso bean influence - it almost seems like you get some of the chalky texture from the beans . i thought this beer had a thin , flat taste and just did n't have the feeling of being immersed in the flavor like other porters . the aftertaste was mild and short-lived . this beer is quite drinkable though . i found it surprising that i felt no alcoholic effect on me despite drinking a whole bottle in one sitting ( in a little over an hour ) . it went down smooth and was very drinkable . if my bottle was colder , and the day was hotter this brew may have been a very satisfying . i ca n't see this beer having enough character to complement any food . i would not recommend this beer unless someone is looking for a casual drink with a mild coffee flare ."

S"12 oz bottle from a trade with kstrickler into a duvel tulip . a : pours a beautiful , clear copper body underneath an inch of creamy white head . strong retention and tons of fine , spidery lace . perfectly gorgeous dipa s : nice hop-forward aroma that showcases pine , along with some tropical fruit , caramel malts , and some alcohol . very smooth and creamy aroma , but it 's pretty clear that the hops have faded significantly in the months since this was bottled . still , pretty nice . t : lots of pine , some grapefruit and mango , and mildly sweet malts toward the end . it 's truly delicious up to the finish , but here a massive wave of overwhelming booze . it 's really quite a disappointing end to a stunningly tasty beer . m : smooth medium body with light , swelling carbonation that ends things beautifully . very nice . d : i guess it 's hard to complain too much about a 10.4 % beer being hot , but this one is far , far harder to drink than the similarly strong hopslam . notes : i ca n't get enough of how good this beer is at first , but the aftertaste is just off-putting enough to keep this from being one of my favorite dipas . thanks to kstrickler for giving me the chance to try it . i 'll have to seek out a fresh one the next time it 's released to see whether more dominant hops will outweigh the booze . here 's hoping . cheers !"

S"i 've had the ba boris several times , but have never taken any notes . cracked one open at brodie 's house-cooling party so i figured i 'd toss up a review . poured into one of his pint glasses , the thick , black stout stacks up leaving a very dark brown head . the head looks extremely thick and sticks around for quite some time . virtually none is left on the sides of my glass as i drink this one , but i got ta blame that on the glassware , i guess . all of the others that i have had have left large amounts of sticky lace throughout the drink . strong smells of vanilla-bourbon and chocolate . i really enjoy this beer , and the smell is a big factor . the barrels have really helped the b.o.r.i.s by giving them that sweet , vanilla smell . a bit of a detractor is the hot alcohol that comes with a deep breath , but this is minor in comparison to the big picture . the taste is exactly what one would predict given the smell . smooth . damn smooth . reminds me of kate the great in this respect ... almost a velvety smoothness - and very creamy . dark roasted malts give the roastiness to the brew , but there 's a lot of other stuff going on in there as well . the sweet vanilla and caramel provide a great balance to a roasty coffee . the sweet is the initial flavor , before transitioning to this chocolate espresso . a deep , dark cherry rounds this thing off , before the bourbon finish kicks it out the door . very impressive . still a bit hot . the flavor is excellent , but this will score a little bit lower on drinkability . do n't get me wrong , the vanilla-bourbon flavors from the barrel are what separate this beer to a great brew , but i find a bit more heat than i 'd like . being fairly available now-a-days , this is a beer that i keep downstairs and can go to when i 'm running low on new stouts . definitely a keeper . consumed : 4/17/2010"

S"on tap 4/24 @ ginger man austin classic ipa pour-tight , soapy , bready head with copper clear body smells like a sweet grapefruit out of the tap . mellows with warmth . almost perfect for an apa but needs a supporting cast . grapefruit is all over the place in this one . it 's great but that 's about all i 'm getting-it 's sheerly dominant . malt profile emerges with warmth . iso more soapy , floral hop bitterness . some slate comes about with warmth , as does some earthy , grassy but slightly floral hops . very good . cleaner than normal-grapefruit pith aftertaste with malty earth tones . a little disjointed but interesting . this has a lot of elements that work well individually but whole is not greater than sum of parts . this leaves me enjoying the effort but a little confused . still , in bill parcells terms , `` ya shopped for the groceries . now cook the dinner .

S'appearance : medium brown with just a slight haze to it . thin white head tops it off ( good retention ) with little to no lacing . smell : scary , before i even inhaled , i detected hops ! floral/herbal hops almost scorch the nose . hints of citrus reside beneath . taste/mouthfeel : wow ! this one gets the taste buds a tingling . my mouth is buzzing after one sip ( so is my head due to the alcohol content ) . bitter hops rip through the back of the mouth , leaving a faint malt sweetness in their wake . my tongue hurts after one sip , but in a good way . grapefruit grudgingly emerges after a couple of sips , but hops still rule the day . some intriguing stuff , but more than one would do me in .'

S'got this with some other beers to offset my hop-cravings here in germany . straw colored and clear . smelled ever so lightly of pine . a light citrus hop up front , quickly finishing into nothingness . kind of like squeezing a lime into corona ( but with a hop ) . this is the lawnmower beers of pale ales . not distinctive in anyway . you could drink a number of them in a night , but none of them would be memorable ...'

S"i was really disapointed when i realized that max lager 's was only bringing max pale ( an only ok apa ) and a lager to the classic city brew fest . i should have known better . quite frankly , this is probably the best pale lager i 've ever had . the malt is strong enough to taste ( tiniest hints of caramel ) but not heavy . there is very low hop bitterness , but as i 've said in other reviews , unless it 's saaz or the other hops common in pilsners , i find strong hopping in a lager off-putting . this is an excellent and well-crafted lager ."

S"just moved from austin to plano and this is the first beer i 'm reviewing in the new digs . got it at mr. g 's , which seems like it will be a place i frequent in my time here . they also had some more bigfoot 2011 hanging out there , score ! tangents aside , i served this in a great divide balloon glass after pouring it from the awesomely gold and brown 22 oz . bottle . great minds drink alike ! the beer has a brown-tinged black body with a thick cappuccino head . is that the beer 's head or is it a mousse ? very thick and very nice . the nose of the beer is initially dominated by fruity dark caramel notes . something like a dopplebock . the roasted notes are a bit hidden , but come forth with time and temperature . my initial thought when opening this and giving it a sniff is that this beer would be quite a bit like black albert . however , it 's not as thick or as bold . good stuff , but not magic . the taste is along similar lines . it 's thinner than i would have expected and more muted on its flavors . the big yeti hop boldness is n't quite there ... but that might be a good thing . distinctly fruity at the start of the sip blending into a smooth coffee bitterness that melts away in my mouth . this beer is a bit thinner than i would have expected and is a bit weak on the individual flavors , but it is crazily drinkable and i 'm really enjoying this . the beer is definitely greater than the sum of its parts ... which is pretty impressive to say about something that merges two styles that i really enjoy . is it black albert ? heck no . would i buy a bottle the next time they release it ? you know i would ."

S"dogfish head fort ( bottled 2006 ) appearance : red hew that pours with a tall white head when poured into the center of the glass with some side of the glass assistance . carbonation is moderate with medium retention . nose : there is a tart fruit aroma up front , definitely raspberries , that follows with alcohol that tingles the nose slightly . but that is it . the alcohol dominates the aroma and there is not much more that can be deciphered . taste : the alcohol hits you up front giving you a stinging sensation on the tongue . this goes away and subdues to a candy type sweetness of fruit almost like a raspberry lollipop that you used to get at the doctors office when you had to get a shot in the arm . i detect no hops for the alcohol covers any hops that they may have put into this ale . finish : this ale finishes with a slight metallic taste and a very hot alcohol sensation on the tongue . overall impression : the alcohol dominates this alealmost to the point of agitation on the tongue . but that does n't mean this is a bad beer . i feel that it will benefit from a year or two of cool aging in my beer cellar . i think when i open this same beer in a year or two the score will be much higher ."

S"on-tap at prime 16 into a weyerbacher tulip . thanks to john for giving me the heads-up ! a : fully hazed orange-yellow body with a finger of dense white foam that slowly settles into a ring and leaves light lacing . nice . s : this ai n't no american blonde ale - bready malt , peppery yeast , and a huge wave of fruity belgian esters - lots of lemon , apple , and grape . so much citrus yeast as to smell a bit sour . there 's even some acidity reminiscent of white whine , almost like the beer has lacto in it . does it ? i do n't think so , but , regardless , it smells divine . t : not quite as crazy as the nose , but that 's not necessarily a bad thing . beautifully melded , traditionally belgian flavors : smoothly sweet , bready malt is central , mixed with light clove , pepper , and plenty of fruity yeast . very dry , slightly bitter finish with just a bit of light alcohol . straightforward and delicious . m : the smooth , medium body simply explodes into a cascade of soft , miniscule bubbliness . very fun , but just a tad over the top . d : a little boozy for being sub-7 % . notes : this was a great brew , and i 'm thankful i got the chance to try it . i definitely liked it way more than either allagash white or tripel , as the malt largely got out of the way to let the rich , spicy , fruity yeast shine . not the best american belgian pale i 've had recently ( that honor goes to nebco 's 668 : the neighbor of the beast ) , but definitely very high on the list . i really wish allagash would simply replace their tripel with this recipe , or at least brew the blonde more regularly . excellent beer . cheers !"

S"22 oz wax-capped bomber bottle shared and poured into a sierra nevada imperial pint . 2009 vintage , 11 % abv , best after 11/1/2010 ( i definitely wanted to try it fresh for a comparison ) . massive thanks to beerwolf77 for sharing this for our shared birthday tastings ! a - a good , tall pour releases a massive four-and-a-half finger head that cascaded amazingly ! great retention to the dark tan head and huge lacing left all over the glass . the beer poured with a little bit of opacity showing its clarity and deep , dark brown color . in the glass however it 's a different story . no highlights , no light shines through . the abyss is a black hole . s - tons of oak on the nose with a great earthy , wood-filled nose . the molasses is delicious-smelling in the background and a bit of the black licorice is in there giving it a crazy flavor to it . tons of roasted malt lingers everywhere with trailing scents of black coffee and unsweetened chocolate . a bit of the bourbon barrel booze comes out too but not a whole lot considering it 's percent . t - lots of roasted malts that blacken out your tongue like a thick ink . a ton of coffee that lingers through the long finish gives it a dry bitterness . the molasses is more robust in the flavor and the licorice stays at that hint-level ; not too present . a lot of the oak woodiness with nutty flavors comes through too . the oak bourbon barrel flavor with the alcohol is mild for how strong the beer is . its a brooding , complex beer with abounding flavor but it definitely would be better with age . m - completely full-bodied and robust with a bold flavor and a smooth , creamy feel . soft and delicious , the finish becomes very dry and bitter from the high level of roasted malts . it 's got a cold black coffee finish . d - lots of oak bourbon barrel and alcohol flavors that slowly become cloying really lower the drinkability to me . it 's an absolutely fantastic beer but it 's undoubtedly something to have infrequently and with age as it suggests . i 'm very happy i was able to try it as fresh as i did so i have grounds to compare aged abyss . thanks a million to todd for sharing this black hole of a beer with me !"

S"i 'm aware this bottle probably needs more time to develop but i 'm reviewing it anyway . i figure it will help others decide whether to open a bottle or not . bottle courtesy of danny hipps . from notes 06/03/10 . dense black with some dark brown at the edges much like port/lost abby 's other big stouts . minimal head formation and retention . thin arcs of lace are left as i rotate the glass . smells strongly of molasses with choclate , whiskey , vanilla and very subtle roasted coffee notes . wood and booze are stronger on the flavor than they were on the aroma while the molasses still makes a strong showing . bitter coffee-like flavors are mostly an afterthought and barely detectable with everything else going on . carbonation seems somewhat high for a stout . i seem to have a slightly higher tolerance for alcohol heat in my beer than many but this one is really pushing it and stops just short of being offensive . drinkability obviously takes a hit because of the heat . still pretty tasty but this probably needs another year before it 's really ready ."

S"live review . poured from the 12 oz . bottle that i bought this single for $ 2.99 from save-on tobacco & beverage in mentor , ohio yesterday . as instructed on the case , i kept this refridgerated and i believe that it is this year 's vintage . has 9471 stamped on the bottom of the back label . poured into my dark horse brewing company pint glass . i enjoyed the following from the label : `` a biting , bitter , tongue bruiser of an ale . with a name like hopslam what did you expect ? '' a kind of basic , translucent yellow/light orange body under a one inch meringue like head that clings to the inside of the glass pretty well . 3.5 s grapefruit hops . lots of tart , overripe citrus grapefruit hops . i think that i smell several types of hops on top of it . this is a hop head 's dream of a smell . for that , i will give it props . this is not a style that i typically enjoy . 4.0 t wow..the hops are certainly there but there is also a great lemon/orange sweetness that i did not expect . perhaps this is from the honey that is mentioned on the front label ? this is a really great tasting dipa . distant aftertaste holds onto a lot of the bitter , biting hops as mentioned on the label . i can still taste grapefruit several minutes after my last sip . after thinking about this for about a day , i do not think that the taste can be improved . 5.0 m the biting , tongue bruiser qualities really beef up the feel and there is a distinct syrupy sticky quality as well . 4.0 d not that drinkable for me . the bigness of the beer , the citrusy bite and the abv ( very well hidden by everything else going on by the way ) drive down the drinkability for me . this is a sipper , a special beer to be savored and not drank repeatedly ( at least not by me ! ) . 3.5 notes : i really think that the honey is a masterful choice for the taste of this beer . a great beer and plenty going on to satisfy any `` extreme beer '' fan . bell 's certainly advocates good beer ."

S"sam adam 's winter lager pours clear with a rusty light organe color . the head , thick at first , does not remain for long . lacy residue lingers throughout . the beer was well carbonated -- some may say too much but i personally like quite a bit of carbonation . the first sips tasted of slick malt . a great balance of bitter hops and sugary malt . while not the most complex taste , strong hints of cinnamon , nutmeg , and winter can be tasted from the first sip until the last . this beer can be had any winter night -- great taste and texture . best of all , its low alcohol content makes it a truly great session beer . i highly recommend this beer ."

S"pours a clear sort of orange/amber colour with a small white head that has okay retention but not great & leaves a thick lacing . the colour is nice . it smells kind of watery and much like your typical pale lager with grain & bread featuring . it is quite bland smelling though . the taste consists mainly on bread , corn and a little grain with a tangy , citrus like aftertaste that is followed up by a bitter finish . not to my likely , with the tangy flavour a little off putting & not to my liking . this one is very light on the palate & quite watery overall . it is smooth but other than that it does n't have much going for it . the stange , rather tangy aftertaste ruins this beer completely for me . it tasted & smelt rather bland too . more at : http : //abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"

S"nice copper color with very nice head and lacing for an ipa . aroma is of cascade hops and nothing else that i can discern - but it 's the typical sierra nevada aroma - always good . taste is actually very bitter and a touch oaky . i think that the bitterness of this brew brought it down a few notches . definitely taste the hops . mouthfeel is an explosion of bitterness and hoppiness that lingers long past it should . a bit below average in my view , but you definitely get a carbonation hit that brings out the bitterness nearly immediately . drinkability is a bit below average as well due to the bitterness of this brew . it 's far more bitter than any other sn seasonal i 've tried . definitely will give a pass on this sn brew but still love their other seasonals - will pick up the celebration when that comes out ."

S'a very deep amber brown body with a nice orange hue at the edges . host a fat two finger head of light tan mixed bubbles . leaves creamy lace as it fades . nose has even creamy hops and spicey woodsy zest . citrus feel is softly floral . hops slap the tongue as you take your first sip but lengthen out nicely . hints of dandilion and orange rind are present on the palate . the long bitterfeel is not overly blunt at any point and well balanced by a slight sweet hue on the edges . mouthfeel is almost thick and glazing . drinkability and balance highlights this beers strengths .'

S'poured a bright decidedly amber color with a nice little head holds on for dear life . aroma is full of earthy hops and a hint of herbal hops as well . the aroma makes me think that this ale is brewed with high alpha hops ( galena ? ) as it has a strong earthyness to it . the flavor confirms my suspicions of high alpha hop usage as the bitterness is intense on the initial taste and the same hop flavor lingers all the way to the end . definetly a beer for hopheads though as a semi-hophead i find it a bit one sided in the hops department . i tend to like the hop flavor to be in more of a balance with the hop bitterness . body was a little on the light side while the carbonation gave the bitterness increased harshness . if i had brewed this ale i would consider it a success as it is drinkable but i would reduce some of the hops used for bittering and increase the dextrins to help in head retention .'

S"batch 001 . hazy peach with a large fluffy head that dies down pretty quickly . smell is very strong - floral and herbal characters along with a vinegary smell dominate . there is definitely some sour cherry in there , and a woody smell . taste is more of the same . the taste is a tad muted , but well done . a tiny bit of spicy alcohol shows through but other than that it is well hidden . the sourness is mild in this brew compared to most of the belgian lambics i 've had , but the cherry taste seems to come out more , along with a vinous character . finish is very clean with some lingering oak . mouthfeel is spot on for the style , pretty thin . could use a bit more carbonation . drinks very easily . very interesting brew ."

S"i ca n't believe i have n't reviewed this one yet . well i may as well do that now , since i picked up a new glarus variety pack and this was in it : pours a hazy , sickly yellow color with a 2 finger thick , white colored head that dissipates rather quickly leaving just a small amount of lacing on the glass . the aroma has a nice fruit quality to it , some lemon zest , green apples but also some banana and a bit of spiciness . the aroma leads me to believe that this will be nice , sweet and juicy . yep , my nose did n't lie . the flavors is also comprise of a fruity , juicy quality with some nice spicy background . bananas and spicy clove qualities seem to take front seat here , although there is some lemony character as well as an overall sweet grain flavor . a crisp , refreshing beer . the carbonation really tickles the taste buds . juicy in the mouth and low abv , makes this a great drinkable beer ."

S"live review . poured from a bomber purchased about a year ago into my silver rimmed chimay goblet . a very minimal and brief head over a yellow , light brown body . nice amount of sediment ( yeast ? ) floating about in the second goblet that i poured ( the bottom of the bottle ) . good look and appropriate to the style . 4.0 s minimal smell but there is the sweet malt in the absence of a signficant hop profile with a hint of belgian yeast , grains . 3.5 t happy to say that taste more than makes up for a rather weak smell . big malt levels , little to no perceptible hops and nice belgian yeast tastes . good , solid triple , my favorite style . 4.5 m moderate syrupy consistency , consistent with the style , big abv makes this a big beer as well . 4.0 d fine for a tripel , not a style that lends itself to drinkability . this one is delicious and so i drank both goblets ( the amount of the bomber ) without a lot of difficulty . 3.0 notes : big ups to lagunitas not for making a tripel but for brewing this beer which i find to be quite different from other beers that they brew and delivering a tasty beer in the process . lagunitas has honored the 40th anniversary of `` we 're only in it for the money '' in a dramatic way . this might be my favorite label of any beer ( until the beatles or apple corps . license their album covers for use as a beer label that is ! ) ."

S'this beer is hay colored and very bright . it has a slight citrus note , lemon zesty with a touch of pine . a bit of floral hop character as well . its hoppy for a cream ale but not by any means overly hoppy for the style . nice grainy flavor that finishes with a crisp finish . i have tried several clone recipes and can never quit replicate the hop profile for this beer . the hop bursting and my lack of hopback may have something to do with that . overall this is a very drinkable beer and goes great with a day on the beach near the brew pub .'

S"my first time for a flanders red ale , best before 10/07 , served in a tulip . very dark red color , nice little red-tinged head . smell - wow . like a fine , aged balsamic vinegar . sweet , darkly fruity at first , but with a vinegar bite after smelling it for a while . taste - again , wow . kinda grows on you after a while . it 's both sweet and tart . dried fruit , tannic , maybe a very dry grape juice . mouthfeel is a little too slick for me , and while interesting , this just is n't very drinkable for me - not sure i 'm even going to get through this one . just too much for me right now , i guess ."

S"appearance : dark , raisiny brown hue , under a nice , big , bubbly brown head . aroma : initially yielding nothing , but with time we get all the whiffs of a smoked salmon session , right here in your beer ! ... very clear , clean , but sharp with the smokiness , and noticably subdued beyond that . mouthfeel is big and warm , floods every inch ... portery characteristics are secondary to the smoke involved , and you have to let it reign , it 's the smoke in charge tonight . terrific texture , tasty tang , full body , thick , chewy , delicious , chock full of the requisite coffee/cocoa connotations i would demand out of a decent porter , but they emerge only briefly and are submerged by that smoke ! thanks to xlperro"

S"chilled bottle into a glass . purchased at k & l in redwood city . a : pours a murky dark honey/amber color with suspended sediment . takes several tries to get it all in the glass , as even the gentlest pour yields a huge , fluffy off-white head . retention is terrific , with the cap receding very slowly and leaving thick clumps of lacing down the sides of the glass . a slight point off for being too foamy . s : a citrus aroma , but more of the tangerine / lemon variety instead of grapefruit . some pine in there as well . t : follows the nose nicely , but brings in more malt than i could smell . a light toasted malt and caramel base with lemony biscuit character sets the tone . the taste becomes progressively more citrusy before seeing the addition of a pine note and a slight chalkiness in the finish . m : medium-bodied , and despite ( or perhaps because of ) the huge head , somewhat on the low side of carbonation . not very crisp , and the chalkiness builds up a bit . d : this was purchased more for my own edification . as someone who does n't homebrew , i have no idea what simcoe hops smell and taste like , so i wanted to try . a good way to try it , and a decent beer too , but it 's not something i 'd drink again at $ 5ish per 12oz bottle ."

S"this highly filtered ipa is orange to copper and forms a skim layering of head . grassy , some faint caramel and a sweet but subtle malt presence . grapefruit , hints of apricot . musky middle to finish really detracts from the overall score as it lingers and is a bit rough in the smell and taste . i have to say on the upside i think this brew just needs some tweeking as the hops are delicious and the malt profile seems decent enough there was just a killer musty musk that i cound n't get passed . it was a fresh sample . as much as i like pyramid beer this is not their best effort as the middle of this beer gets muddled . it was n't for me ."

S"i had to finally sit down and go over my notes to review heineken on draft from the heineken brewery on a recent trip through europe . there is surely a slightly yuppified bitter stigma ( from an import standpoint ) about heineken here in the states . i had to at least give it due from a point of reference . first off ... heineken is an incredibly different beer in holland . nice pour from the tap , with a short lived but nice carbonated head . a sweet bitterness with characteristics of light grain bread and airy fruits . i liked the smooth flavor , and light body of the beer . it is truely a nice drinkable lager , great for a mild summer afternoon . it has a nice clean after taste , without that characteristic green bottled paleness we see in the us . overall i have always enjoyed heineken for what is was , a standard european lager from the netherlands , imported for it 's exotic appeal in the us . after touring the brewery and tasting/reviewing several beers from the source , i have a new opinion of a good solid pure lager , with great history and tradition of brewing excellence , but still with a slightly dismal masproduced lackluster quality to it ."

S'bottled in 2007 . appears coal black in the glass with a small head that quickly settles to a thin cap . just a little spotty lacing is left on the glass . the lack of suds is not surpising considering the high abv . spilt a little on my shirt , i think it will be permanetly stained . big bouquet of roasted malt . hints of brown sugar , soy sauce , figs , and last but definately not least , alcohol . no getting around the booze in this stout . there is no denying that there is a lot going on in the flavor , but it is hard to get past the alcohol heat to interpret the subtleties . i do pick up the roasted malt . hints of dark fruit and bitter chocolate . then the alcohol comes in and washes everything away with a strong , boozy element . even with a few years on it , the alcohol is quite hot . the body is about as full as a beer can be . thick and chewy with just enough carbonation to keep me from thinking it is flat . works perfectly for a sipper . not really drinkable . a beer that is an event . a beer that a person needs to set a reasonable amount of time to savor and absorb the affects .'

S"this sounded so good after braving the sweltering heat of hephaestus 's forge ( aka , the stone sourfest ) . sadly , this is a piteous , mewling wreck of a beer . pours a very , very pale yellow with a white sudsy foam head . mmm ... ca n't wait to smell that raspberry ... chemical ... stuff , that they shoved into this . no wheat in nose , but tons of awfully fake smelling fruit . flavor is undrinkably bad . this is wretched . sickly , chemically sweet raspberry , what feels like kool aid dumped in here , little to no wheat ( i though there 'd be a pucker ) . what was i thinking . drain pour ."

S"appearance : a slightly hazy , golden-yellow body capped by a finger of whitish head that settles quickly and leaves little lacing . aroma : floral orange peel and coriander over a wheat and pale malt base . reminiscent of a wit crossed with a belgian golden at times . taste : citrus , spice , and some mild apricot notes over a pale and wheaty backbone . it 's balanced well , but perhaps not the most complex brew on the shelves . the aftertaste is grainy , fruity , and lightly peppery . mouthfeel : medium-light bodied with good carbonation and a drying finish . drinkability : immanently drinkable and refreshing , as you 'd hope for from a summer seasonal . verdict : woody creek white is a tasty little brew that works well as flying dog 's summer refesher . a solid-enough american witbier ."

S"this golden beer really is something in-between vienna style and a pilsener . in norway abv is 4,7 % , still it 's an excellent beer . saaz hops and some mnchener malts are used , giving the beer a lovely aroma and a flavour that combines malty richness and crisp freshness . well done , aass ! ( for our american friends : the brewery 's name is pronounced like `` boss '' without the b . )"

S'pours a hazy orange-honey color . nothing purple about it . low off-white sinking head . low aroma of sweet fruit , a little grapey , but no malt or hops . mouthfeel is watery and tingly , too much like soda . flavor is juicy , pretty empty upfront , and all in the finish , where the raspberry finally makes itself known . the raspberry lingers in the aftertaste a bit . flavor also has no malt or hops . this one has no depth , and is out of balance .'

S"served into a royal beer pint glass in a cafe in copenhagen , denmark . reviewed live . cost was 45 kroner ( about 6.92 euro ) . a : pours a three finger head of lovely soft cream , good thickness , and average retention . colour is a caramel copper . semitransparent . generally appealing , but nothing special . sm : cream , sour fruit esters , and bacteria . smells more like a lambic than a lager . very unexpected but welcome . it 's caught my interest now . the strength of the aroma is pretty mild . t : a very creamy open continues through the climax , but is joined there by very light sour ester hops . it 's sort of a kilkenny meets lambic sort of beer , more kilkenny than lambic ( unfortunately ) . i did n't expect this , but i do like it . that said , it 's a bit simplistic : only two notes . the balance is slightly off as a result , and the build is strange but good . i 'd like more complexity and depth . mf : smooth , creamy , and wet . not quite refreshing . it complements the open , but not the climax nor the finish . dr : the price is obscene and the quality is pretty good . it 's very easy to drink , but i would n't get it again because of its simplicity . worth a try at a lower price , anyway . i just do n't know if it 'd be as good if it were n't on draught ."

S"well , this should be fun . poured into a small snifter . thin but formative head , and pretty damned black to say the least . aroma is to me kinda muted and frankly a little disappointing for the style . i 'm just getting a little fruity alcohol ... . i do n't taste a lot of alcohol , though . it 's roasty and quite dry , with bitter cocoa , espresso and hops . it 's kind of unpleasantly bitter , and it hits you like a ton of bricks . it has a really big , thick chewy feel . this will be hard to drink - i think it lacks the typical lost abbey complexity that i was expecting . plus , you feel the big alcohol immediately . definitely not my favorite lost abbey beer ... .afraid i 'm going to have to be on the left side of the bell curve here . wow , you know what , i really do not like this beer ."

S"russian river-looking 375 ml champagne bottle at monk 's . when the waitress opens it up , i 'm half-expecting supplication to come out . what comes out is most definitely not supplication . `` 40-weight '' is a pretty accurate description , it 's thick and black with some brown bubbles that vaguely suggest a head . the aroma is barrel first , beer second -- huge vanilla , bourbon , and molasses dominate , with coffee and dark chocolate in the background . flavor is similar , opening up sweet , with coffee mid-palate fading into a big swell of vanilla , wood , and molasses . alcohol is perceptible , but considering the abv and the style , it 's fairly well-balanced -- but drinkable it ai n't . craft is evident in the fact that this beer does n't taste like the original beer with oak in it the way some other beers do ( i 'm looking at you , oaked arrogant bastard ) , but really does taste like an entirely different beer . some of the malt bitterness and excess sweetness have dropped out and the flavor profile is more complex and much better for it . that said , there are no real surprises in this beer . overall , an excellent barrel-aged stout and a good example of a beer that is elevated ( rather than dominated ) by the barrel ."

S"amber colored with nice head that laces somewhat - pretty good appearance for a pale ale . very appealing . smell is of the british hops , floral and with citrus notes . it has a touch of malt at the bottom of the aroma but overall , a good blend that appeals to me . taste was decent , a bit lighter than i expected , especially with all the aromas coming from it . i 'd have to say that it has touches of malts and a mix of hops that come at the end to clean up your palate , but overall it 's weakened down from the aromas but is still a solid brew , just not above average for taste . mouthfeel was very crisp and clean . hops bitterness just lingered for the right amount of time and then went away . no need to worry about the mouthfeel with this brew . even when it warmed up slightly ( i was drinking it outside in full sun ) , it still had excellent mouthfeel and did n't become too heavy . it is n't light but rather a happy medium . drinkability was outstanding . i was drinking this brew and keeping it in the shade outside on a beautiful day with full sun , while working on removing a bush . i kept looking forward to the beer waiting for me in the shade whenever i 'd take a break for a gulp or two . eventually , i finished it off and was unhappy that i did n't have another one to follow it up with . overall , i 'd say seek out this beer for a change of pace . it is n't for everybody nor would it be approriate for all occasions but if you have something in mind and know what this brew does , then it 's an extremely solid choice , especially at its price point ."

S"the first thing i noticed after pouring this brew is how fast the head dissipated . it started as a strong head but then quickly vanished , only forming a thin layer at the top of the beverage . the remnants laced nicely . it poured a lovely dark amber brown , with hardly a hint of a cloud . very nice appearance . the smell is strong and malty , with hardly a hint of hops . the taste is almost identical , leaving only a small taste of hops as an afterthought . the malty taste is very strong , almost leading to a caramel-like sensation which fills the mouth . the beer feels somewhat thick in the mouth , but is n't syrupy or chewy at all . it went down smooth and did n't irritate the mouth on long tastings . overall , a so-so beer . i probably wo n't be seeking this one out for a repeated tasting with all of the better alternatives , but i surely would n't scoff at being offered this drink in the future ."

S"pours into a pint glass as a hazy auburn with a large bubbly head that leaves just a touch of lace down the glass . smells of smooth , tangy , nutty malts with floral hops . not bad , but maybe a bit muted . taste is initially dominated by floral and citrus hops , then comes some nutty/caramel malts coupled with a mild alcoholic astringency . aftertaste is similar to the aroma , tangy malts as well as a bit of diacetyl and lasting bitterness . seems like an interesting mix between english and american ipa . seems to follow with some other canadian ones that use some citrusy hops as well as lots of malt . smooth , full mouthfeel with enough carbonation to tickle your mouth a bit . drinkability is great ; alcohol is hidden very well . i 'm glad i tried it and i 'd drink this again if offered , but given that it cost $ 6 for a 500ml bottle in gatineau , i 'm not sure i 'll buy it again too soon ."

S'poured a brown color with a hazy , evanescent tone to it especially at the edges - strange . very little carbonation even with a vigorous pour , thus no head or anything else . smelled of true fruit scents of apple and pear , exactly like a duvel . cinammon-tinged caramel scents slowly arose , then malts of both dark and caramel sorts . did come across as musty wood sometimes . in sum , points for being interesting . tasted of fruity flavor of apples , caramel , and an all too mixed blend of malts : dark , roasty , pale but neither one wins out nor do all three blend together well . yeasty with slight green hop flavors and oils at the end of the yeast flavor , then a quite barky finish where i could taste the alcohol a smidge . mouthfeel also can & # 8217 ; t make up its mind between thin or moderate , but not too bad of a range to be waffling in . this beer is all over the place and constantly shifting , thus nowhere ever . with respect to heavyweight who makes the superb lunacy , cinder bock , and perkuno & # 8217 ; s hammer , in my mind this is an experimental beer that fails - oh well , i & # 8217 ; ll just drink everything else that they brew well .'

S"got this on tap over at the sunset grille in allston , ma . the color was a slightly cloudy yellow color , with a thin white head . the smell is mostly of the hops , but they are not overpowering in my mind and there was little else wafting out . the hop smell became more prominent as it warmed up . the taste was somewhat bland . you get the hops , but there 's also an almost fizzy acidy taste with this one . it sharply `` stings '' the palate and is not a smooth and easy one to drink . overall i was not that taken with this offering from the gang at six point . granted this was about my sixth beer in , so maybe my palate was off a bit , but still did n't feel like it jumped out at me . i 've had better from six point , but will probably give this another go , but ca n't see myself ordering this on a regular basis ."

S"22oz bottle poured into a duvel tulip . a - the beer pours a very dark , murky brown , with a bit of light shining through around the edges of the glass . standard pour yields just under 1 finger of foamy , uneven head that quickly dissipates , leaving a small amount of foam ringing the beer . some lacing is present , but not much . s - three words pretty well sum up the aroma : wood and bourbon . there 's a ton of both , and they do n't leave room for anything else . honestly if i were blindfolded and given a glass of this next to a glass of , say , maker 's mark , i doubt i could tell the difference without tasting them . no nuances here - this one is upfront about what you 're getting into . t - the flavor is predominantly - big surprise here - that of bourbon , and the barrels it came from . i ca n't find a lot of info on this beer , so i do n't know how long it spent aging in the barrels , but i 'm fairly confident in guessing 'a bit too long ' is the right answer . that aside , there 's surprisingly little heat - again , i ca n't find info on the abv - but if bourbon county stout were 4-5 % lower in abv , i imagine the two would taste fairly similar in this regard . even after the beer has been in my glass for 15-20 minutes , i 'm still not getting any other flavors . not that i do n't like bourbon or anything , but this is bordering on ridiculous . m - medium-full bodied , each sip somehow seems to get more viscous the longer i wait to swallow it . there 's a bit of creaminess to be found , which is nice . compared to the kick in the face that is the smell and aroma , the mouthfeel has a lot of subtlety . probably my favorite part of this one . d - i wish i were sharing this with a friend or three . despite the lack of alcoholic heat , it 's still not a quaffable brew , and i 'm going to be working on the bottle for a while to come . if i were strictly rating this as a wee heavy i 'd probably have to give it a d. this really is n't a d beer though , and as an after-dinner digestif i think it would be an excellent substitute for brandy or cognac . if you love whiskey and find a bottle of this , it 's definitely worth a try ."

S"first time visiting the suds , and i walked in with an open mind . have not heard much good about this place from the craft beer community , but i wanted to find out first hand . decided to go with the pale first - fairly safe bet , right ? bar keep informed me that it is more like an ipa - `` bitter with lots of hops '' . this is starting to sound good . appearance of the brew was an immediate red flag as she placed it on the bar . my pale ale appeared to be more in the brown ale/porter range based on color . i wondered if she poured the wrong ale . the beer was a deep , dark brown with a very thick head . knew something was off as i brought this to my nose for a smell . i tried to pick out the characteristic floral/citrus hop aromas i was expecting , but they were a bit hard to find through the other distracting smells . had a very strange aroma - some what of a metallic , stale , musky smell . maybe its the 'pure syracuse water ' they use . flavors were not much different . metallic , stale malt , astringent , almost molassesy were all unpleasant flavors that came to mind . very hard to find any positive flavor characteristics in this beer . the mouthfeel was the only good aspect of this beer that i could find . it had a very stable body with a very thick and creamy head . i got about a quarter of this pale ale down and could not get any farther before leaving it on the bar . i did ask a friend to give it a try before i discarded it to make sure it was n't me that was off , and they agreed that it was awful tasting . i wish i could say i had a good experience here so that i could add another great beer destination to the long list that syracuse boasts , but i really can not . i do n't understand how anyone can come here and enjoy the house beer , especially with empire around the corner . i did sample two of their other house beers , and they too were not pleasing ."

S'if you are going to a sporting event and want to drink 30 beers in a sitting , miller lite is for you . i drank tons of miller lite in college , at phillies games , eagles games , pretty much any sporting event . it is also good for beer pong , asshole , etc . basically if you want some serious volume , miller lite is for you . there is a time and place for miller lite , and it can be quite refreshing . however , if you are looking to have a beer or two , get something better . for the record , i do like miller lite and support it . and , it is better than bud light .'

S"big and fat japanese man on the label holding a beer . cool label . pours a dusty deep orangish mahogany . the rocky and frothy head morphs into a huge tsunami wave and rushes to the shore . the lacing is thick and active , bubbling as it sticks . the aroma is excellent . cinnamon , ginger , nutmeg , caramel apples , cherries , light sugar glazed coriander and fresh fruitcake in the nose . quite the sniffer , in fact , this aroma deserves a 5 ! particles everywhere . the tidal waves subdues . orange peel jumps out and hits me first . spices , many spices from the hops and then loads of cinnamon come in . loads of juicy fruits come in on the finish with vanilla and an alcohol kick . finish lingers . however , this beer suffers . overcarbonation plays an enormous role in this beer . the mouthfeel was `` soda like '' and the overcarbonation affected the flavor and the mouthfeel . this still was a delightful experience . smell the empty bottle when you are done . it smells like fresh peaches ."

S"pours an inky black with a slight beige head . a ring of foam encircles the glass as it leaves some spotty traces of lacing . smells wonderfully smoky and like dried wood . there 's roasted aromas here , with some sweet and nutty malt at play in the background and undertones of chocolate . this hits me at first as 100 % pure smoke against a really nice amount of bitterness . as i go on i get hints of chocolate and roasted coffee , maybe a little nuttiness and peatiness . it all works together against a medium bitterness with a lingering dryness in the finish that is reminiscent of beechwood . mouthfeel is smooth , medium -- could use a touch more carbonation . overall a good beer but i 'm not huge on smoky flavors and this one is a little heavy-handed with the smoke , so i do n't think i 'll likely ever drink another ."

S'750ml ceramic bottle , unknown vintage ( possibly a few years old ) , sampled june 2007 pours with a frothy , almost two-finger thick ( when roused vigorously ) , dirty , pale brown colored head . the beer is an almost brilliantly clear , deep red color when held up to the light , otherwise it is an opaque , drab , dark amber color . the aroma smells quite sweet and malt focused , with some aged malt notes as well . notes of sherry and prunes are noticeable around the edges making me guess that this is at least a couple years old . hop aromatics are still noticeable , with notes of muddy herbs , dulled orange zest , tangelo and some sweet lychee aromatics being noticeable . the taste is quite a bit drier than i was expecting and it does not have the rich syrup-like body i was expecting . it does have a gripping bitterness in the finish that is almost harshly astringent . aged malt character definitely shows up here with notes of dusty , toasted grain / chocolate in the finish , and a touch of sherry . in many ways the flavors here just seem washed up , especially considering that i was hoping for gracefully aged . i have had this beer long ago , and have even heard recently how bitter this beer was , but i was still a bit surprised by how tongue scrapingly hoppy the bitterness of this beer is ; even in this obviously aged sample it still dominates the finish with an unwavering grip . with the lightish body , and without the dark color , this would almost pass for a modern day double ipa ; though it might perhaps be a mediocre example . i will have to try a fresh bottle of this soon to see what that is like .'

S"the best i can tell , lost abbey 's big beers are intended to be drank by people as sustenance after an apocalypse 10 years from now . their beers are so huge , you probably do n't need a meal to accompany them . they also clearly can sit down for quite a long time . of course , i am not reviewing a 10 year old , 1500 calorie beer from the perspective of our children 's children , but instead what i had in front of me the other day . nose is booze , brandy , rum raisins and booze . a vigorous pour and heavy swirling summons the tiniest big of head . this is an intimidating beer . giving it a sip , i can immediately tell that the brandy barrel is the right match for this beer . if you do not like boozy beers , just run away as fast as you can , because this is the brandy equivalent of fresh goose island bcbs , but stickier . i actually really enjoy the flavor , though it takes over an hour to get through - a lot for me . flavor is chewy candy raisins , brandy , figs ( or whatever ) - that kind of stuff . really very good stuff . this beer is actually really good - but probably only for people who like big boozy , brandy flavor . funny enough , i had it after it had sat down for a year , so i imagine that it would be unacceptably boozy fresh ."

( i had no lemon or orange slice in my serving ) tastes lemony at first with a citrusy finish , but not much body to it . very good mouthfeel , sweet and smooth with a little more carbonation than i thought it would have . this is a very drinkable beer . it is a better interpretation of the style than hoegaarten . i think the ho ' has gone downhill over the last few years . this one reminds me of allagash wit ."

S'this beer really benefited from a little warming . cold from the fridge the aroma had a distinct metallic twang , which was carried slightly in the first flavor . after letting the chill fade , the metallic note faded and a sweet caramel malt took its place . hops are not all that impressive , a little blunt and not very assertive . really seems more like an esb than a pale ale . a pretty average pale ale , but smooth and easy to drink .'

S"this is an odd one . on the bottle it says `` brewed and bottled for detroit brewing company by detroit rivertown brewing company '' , however , there is no such thing as detroit brewing company..there is only detroit beer company . i think they mislabeled this beer . abv is not listed on the bottle , however i found a resource that states it 's 7.8 % abv http : //www.mlive.com/kalamabrew/index.ssf/2010/11/michigans_detroit_brewing_co_a.html this cost $ 1.80 for a 12oz single @ jacks market . pours out to a clear near black , forming a tall and creamy tan head like espresso crema , with excellent retention and a solid sheet of lace . the aroma is really good ... i pick up black walnut , espresso , dark chocolate , vanilla bean , and dark fruits . the mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy , almost like a nitro tap , with a medium body . the taste is a recap of the aroma . there is a pleasant chalkiness about midway thru , and it 's nicely balanced between the earthy bitterness , the malty sweetness , and the chocolate overtone . it 's not a chocolate bomb like sam adams chocolate bock , but there is enough there to notice . there is a faint suggestion of kiwi fruit acidic tartness that warns of impeding infection as mentioned in the ba forums that some people have tasted . i would n't store this one . this peculiar tartness starts to become more noticeable by the middle of the glass and starts to limit it 's drinkability . a decent beer for the price , although i 'm not confident of it 's ability to last more than a few weeks . one is enough for me ."

S"i 've got well over 30 beers languishing in my notes to review , but for some reason - it could be the torrential rain on a dreary november day - i felt like something woody , something soothing , something ... bourbony ! thanks to my fridge for hanging onto this one for a while . 2009 vintage . a. backwoods bastard is a dirty looking , sediment-heavy , caramel red with just a touch of lacy head that eventually flattens out . looks a bit thin and watery , the yeasty bits remain suspended in the brew . one of the odder looking brews to grace this snifter . s. initial nose is sweet malt and a pronounced woodiness , followed by brown sugar , a bit of char and a good amount of bourbon and alcohol heat . there 's an estery , date-like sweetness that 's often found in barrel aged beers , but it too seems overmuch . as it warms you get more : vanilla , a bit of heather-dirt , more nuanced roasty-sweet malt . not bad . but as a whole the experience is sweet , sharp , and boozy . t. hmm ... what we have here is an over-bourboned , very sweet wee heavy . now , i love bourbon , but it needs to be in harmony to the beer ( see ba sexual chocolate for a world-class example ) or be so insanely tasty that you just do n't care . backwoods bastard is not quite there . there 's a big estery , brown-sugar sweetness , a lot of barrel character , and booze to spare . this is 10 % and shows . the bourbon is the heart and soul of this beer , the scotch ale ( the more interesting flavor to be had ) seems to work around it , filling in the cracks in the woody , sweet , alcoholic and warming base . the sweetness is just shy of being too much , and the finish is sugary , woody and warm with some distracting aspirin-like bitterness . m / d. strangely thin , not quite watery . carbonation is low but adds some needed punch ; i would prefer more . not easy to drink , i 'm sorry to say . the bourbon is too sharp , the sweetness distracting . founder 's own old curmudgeon does this thing better . backwoods bastard is n't exactly a miss , but if i was doing this in a lineup i 'd use it of an example of a bourbon beer that does n't quite hit the mark ."

S"color is a soft , medium brown , almost clear . tall , light tan head , which falls slowly and unevenly , creating an attractive effect . aromas are fairly high-toned and very clean , featuring toast and almonds . medium-heavy body , with moderately low carbonation . sweetness is just hinted at . flavors are a restrained combination of fruit and both roasted and unroasted malt . the malt here is malty , not sweet - nice ! chewing emphasizes the fruit component . finishes long and slightly bitter , just enough to cleanse the palate and beckon another sip . however , there 's also a suggestion of alcoholic heat and heaviness that hampers the drinkability . i love how this beer can manage to be fruity and malty without being sweet ; even more remarkably , it manages this feat without showing any overt hoppiness ! but i 'm dissappointed in the alcohol showing ... after all , the abv is only 6.3 % . i wo n't be keeping this in my rotation due to that flaw ."

S"this is a sentimental beer for me ; i reviewed it before in the bottle and wound up giving it a `` d '' . i felt maybe the beer was cheated , so i tried again on tap ; i had three pints and took extensive notes : pours a medium coppery brown - very clear . dense 1 finger cream colored head , retains a thin crown of foam with light lacing ; laces very well the second time in the same glass . some sweet malt aroma , bread and caramel . a touch of sour fruit on the nose . as it warms it smells more of honey and esters . a touch of herbal hops . taste is of slightly sweet , slightly bready malt , a hint of honey , some caramel and fruity esters . a watery sourness takes over mid-palate . moderate bitterness throughout . good tingle on the tip of the tongue , which fades sharply . finish is a bit dry , minerally ; there is some lingering sour bitterness , and a hint of sweet/bready malts . there is a mild hop flavor . sour-stale flavor becomes prominent about 2/3 of the way through a pint . mouthfeel is good ; a bit too much carbonation , very slight chewiness . overall it 's very drinkable ; i mean , it 's bass on tap , seriously . there is a sometimes overbearing fruitiness from the esters and honey-like malt . there is a definite sour-stale flavor , less than in the bottle . unimpressive , but satisfying and decent ."

S"7oz . bottle poured into a tulip-style glass . it pours a medium gold color with half a finger of head that dies quickly . there 's almost no lacing . the smell is sweet and malty , has a bit of a corn smell to it as well . no real trace of hops . the taste is malty and corny , with a slight burning sensation on the finish . the body is actually fairly thick . the drinkability is ok as well . really needs some work ."

S"the head forms immediately and is huge and fluffy . it then dissappears quickly . the beer is pale straw in color with good clarity . the aroma is pretty much mellow sweet malts , and maybe a touch grainy too . nothing exciting in the flavor department , just some sweet malts and a little bit of hops in the finish . it 's pleasant to drink though and definitely would be a great session beer . the hops in the finish is what hit me as making it highly drinkable . it keeps just interesting enough to be happy ."

S'many thanks to drdogbeer for this thoughtful summertime extra ! 22 bomber into a hefe glass . pours a nice cloudy light golden color with some straw depth and a characteristic softness to it . a nice , though short , white head recedes to a thin wisp of clean patchy bubbles . some decent strings of round lace . the last pour is the best , with great cloudiness and fuller head . nose is subtly phenolic with banana , overridden by outgoing wheat and grainy scents , sweetening a little as it warms . clove spice is notable , but relatively mild , deepened by lemongrass and hay . taste has strong lemony character over the notable wheat in flavor and body . slight fruitiness in the middle with a soft background spice at the finish . love the bready aftertaste feel has good crispness from the carbonation through a medium body with a full clinging finish . very easy to sip , and extremely refreshing on a hot summer day . goes down easy , smooth , and seemingly light , yet very satisfying .'

S"always a joy to pop the top on a new glarus beer . this one poured into the glass a light yellow color , with a thin head . aroma is light and fruity , with some honey notes sneaking in there . perhaps a little banana and bubblegum . for a very laid-back aroma , there 's still plenty going on here . flavor brings in light lemon and other fruity sweetness , a hint of honey , fresh bread , just a small trace of corn ( which was indeed used in this beer ) , a nice hops kiss ... subdued and subtle , but enjoyable nonetheless . mouthfeel is appropriately creamy and stays that way , with an ever so slight stickiness . cream ales are a complete unknown to me . judging from this one i 'd call them extremely drinkable , only mildly exciting but great for the summer , and generally porch-sittin ' mellow . i only have more respect for new glarus thanks to this beer and their totally naked offering , because what they 're doing is neither pandering to extreme gonzo-beer fiends or trying to garner mainstream appeal . they just do it for the love of the craft , and that 's why even their least remarkable beers come out winners ."

S"dark dark dark , no light coming through , coffee and cream colored head that dissipates sooner than i would expect . swirling brings it back , not a lot of lacing . there 's sweet chocolate malt , and coffee nose , hint of bitterness , can smell the alcohol warmth the bitter coffee taste is balanced by a mild sweetness . this gives way to hop bitterness and alcohol . it definitely earns the `` imperial '' title . mouthfeel is thick , but not overly so ; smooth , and creamy . substantial slides down the throat slowly . very pleasant . it 's too heavy to have a lot of , but it tastes so good i could see myself throwing back three or four before realizing what hit me . then i would stand up , and the floor would hit me ."

S'review from a 1 year aged bottle . pours an opaque dark brown with thin tan head and minimal lacing . smell is pretty much like creme brulee - caramelized sugar and vanilla . taste is sickly sweet . smooth mouthfeel . this is the definition of a dessert beer . when i had a bomber of this myself i struggled to get through this because of the sweetness . this bomber was shared among a few people and i even struggled a little bit to get through my glass . it is delicious , but can only be handled in small quantities . i would like to try to use this beer as a topping for ice cream .'

S"been waiting a long time to drink this one . story on label says it was created 11/5/07 and recommended waiting till fall 2009 . poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass . was pitch black in color . visible carb streams on the surface . gave it a good pour and got a pinkie finger sized dark , dark brown head that quickly dissipated into a barely there color ( about what you 'd expect at 17.5 % ) . no lacing . the aroma is still very hot . lots of alcohol up-front but that settled some as it continued to warm up ( or i just got numb to it ) . also had molasses , dark roasted malts and vanilla . the taste is also very hot with the alcohol even more dominant . not too hot at this stage to be undrinkable but i think it still needs some age to it . after the alcohol fades at the end , the base ris flavors comes thru so the after-taste is a little muted . wish more of that flavor was present at this stage . mouthfeel is viscous and burns a bit from the alcohol . hot aftertaste . overall , i wondered what this would taste like in a couple years . for now , it 's still too hot to be very enjoyable after 1/3 of it . if you have one , keep it in the cellar for awhile and let it settle down some . rotation - not avail in tx so got in a trade with johnnnniee - many thanks . this one is enough for me ."

S"this was the very first dogfish head beer i tried when i first began my beer tasting hobby . it took me an hour and a half to finish , as i was not prepared for the huge flavor this beer packs . it turned me away from dogfish head for awhile . that was until someone coaxed me into trying a 90 minute ipa . i loved it and i have tried several other dfh since then but have n't returned to the 120 minute ... until now . as it turns out the problem was my palate because , damn , this is a good beer . poured a 12oz . bottle into a tulip glass . appearance - peach tan with a one finger head that dissipates into a foam halo on the beer 's surface . a quick swirl of the glass brings the head right back . smell - alcohol - and lots of it ! at 21 % abv this is the most potent brew i have ever sampled . it certainly makes an appearance in the smell . i also smell caramel and hops . overall , it smells very rich - a good indication of what it will taste like . the smell becomes a lot more apparent as the brew comes to room temperature . taste - almost like the 90 minute , just heavier on the sweet side and the hops side ( obviously ) . the alcohol is n't as apparent in the flavor as much as it is in the smell and the mouthfeel . the alcohol makes its main appearance in the throat as it goes down . it has the sweet malty front taste followed by hop bitterness . it has a very balanced flavor - something i was surprised by . mouthfeel - smooth . perfect carbonation level . oily with warming alcohol as it slides down the throat . drinkability - i would never be able to drink more than one of these , but if a second was offered to me ... you never know . i would probably be too tipsy to refuse . the fact that you would be plastered after the second is why i gave this brew an average score on drinkability . i was pretty tipsy 3/4 of the way through it . but it went down smoother than a lot of other beers that i have sampled that were less than 21 % abv . this beer is a hell of an experience . perhaps the most accessible high abv brews out there - definitely not for the faint of heart . it still takes me an hour and a half to finish one , but i appreciate every sip ."

S"st : 12oz poured into a chalice . a : black with a very thin raggedy dark brown head ( swirling the beer a few times does bring that beautiful brown head back ) . it leaves nice spotted lacing on the glass . s : chocolate cake or milt ( of course ) , roasted malt , smoke and coffee . t : gentle smoke up front rolls into roasted malt and coffee in the middle . by the end , strong chocolate ( bitter , not sweet ) , alcohol , some roasted coffee bean , and smoke take over the finish and stay there ( a very nice long finish ) . m : heavy , creamy in the middle , though the finish is drier ( the hops balance out the beer ) . d : high abv and heavy body does not make this a beer to be consumed in large amounts . overall : an excellent winter beer . this is not the first time i have had brooklyn 's black chocolate stout , but i never reviewed the beer until now . this stout is heavy , complex , and full of flavor . even better , it is balanced well . i buy this every winter , and it has not disappointed me ( except for when they changed from a six-pack to a four-pack ) ."

S'12oz bottle poured into a shaped pint glass . the 2009 version of sierra nevada anniversary ale poured a deep copper , that had orange tint when held to the light , and a small creamy head that left rings of sticky lace . the color was perfect . the smell was crisp and citric ; however , the taste was bland . the feel was smooth , thick , and bitter -- very well balanced . this was a pleasure to drink on a hot late summer day . sierra nevada is constantly producing creative , well crafted beers ; however , they seem to , recently , be bottling the same ale in different packages . torpedo , southern hemisphere , and now the anniversary ale , each share some wonderful characteristics , along with a near-lack of flavor .'

S"one of my favourite beers during my early twenties i revisited this beer recently and much to my dismay i was quite disappointed . a - a nice straw colour , however seems a bit too light . pours with little head s - an average smell which improves tremendously with the addition of some lemon . nothing to write home about . t - smooth however a rather bland taste . improves significantly with addition of lemon but certainly nothing special . a wheat flavour which is average at best . m - very nice feeling , no aftertaste . d - very easy to drink . perhaps my beer taste has matured but i wo n't be going back to grasshopper anytime soon ."

S"i love the union , jack . and the big brotha is no exception . double jack is one of those beers i try , try and try again to replicate in homebrewing scenarios . it 's an inspiration to west coast brewers looking for significant body and an extraordinary hop presence in an ipa . the senses : the appearance is light copper orange with a decent sized head . i could tell this beer was pretty viscous as the small bubbles of carbonation slowly fizzled from the glass on an epically slow journey towards the head . what a great sign ! the smell is boooold citrus . grapefruit and tangerine dominate , but a slight alcoholic heat is present . flavors are amazing ! this beer is sweet on the lips with citrus flavors and a solid malt backbone . i love what the munich malt adds to the body of this beer . it 's a bitter beer for sure . the tail end of the flavor is a little hot , but surprisingly appreciated.it 's thick mouthfeel is glorious . it 's like sipping on maple syrup , that 's how thick and viscous this beer is . i gave it a good solid `` 4 '' on drinkability because this beer is 9.5 % . if i had more than one bottle to myself , my head would be hurting tomorrow ."

S'deep brown color with mahogany highlights . it was topped with a decent sized tan head . it has a very sweet aroma with caramel toffee and dates . there is just a touch o orange citrus in the nose . the taste has the same sweetness up front toffee/caramel with a chocolaty character delivered by the roast malt . it finishes with the citrus orange delivered by the hops and a mild alcohol warming . the mouth feel is very smooth and rich . the drinakbility is hurt by the intense sweetness , but this is still an good beer .'

S'pours a pale , hazy hay color with a sudsy white head that never really disappears . if i had to judge this one using my nose alone , id guess it were a cider ; the appetizing apple aroma eclipses anything else that might be in there . and , while its certainly there , the apple ( of the granny smith variety ) is far more subdued in the flavor , which also includes acidic citrus , coriander , orange peel , and some grain that pulls it all together . very light mouthfeel with subtle carbonation . i would say that this brew is much closer in character to a witbier than any sort of fruit beer . but what ever it is , its a real treat ; tart and acidic , but still delicate and refreshing . highly recommended .'

S"huge thanks to knifestyles for opening this ( and , later in the night , the 1902 king 's ale ! ) at his recent birthday tasting . can you say epic ? a : the cork has shriveled so much that it 's no longer touching the neck at all , but luckily there 's a solid plug of wax maintaining a seal . once the cork corpse has been safely extricated , the beer pours still , clear , bright , and orange-brown . nice legs . very attractive for an ancient beer . s : interesting . smells more like a dry , nutty sherry than any beer i 've ever had . light acidity , pleasant musty woodiness . clear notes of tobacco + leather are there from the start , and intensify as the beer warms . eventually the tobacco becomes dominant , giving the beer the aroma of a fine cigar - complete with a touch of cedar . hugely complex , old , and luxurious : it smells like a victorian study , replete with cigars , old books , leather chairs , wood paneling , and a crackling fire . enchanting . t : heavy on the must , wood , nuts , sherry , and acidity . the tobacco just does n't come through as much as i 'd like , and thus it does n't taste quite as fascinating as it smells ; still amazing for what it is , though . m : smooth , surprisingly thin , and completely still . i 'm fine with the lack of carbonation on a vintage ale like this , but i expected more body . o : i think my description of the smell says it all : this was a one-of-a-kind , truly memorable beer experience . if you get lucky enough to try this beer , make sure that you keep your glass around for a long time so as to enjoy the evolution of its aroma . insane . cheers !"

S"thanks to sendsilk for this . i have been looking forward to it after experimenting with wood aging in some of my home brews . pours quite cloudy , a tarnishing bronze color . the head is better than the standard jai alai , a light balsa wood color . decent head retention and a smearing of lace . the aroma is n't as oak forward as i imagined . the base beer really holds fast here . lots of the same juicy hops providing pineapple and other tropical notes . there is a faint woody dryness , but nothing overpowering . oak is much more prominent in the flavor of this beer . grainy fresh young timber mingles with the citrus and pine flavors of the hops . there 's still a good malt backbone to this beer as well . dry with lingering bitterness and a bit of wood pulp texture also coats the tongue . overall i think i prefer the base beer to this , but as a wood aging experiment it certainly succeeds ."

S"yet another review of opb ( other people 's beer ) , from the fridge at the house in which i 'm staying . poured into a pint-type glass , the best i had . no head to speak of , color is a dark black but does n't look too thick . i love the name `` black toad '' but the sketchy description of `` choicest hops '' sounds like schlitz , so no points for the bottle . nutty indeed , just as advertised ! not very burnt smell , not much coffee or chocolate , nuts instead . nondescript hops as well but the smell is mostly nuts with maybe some cocoa . ungh . well it is nutty but the taste is a thin , watery , metallic lack of flavor . just how coffee or coke taste wrong if you water them even a little bit , that 's what happened to this -- take a typical good porter and pour a shot or two of water in , stir well . phantomy hints of mint or vanilla on the end and some pleasant hops . malt base is to the sweeter end rather than the burnt . slight metallic aftertaste . mouthfeel is kind of cokelike , thin and fizzy for a porter . makes it easy drinking , though . apparently it 's cheap which is good , it would be cool to see this fill the same niche as yuengling 's porter ( which is better ) in the empty market of cheap dark beer . were this available at bars priced like its grocery store counterparts it would be excellent for putting a few back while focusing on conversation and not paying attention to beer . as is , it 's pretty lackluster for a porter . maybe should be reviewed as an english brown ale , ala abita turbo dog , especially since it claims to be a `` dark ale '' ? might fare better in that company , i give it a 3 in that company i think ."

S"used a '250ml ' hoegaarden glass . ( the bottle was 341ml like most bottles are , but it fit into the glass ) . pours a cloudy yellowy amber with a very nice head . the head retains , but in a very thin manner . it smells like molson export from what i remember of ex . i have had beers that smelled slightly like malty-vomit , but they were from belgium and were made the proper way . those beers were also enjoyed down to the bitterly-sedimented bottom . it does smell like a macrobrew vomitus mass the whole way down the glass . yummy ! the beer is bold at first , but dies off quickly and becomes a macro-aftertaste , um , jamboree ( i ca n't think of a word ) in the mouth . $ 16 for a 12 pack though ! the carbonation is fairly close to hoegaarden 's , which is a nice bonus ... this is a macro after all . almost refreshing , except for the aftertaste of regular macro swill . it is very drinkable though . i pray it does not bring the 'hangover of the macrodemon ' , as i once used to enjoy every weekend in my younger days . overall , this beer does n't have much of what i look for in beers , but for what it is , this beer rules , at least in its own class of beer . it would kick coors to the curb on a hot summer day with no a/c , but this beer does n't even stand up to the beer it was modeled after : hoegaarden . i hate comparing beers , but when a beer is 'inspired ' after a belgian beer , and the colours of the box are blue and silver , ( bottles too ! ) , one has to wonder why a comparison is not valid at all ? like the head , this beer is on the weaker side . remember though , a macro is gaining posts on ba . how bad can this beer really be ? i 'm on my second now , and they seem to go down well . $ 16 !"

S"poured from a nitro-can into an imperial pint glass a - i love watching the bubbles flow towards the bottom of the glass whilst the head forms . black but with ruby highlights when back lit . one finger tight head which stays and stays . lacing is tight and all over . s - um ... yeah . not much here at all . a little sweet and a little bready maybe . t - i followed the can and served it `` extra cold '' so not much to say here either . front and mid have practically nothing but a slight bitterness . back is some roasted malts . m - it 's smooth and creamy . a bit watery though . d - a little thicker than water but not much . creamy when cold but as it warms it seems to thin . i could drink a lot of these with the creaminess and relatively low abv . i 'm quite confused as to why so many people say guinness is filling , quite the contrary . it looks good and goes down easy but that 's about it ."

S'poured from a banadana growler . hazy deep yellow color , with a big white head after and aggresive pour . smells fainly of what a a hefe should smell like , bananas and cloves . not very srong , though . the flavor is there , but it does not make enough of an impression on me , it needs to be stronger . this is still an easy drinking hefe that could be enjoyed by many .'

S'11 oz . serving at taco mac douglasville . when it arrived at the table , it had a pencil-thick head , which rapidly faded . nice lacing on the glass . first off the smell is nothing but fine dark chocolate ... i actually though it smelled better than it tasted . the taste is layer on layer of chocolate , with a roasted grain background , a tinge of hops and booze . the 11 % abv . was hidden one moment and present the next , but still this was an amazing beer experience . the 11 % affirmed the beer as a sipper , but oh my , what a fine time that was . this has rapidly overtaken the creme brulee as my favorites southern tier is .'

S"had one at volpe 's in allentown . bartender poured it and i asked her `` is there supposed to be shit floating in this ? '' so she poured it out and grabbed me another one , which i poured . same result . i 'm all for trying new things , and i 'm not sure whether i just got a couple bottles from a bad batch , but i shit you not - there was easily half and ounce of what appeared to be heavy , milk colored yeast sediments ( it looked like something unmentionable ) floating about in this beer . i was not impressed . here goes ... pour - a cloudy , pale yellow/orange with a heavy amount of sediment floating about . one finger head that dissipates to a negligible amount of lacing . yikes - this looks more like a dare at a frat house than an enjoyable wheat beer , which is how its advertised on the label . nose - a faint whiff of berries with little to nothing else . kind of organic and earthy , but that might be the bar ( one of the only ones left that lets people smoke inside ) . taste - not as bad as it looks , but as weak and unappealing as it smells . im sorry i cant get over the crap floating around in there . how does one market this beer ? i get ( and rather enjoy ) unfiltered wheat ales , but this is absurd - at least filter it a little or let it settle before you bottle it . the taste is a light malt kick , notes of raspberry , banana and italian spice - possibly a cloudy coriander/oregano type flavor . finish is very berry to the point where you know it was extract and not fresh , or even frozen actual fruit . disappointing - this is supposed to be such a big deal in the big easy . mouthfeel - actually okay for the style . body is light but the character is thin and watered down . no balance as everything you get is esters and raspberry . feh ... drinkability - would n't recommend this for anything more than making your sink drain smell faintly like raspberries for an hour . if your into spending thirty dollars a case to do that , this is the beer for you . i still cant get over the crap floating around in there ... something ai n't right ."

S"the beer pours a pale orange , that almost makes a straw yellow ; a bit in between both . there is a nice small white head on it . the nose is filled with a huge earthy , piny , resiny smell . there is also a bit of sweetness as well . the flavour of the double ipa is almost all piny or resiny hops , but a nice sweetness comes through . the sweetness has a touch of citrus or grapefruit . the more you drink the ale , the more the sweetness comes out and the less amount of earthiness comes out ; however , about 90 percent of the time you drink this you can only taste the resiny/piny hops . if you want an absurd amount , then have at it . the most unique iipa i 've ever had for sure . the mouth feel is creamy , but could be a bit more full bodied . i can only really have one of these a night because of the absurd amount of resiny hops ."

S"dogfish head may be the most over-hyped brewery on the planet . the 120 minute ale is simply torture to drink and a perfect example of `` too much of a good thing , , , '' i like spicy food and rare meat . however , i grasp the fallacy in thinking that therefore raw pork and 20 habaneros is a great meal . this is much better but still far from a good beer . i love ipas and other hop heavy styles but there is a a raw quality to this beer that reminds more of green wood than anything else . the alcohol is dialed way back from the 120 but is still far too prevalent throughout . behind the hops and alcohol and pine wood you can actually taste some malt in this one and it lacks the sickening raw sugar taste of the 120 . however being a better drink than the 120 is akin to being a better eat than grubs . to me this is just another overpriced bad beer reliant on image and the tendency of people to want to like things that set them apart from the masses . sometimes , the masses are right -- people are wasting money becayse they put status over good taste ."

S"just your average american macro disguised as a micro . it seemed to me like a mixture between bud light and corona . it does n't have the skunkiness of corona though . i would n't recommend it but it could be a decent beer on a hot summer afternoon after working in the yard . it goes down pretty easily so you could enjoy several without thinking of it . not going to go into a complex review . it is what it is . considering it 's jimmy buffet 's signature brew from anheuser-busch , i did n't expect much and i did n't get much ."

S"appearance : a nice amber-orange color with a thin head of white that did n't last . bad pour , i suppose . smell : some of the classic fall spice ; nutmeg , clove , cinnamon . a very authentic pumpkin smell too . reminds me of a jack-o-lantern . taste : immeadiate notice of the nutmeg and cinnamon gives way to the taste of fresh pumpkin . not as pie-like as other pumpkin beers , this one lets the pumpkin remain the focus of the flavor , with the spices there for support . the malts are smooth and rightly bland , allowing the beer to dwell in its other ingredient . this is a very nice pumpkin ale , and if i ever see it in bottles i 'll reach for a six pack . mouthfeel : nice , not heavy , smooth and moderately carbonated . well paired to the flavor and abv . drinkability : some people get turned off by fruit or spice beers , but this one i think i could have repeatedly . i like that this does n't overstep its bounds at any time in any place . that makes its drinkability great in my book ."

S"rodenbach grand cru pours with 0.75 inches of thin , tan head that lasts about 30 seconds before ringing a val dieu chalice . the body is slightly cloudy and composed of a beautiful , deep ruby hue . shades of brown and garnet distinguish this from the standard rodenbach 's already amazing red body . thin lacing is always visible on the glass . this beer is delightfully tart and bitter on the nose . sharp , fruity flavors of sour green apples and raspberries appear early . sherry vinegar is represented in a very powerful manner followed by a huge rush of yeasty funk . for the flanders red , this is defining beer in terms of smell . a tart , flavorful rush of apple , raspberries and currants start this ale off on a very fruity wave . almost immediately , the microflora and yeast profile explode with the textbook flemish tartness . the tartness is so powerful that there is almost a burning sensation at the back of the mouth . this grand cru finishes incredibly long with a creamy vanilla and black cherry taste riding on the continuous yeast profile . this is the flanders red style at its best . perfect . mouthfeel is highly carbonated , very spicy and viscous enough to coat the palate after each sip . the flemish style is held constant by a huge tartness presence with each sip . drinkabiliy is good when the power and complexity of flavor is considered . still , even with so much flavor it still manages to be refreshing . however , it is certainly a brew to be enjoyed slowly and one bottle is more than enough for one sitting . definitely not an everyday beer and most likely the worst choice to introduce a novice to the style . overall , the leading flanders red available in the us ."

S"had this at dvelcich 's tasting on 07.31.10 - reviewed from notes . glad i could bring this one and share it . i got this bottle from the world famous mikesgroove . thanks to both of these fine ba 's . this pours a brilliantly clear yellow/gold . it is shimmering bright in color . a one finger cap of bone-white head -- composed of realy tight and fine bubbles- like miniscule micro-bubbles . the head settled to a frothy cap but it looked remarkable ! retention was average , but it had great rings of lacing left behind . smell has a little boozy tart green apple -- like granny smiths . a slight boozy bite reminds me of nail polish remover -- but it is very faint and is part of a bouquet that is otherwise quite pleasant . the taste is sweet , malty , a little tart . a crisp green apple note blends into an apple brandy note that really is nice . everyone is comparing this one to the american tripel and we are split- we are all unable to agree which is better . this one is n't quite as refreshing as a regular tripel , but let 's face it , that 's not what we 're here for . a little over medium for the body , but it 's still nice . has less carbonation than the regular , but that is to be expected . the aftertaste is amazing . it is like a sour apple jolly rancher -- nice . the drinkability is high . very easy to drink ."

S"ipa must be a difficult style for breweries to emulate , although i have done quite well at it in my garage . this beer is one a very few that i have poured down the drain . it pours out a hazy golden orange , with barely a hint of a head . things do n't improve from there ... the flavor is rather bland , underhopped even for a pale ale in the pnw . the aftertaste made me cringe , similar to the way that an american megaswill would . i have a few other beers from cascade lakes to try , and i am now a bit hesitant . i 'll have to wait until memory of this one fades ..."

S'2010 batch of stock ale appearance- dark brown to amber red , very thick murky in color , small bubbles stream along the bottom of the glass , tan head starts quick and quickly fades off smell- sweet molasses , slight raisony smell , rum , slight alcohol , and slight hopping on the nose taste- starts up front with a real lot of malts , and slight hop in mid palate but not much , sweet malts , overall though very boozy flavor almost like tasting a straight liquor or rum , may need some age to really mellow of that heat , mouthfeel- heavy thick and viscous , alot going on here in this very heavy beer drinkability- at this current point at least in this beers life i have to be realistic and admits its drinkablity is fairly low , theres just to much heat and not a great balance , i would be intrigued to see how this balances out in a couple year time but i think this is one if i had a 4pack of id certainly be cellaring for bit ,'

S'appearance - cloudy dark red , 2 fingers of creamy head with good retention and lacing . smell - fairly strong passionfruit-like hops . taste - the passionfruit in the aroma is barely detectable in the flavour , which is dominated by burnt caramel-like malts . the hops are too spicy , and do not provide enough fruity counterbalance to the malts . mouthfeel - medium bodied . definitely too cloying for the style . drinkability - not an easy drinker by any standards . overall - this is certainly a flavoursome beer , but too much of the flavour is burnt and metallic .'

S"batch 003 . poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass . cork comes off explosively . an aggressive pour produced a ton of white fluffy head . color is yellowish tan with champagne like heavy carbonation . the smell of apple and chardonnay are amazing . also the malts smell of tree bark . smells kind of like a musky white wine . the taste of wine is the first thing that went through my head . makes my cheeks tingle upon swallowing . taste is also similar to the smell : apples and chardonnay . does n't really wonder on my tongue but maybe its not supposed to ? mouthfeel is great : heavily carbonated with a lighter body . drinkablility is good . just like champagne , i 'm not so sure that i 'd want to drink more than one bottle ( unless it were new years eve ) . overall , a very well crafted beer . russian river definitely broke the mold with this one ."

S'poured a very light crystal clear golden color . what i would expect from a good lager . started out with a large 2-finger head , which dissipated quickly leaving no lacing . smelled buttery , some corn , malt , and slight hops scent . nothing special . taste was a bit off for me . i was expecting a nice crisp , clean taste and instead i got a metallic taste with a slight soapy aftertaste . maybe a hint of lemon in there too . had a watery feel to it , yet left my mouth feeling dry afterwards . as the beer warmed the metallic taste mellowed more , so the taste was a bit more enjoyable . i would say this is a very drinkable brew , if you can get past the wierd metal taste .'

S"i picked up the growler form capone 's in norristown on wednesday and had it in the fridge until sunday when i had the opportunity to share it with akorsak , bookert & phnphilly . appearance : pours from the growler black with little head initially but then the carbonation seems to come into force and out of nowhere it pushes up a big frothy chocolaty brown head . smell : i 'll admit i have a cold but it was my opportunity to try this beer . i could smell the others but this one must have a more reserved aroma because i got little from it . i did detect some of the roastyness and hints of coffee . taste : this is a straightforward roasty stout . not bad . it is built to be approachable and easy to drink . bitter coffee molasses and roasted chocolate on the palate . it certainly improved as it warmed up and glass after glass was better than the first . still it remained a bit one-dimensional . mouthfeel : medium body lightly and dry , a bit chalky in the mouth , with an almost astringent finish . drinkability : for a stout fan this is certainly a sessionable beer . it is better as it warms . it you found a place that would serve it at the right temperature it 'd be a great bar beer , though less than exciting for a tasting . hope this is helpful . cheers !"

S"a - it 's black . no light is able to penetrate the egdes of my glass . the high abv keeps any real head from forming . there are a couple patches of foam here and there but that 's it . no lacing to speak of . pretty much what i expected . s - big dark fruit aromas permeate the entire aroma . cherry , plum , raisin , they are all there . some chocolate creeps in toward the end . of course , at 17.5 % , alcohol dominates . period . t - taste is actually pretty bad . think fingernail polish remover mixed with rubbing alcohol and chocolate covered cherries . this is just not for me . on the plus side , it does have a sherry kind of flavor going on . that does n't even come close to pulling the flavor out of the gutter though . m - full bodied with little to no carbonation . finish is hot and sweet with the dark fruit that seems to come and go . if your wondering , it 's hot . d - drinkability is non-existant . it 's just too harsh and hot to enjoy on any level . do n't bother letting it warm because it is just as bad at room temperature . i know mikkeller has produced some fine brews but this one should have gotten the axe before it was even released . avoid ."

S"thanks solomon . rare live tick . have n't reviewed in a while , though i have a few backlogged . pours black into my tulip with a good one finger foam that fades to a ring , very little lace . revived a bit on subsequent pours . for some reason i decided to open this decadence by myself ... . tons of rich charred barrel , molasses , brown sugars , caramelized , deep developed flavors here . vanillias , bourbon barrel , very complex , but pretty heavy at the same time . the first glass was enjoyed but the real weight of this beer came through on subsequent pours . not overly boozy , just a slight hint in the finish and a touch in the nose as it warmed . mostly just heavy due to the immense richness and boldness of the flavors here . more and more i 'm getting rich complex caramel flavors , really mouth coating like a werthers . touch of bitterness and ends a touch lighter but still robust . another great blend but really lends itself to being shared ."

S"beer reviewed from detailed notes taken last night . it was the fourth and final beer of my evening and it really kicked my ass . i do n't remember getting from the kitchen to the upstairs and woke up in the guest bedroom this morning . pours a sticky off-white ( orangish ) head over a mildly cloudy light yellow-amber liquid . smells of corn alcohol and cardboard . uh-oh , i 'm gon na regret this one . the head has settled to a sticky thin layer and it 's left decent lacing on the inside of the glass . a second smell is like stale bubble-gum . as if you chewed a piece all day , set it on the dresser when you went to bed , and stuck it back in your mouth the next morning . sawdust dry . tastes sweet malty to start , then funky ( funk gives me the willies ) . it 's not a phenoilic belgian funk , it 's more like a strong version of the hint of funk i find in oktoberfests . the beer is dry and there is a bit of sweet fruity ester in there . canned pear syrup , i guess . md light body and highly carbonated . no thanks ."

S"me and a few buddies decided on a special occasion worthy enough and broke a bottle of rare out of the cellar . hand-written bottle number 872 , bottled on november 19th , 2010 . `` this stout was aged for two years in the finest old barrels goose island has used in its 18 years of bourbon barrel-aging beers ! a true rarity - savor and share it only with those you hold dear , as it will never be made again . cheers ! '' poured into chalices and shared amongst three friends . jet black with a raspberry hot chocolate head . the head 's color speaks of hot chocolate with touches of red , ruby and mahogany . the appearance is much the same as bcbs of any year , as one would expect , with its normal viscous nature and fully opaque , pitch black body . the aroma is a rich medley of roast ( perhaps burnt chocolate ) , heavy bourbon , oak , cordial cherries with hints of vanilla and licorice . alcohol is present and the bourbon is not shy in its arrival in the nostrils as it should n't be with such a grandiose name as rare bourbon county brand stout . the bouquet leads directly into the flavor which echoes it 's bcbs counterparts . rich , creamy and bourbon forward as expected . the bourbon is quite rich and this beer quite oaky with such a smooth mouthfeel that enjoying this stout is no problem for any beer or whiskey lover . though spirit-forward , there is plenty else going on . fruity esters centered on cherry mix with oak , dark chocolate malt , roasted barley , dark crystal malts and light vanilla . the caramel malts seem to help accentuate the creaminess while the bourbon sticks to the sides of your mouth . goes down warm . the warming has a bit of a heavier impact than previous bcbss that i 've come across . warmth is ever-present from the tip of the tongue all the way down throughout the tasting . though highly enjoyable , this does n't hit the high expectations set by it 's `` rare '' denomination or extravagant price tag . make no arguments about it , this beer is a fantastic bourbon barrel aged stout but , at the same time , has been hyped to a point beyond what any beer should . approach blindly as you would any other imperial stout and you shall be pleasantly surprised . drinkability ? at $ 40 a bottle ? a little less than exceptional ... sans that , a fantastically delicious beer ."

S"on nitro draft at a tulsa bennigans , harp lager can be summed up in one word : `` weird '' . why would anyone serve a european-style pilsner with nitrogen gas ? if you know something that i do n't here , please beer mail me . the beer arrived in a trademark bennigans true pint glass . creamy but thin head that had some staying and clinging power , aided by the n2 gas , no doubt . aroma was kraft caramels and butterscotch and that is off-style again . the flavor was good and complemented the meal ( chicken ) well . somewhat easy to drink . i say `` somewhat '' because the slightly unnerving detail of little or no co2 bite and no effervescence detracted from the appeal of this type of beer . the mouthfeel was more like a guinness . it was out of place . at least it washed down the meal very well and left with a clean , pleasant finish . i liked this beer on co2 better . i will review it again from a co2 draft or from a bottle soon ."

S'oh good lord , who the hell thought this was a good idea ? thank you , devin . the only good thing about this beer is the appearance - a nice , dark brown/black pour with a dense , light brown head with excellent retention and lacing . the nose has a ton of pumpkin spices ( cinnamon , nutmeg and allspice ) and mothefucking cedar . the smell of wood dust and moth balls permeates this abomination , and destroys your palate , sucking it dry , making the pumpkin spices stick out even more . mildly roasty , maybe , but overly cedar-like , to the point where it tastes like mothballs . awful , one of the worst beers of the year imo'

S"pours a clear copper , with a foamy white head and moderate-low head retention . the nose is pleasant and fruity , with additional subtle hints of pepper . the flavor profile is a bit on the sweet side . the caramel malts are pronounced , with notes of biscuit and a mild nuttiness . the hoppy bitterness at the finish is quite restrained , perhaps a bit too restrained . but overall this is a crisp , highly quaffable brew . as i see it , harpoon ale is the kind of beer that one should always have on hand . what it lacks in complexity it makes up for in drinkability . it compliments most meals , and , lacking the high hoppiness of other american pale ales , it 's also the kind of beer that often appeals even to non-bas ."

S"poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass appearance : a light golden color , minimal size head yields decent lacing down the glass . lots of bubbles here as well . smell : almost artificial in aromas , a bit of citrus is here , but gets drowned out by a wheat/grassy mix . lots of lemon coming off here as well . taste : hmm.. this has a similar taste to lemon seltzer . very lemony , but again , artificial in the taste . some toastiness pops its head out , which is a relief , but is no match to such a strong lemony presence . mouthfeel : prickly carbonation makes this hard to drink more then 2 , loads of carbo here , again , almost like a soda . i 'm wondering if this is even a beer ? drinkability : overall , i did n't hate it , but it 's got loads of issues that need to be corrected . i think if the lemony bite was smoothed out and the toasted element i got was maximized , this could be a decent sessioner . the carbonation needs to be lowered alot as well , it made the beer almost unbearable to finish . glad i only bought a bottle of this , or i would have been very disapointed ."

S"looks like a macro only with a very nice , retentive head that scores it some points . smells like an adjunct . very light nothingness mixed with a spark of grain . tastes like almost nothing at all . what little flavor is present is decent , but nothing to write home about . it 's got just the slightest hint of pilsner to it -- grain mash . i could see myself pounding these , if i was forced to . if nothing else , tecate is completely inoffensive . but really , why bother ?"

S"got this with a burger at a local pub which , to my annoyance , had no bell 's on tap . this ipa was a heavily clouded orange hue with a small head , as i drank it it left significant amounts of lacing on the glass . scent was what i would term moderate for an ipa , subdued hops , with minor citrus tones . taste , well , not bad at all , but not remarkable either . there was a decent hit of citrus , and some hop bite which sticks around but does n't take control of the flavour at any point . a standard rind aspect snuck in on the back end , but nothing overwhelming . mouth was again , decent , light and carbonated , pretty standard for the style . the only place i would give this beer decent marks is on drinkability . another run of the mill brew from arcadia , a local that has yet to blow me away ."

S"yet another beer not available in oklahoma . let 's give this bad boy a try . a : pours a light amber/orange with about one finger of fairly receding off white head . carbonation is definitely prevalent in the body of the brew . s : grain sweetness , slight molasses and caramelized sugar lead the scent of this beer . this is finished with a slight straw smell . ( pardon the alliteration . ) t : roasted grain with a mild woody/oaky finish to it . further accentuated with the same straw characteristics . the hops never seem to play a major part in the character of this beer . m : lighter on the tongue than one would expect due to the color . very medium bodied with a soda like finish . the body seems false , however . whereas a good pilsner is crisp , clean and bitter , this brew seems to imbibe a larger body that quickly dissipates into macro brew-like fizziness . d : easy to drink . hell , at this point in my career , most beers are easy to drink . some may call it a macro with caramel coloring , but this beer has more body and taste than most for nine dollars a twelver ."

S"i like to revisit this beer once a year or so . great memories of my years living in the eifel region . my place was located less than a mile from the brewery and that fresh grain and hoppy aroma was always a pleasant start to my days . poured into a pils glass it is a yellow bodied brew with carbonation clinging to the side of the glass . tight white head maintains a solid cover on top of the brew . ring lace . soft grain at the get go gets slightly husky as it warmed . nice drying hop bitterness about 3/4 of the way through . there is a slightly woody kendlin type backer and charcoal suggestions . very refreshing . my only complaint is the grainy taste up front gets a bit annoying towards the end of each beer . notes : nostalgia may get the best of me here but as subjective as i can be this is a solid , refreshing well brewed beer . i remember it having a bit more depth and there was this drying charcoal presence that was delightfull . i still get some of that but its probably more a west coast palate change than anything they 've done . pick up a sixer ."

S"the apple-flavored offering of unibroue 's ephemere pours a fluffy clean white that almost immediately dissipates into thin lacing . it pours like a cloudier witbier relative . pretty much the exact appearance one would expect from an `` apple '' flavored fruit beer . ephemere apple packs a potent , almost artificial apple smell . i 'm pretty sure it 's granny smith , as the packaging hints . a more trained nose may also pick up on remote hints of cinnamon and perhaps nutmeg . the taste is crisp , carbonated and exclusively apple . personally , i enjoy the taste of apple pie , but this one is a bit too strong on the flavoring . i 'd almost go as far as to say it tastes like a very fine cider , but i would n't want to knock an outstanding brewery like unibroue . the taste is adequate , and i do enjoy it . however , i just do n't feel like this is how a beer should taste , even a fruit beer . it 's too close to a cider in my opinion . the presence of a malty backbone and virtually no hoppy notes should also be noted . despite the lackluster taste , phmre apple is still above-average in the mouthfeel & drinkability categories . fans of fruit beers , apples and sweeter-tasting brews will all enjoy this , while fans of bigger beers will laugh in the face of phmre . although i purchased this at the end of august , i purposely waited until the new england autumn to review this ( apple ) beer . my experiement definately passed , but not with flying colors . this one gets the job done as a crisp , light beer on a summer evening . it also does the job as a nice after meal beer on a cool october evening in new england . the problem is , it just `` gets the job done . '' there 's absolutely nothing spectacular about this one , but at the same time , i did n't mind drinking it at all ."

S"pours with a frothy , reasonably dense , initially three-finger thick , browned , tan colored head . the beer is an almost black , deeply burnt , brown color . aromas of roast grain are quite prominent ; slightly acrid , deeply burnt , dark coffee roast , burnt raisins are all noticeable . there is also something that reminds me a bit of tart plum , concord grapes , and perhaps even a bit of other-than-roast contributed sourness in the nose . first sip , this is definitely far more sour than the roast character could ever hope to contribute . the beer is fairly dry at this point , and certainly seems to be quite a bit more thin than one would expect . underneath the sourness is the subdued roast character , which would otherwise be the dominant note . as far as sourness goes , the tartness is quite pleasant with a rounded fruit note to it , but it just does n't work in this beer . it is really unfortunate that siletz has this bottling infection problem , as most of the bottled brews i have had have had varying levels of infection . the funk lover in me ca n't help but think that this particular bug would work quite well in a bottled saison style beer , alas this is not that style ."

S"i had to try this one based soley on its bad reputation when i finally ran acrossed it . pours a golden piss yellow color with no head to speak of ... fizzes like sprite . there is a slight adjuncty grain aroma which is covered by the spicey aroma of chili pepper..barely smells like a beer at all . i 'm not one for really spicey foods ( so why did i bother to try this ? morbid curiosity ) , but this seems to be bang on for what i imagine a good chili beer to be like ... tastes like drinking the burning rivers of hell . there is a slight sweetness up front which is obliterated by the spiciness of the chili immediately . mouthfeel ? i can barely feel my mouth , which once again , i can think of one or two people who would love this ... but its not for me so much . extreme and crazy to be sure ... my digestive tract may never be the same again ..."

S"looks like motor oil as it pours out of the bottle . thick , black , and no head . seriously , no carbonation , no head . it 's just syrup . kinda unfortunate since the aroma and taste have potential . dark fruits like plums and raisins with some cherry flavors all mixed with the sweet flavors of alcohol . i have a feeling it could be perfect 5 's all across the board if they would make it a little more drinkable ."

S'the colour is yellow with a tint of gold ; the white foam is quite compact , but it dissolves quickly . the smell is medium strong with a bittersweet feel . there are notes of malt , aroma hops ( somewhat artificial ) and salt . the carbonation is fresh and not too sharp . the taste got a distinct taste of white bread and diacetyl , giving it a robust body . there is some sweetness ( toffee ? ) with a burned note . the finishing flavour got a dry touch of dark rye bread . in the aftertaste , i noticed a rather mild bitterness and some sweet malt . a classic in denmark is a lager that got some more body and a little more gold in the colour . i found this one better than most of the standard danish pale lagers .'

S"*sigh* ok , i had this at a party this weekend . the host offered it to me , with the statement `` i knew you were going to be here , so i was going to get something fancy like rolling rock , but did n't have time . '' she was n't kidding . appearance is pale yellow , no head . smell is corny . no hops . taste is corn , sweetness , but clean . mouthfeel is like distilled water ... absolutely nothing here . despite all of that , it is highly drinkable from the standpoint of being so utterly bland that it 's inoffensive ."

S'dispensed from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass . pours a very dark brown , almost black , but not quite . almost a dark purple color . interesting and beautiful . a perfectly smooth and frothy tan head , looks just like an espresso topper . sweet smelling with plenty of coffeelike caramel notes . slightly fruity with some raisins and figs thrown in . alcohol and fusels join the party as well . wow . sweet and alcoholic . some hoppiness but the alcohol is a bit overwhelming . a sweet , alcoholic mess . creamy on the tongue saves this beer a little bit . i was impressed with the first two categories but the rest was downhill . i keep trying these beers from dfh and am continually let down . perhaps , i have learned my lesson . i will not be having this one again , assuming i can even finish this one .'

S"i picked up a bunch of beers to cellar last night ; i picked this up to save a few bucks . it 's a drinkable beer for the price point . it 's very sweet with a very mild hoppiness that does n't really balance . it 's got a decent level of carbonation , but it somehow seemed flat at times ( probably just because it sits heavy on the tongue for a lighter beer ) . not one to seek out , but if you find it on the shelf you might as well give it a try ( it 's too cheap to pass up ) ."

S"split a bottle of this with slander and schoolteacher at spuyten duyvil . yes , we each had a serving the size of a brandy pour , which is appropriate for this beer . did n't take notes , but did n't need to . taste it once , and you remember it forever . glowing deep red , no head ... ok maybe a little head . smells like a fresh raspberry harvest , as if you were stomping around in a vat of raspberries and the aroma were permeating your senses . tastes like a red velvet raspberry cake with chocolate truffles , or perhaps like one of those jacques torres chocolates filled with raspberry puree . in fact , put this inside of chocolates , and they 'd sell like hotcakes , i bet . i found the taste to be a bit too much like a raspberry cordial , and not enough like a beer , but unique nonetheless . the mouthfeel is quite remarkable -- `` pillowy '' is the first word that came to mind . just so soft in the mouth , almost makes you think you 're eating a piece of cake . an after-dinner sipper to be sure , not drinkable by any means . if you had any more than the small bottle of this at a sitting , i predict a big headache for you . i would love to be able to revisit this one in , say , about 10 years ."

S"cask pint at watch city on 9/9/06 . nearly `` bright '' though with just a touch of light haze . still transparent and with a large , grey/beige head that is tremendously well-retained and laces quite profusely . the body is a deep copper-auburn with strong mahogany tones . fresh edinburgh yeast contributes light earthy/soiliness , while some moderate dark malts contribute very subtle dark fruit flavors in concert with the yeast notes . minimal hop apparency , though some green leafiness and bits of grass do help bolster the livliness of it . touches of very light caramel , pale sugars and a hint of coffee on the end . notes are presented cleanly , crisply and the aroma is quite strong and vibrant . no alcohol noted , definitely no flaws that i can detect . very inviting . a warm , fuzzy-soft texture is alive with fruit , nuts , dry caramel and some dusty/earthy yeast on the end.snappy esters dry out the finish and give it a crispness that belies the low gravity nature of the beer . plenty of nougat and dark berry notes packed in here , and just a clean presentation with surprisingly little wateriness , even less than what would be expected/tolerable . goes down softly and easily . i think i drank my pint in about 2 minutes . one of the better conditions ive seen a cask in , here in new england ."

S"11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass . pours a bright hazy blonde color topped by an equally bright fluffy white head which is retained very well for a wild ale and leaves some stringy lacing as it goes . aroma ... this is a doozy . dirty socks , wet cardboard and soft cheesy pungency . no i 'm not kidding . behind that ridiculousness there 's a hint of some hops but this beer is really about the wild elements . as is the case in many of the wilder beers out there it 's not as wacky on the palate as it is on the nose . there are dry and earthy brett notes and a leafy herbal hop profile on the entry followed by a buggy and slightly phenolic aftertaste . even for a lover of brett and funk this is n't a highly drinkable beer . the somewhat bizarre aroma and the slight imbalance on the flavor profile make it a slow drinker . i 'm really not sure if this came out the way mikkeller intended or not . if the goal was just to see how far they could crank up the volume on the brett funk then they succeeded but if they were looking to brew something that tasted great i 'll have to say they fell a little short . overall an interesting experience but unlikely to be a repeat purchase ."

S'pours out all foam . thick , full , medium tan color head . even after that died down , after a very long time , it left a strong and persistant cap on the beer . the color under all of that foam was a very cloudy reddish brown . the color was quite light and full , and there were highlights of an even brighter orange in it as well , and there are many lazy strings of bubbles rising up through it . a fun-looking beer , by all standards , though that head is a bit annoying . upon adding the yeast shot later , the color darkened substantially into a ruddy brown and became all but opaque . the nose is strong , with a sort of soapiness riding on spices . the soapy smell is one that ive noticed in all of their beers , it may have something to do with the water but it is characteristic . beyond that hard to pin down herbal spiciness , there isnt much else in there . first taste is alcohol ! lots of it . its warm in the mouth , and warm on the throat going down . honestly that flavor dominates . there is a sweetness from the malts , and some strong hops that overpower the sweetness with their grapefruit bitterness . this bitterness combines with the heavy alcohol taste on the aftertaste to make for a powerful kick . there is a subtle hint of vanilla beans when a slug is in your mouth , but its fleeting . that soap off-taste is certainly still there , and is most noticeable on retro-olfaction . this is far from a balanced flavor . any balance is knocked off by the alcohol first , and then the hops ride on that to further tip the scales . the label says that there is coriander , orange peel , nutmeg and cinnamon in here as well as the vanilla ; but honestly i wouldnt have picked up those other flavors if i wasnt looking for them . i suppose if youre really looking for it you can taste the orange just a bit , and the cinnamon lends a sort of heat but its hard to tell it apart from the alcohol heat . after adding the yeast , the flavor did calm down just a bit , but it is still a virtually unstoppable monster of flavor . the mouthfeel is rather pleasantly heavy , but it serves to intensify the taste which is somewhat questionable so thats a double-edged sword . this is not what i would call a drinkable beer . i can get through this bottle , but anything beyond that is out of the question for me . i am not a big fan of strong hops , so perhaps those who are will find more to like here , but for me this is just not that great'

S"750ml bottle , dated 2003 , drank near the end of july 2008 . now this is what i am talkin ' about ! a 5 year old gueuze -- well , almost , since these things are traditionally brewed in the fall . but let 's not get into semantics . the beer is fantastic . a deliciously balanced beer , almost too balanced . the funk and the sour ca n't quite decide which one wins , and that is pretty nice . the beer has a nice , rich smell . candle wax , pineapple , kiwi , and mango . the taste expands upon the smell . it adds layers of candle wax , lemon , swiss cheese , armpit sweat , cheddar cheese , cheap processed american cheese , chalk , lychee , kumquat , and very dry white wine . a very good experience , but i have to say that there are better lambics out there . now , that is always the case that there is a better beer somewhere , but i mean that there are some fresh lambics that i think surpass this deliciously aged example . that does n't mean it is n't fantastic , it is . but it lacks that sour bite that i love in lambics ( as is provided by the likes of hanssens and cantillon ) while not being overboard with bretty esters ( such as 3 fonteinen ) . good , but not mind-blowing . personally , i think they overdid it on the alcohol , which leads to the waxy taste and texture ."

S"pours a really clear yellow with a head that dissolves into literally nothing . looks like a high alcohol beer because of the no head . i guess it does n't matter with appearance of this beer since most people would just drink this out of the can or bottle anyways . i can smell some fruitiness which what smells like to me belgian yeast strain with some very light wheat malt . the taste is crisp right up front with the wheat malt and belgian yeast combining together with a quick flash of hop which is so subtle its barely noticeable until it warms then it becomes slightly more noticeable . i can tell coors makes blue moon and uses the same yeast in that beer as it does this one same malt too . it 's so drinkable its ridiculous though you could finish this beer so quickly . i almost think they dial back the flavor just so that you keep drinking it more and faster so you can let the flavor build up on your tongue more ... which is the only way you can tell what flavors it has . you also get your typical corn smell and taste in this as well but not as much as other adjunct beers . i actually like this better than budweiser regular and miller because of that slight belgian yeast fruitiness that it gives off combining with that pretty okay subtle wheat malt . i do n't know why you 'd drink coors light when this is light and extremely drinkable enough . definitely not horrible by any means . get this if you want the best of the 3 ."

S"radlermass ? never heard of it , but sounds german . i half expected this not to appear on beer advocate , given it 's marketed as a lemonade beer . appearance : well not a lot to complain about here . it laced incredibly well and produced a finger and a half of head . did n't quite retain as well as i would have liked it to though . the body is a bit of a dull yellow that is n't quite lager yellow . good start smell : a sugary sweet lemon smell that 's like lemon aid but lacking in the sour twang i would expect . i think that because i might be picking up some hops that is bringing those elements down . taste : it starts with a light sweet lemon taste , more like strong lemon iced tea then lemon-aid . i then become abundantly clear that lemon pop syrup was used in this as the sweetness declines and some not very roasted malt makes and appearance ending with a soapy hop note . i never though i 'd use the word soapy to describe the taste of beer . it 's not as bad as i 'm making it out to be , but it 's not the greatest . mouthfeel : syrup and soap , need i say more ? the problem here is the soap does n't clean out the syrupy stickiness which lingers far too long and makes the whole beer taste sickly artificial at first . then you get used to it like you were drinking pop and it just seems harder to notice . the worst part about it , is the carbonation really gives that sudsy soap feeling , only that 's it 's an edible taste . however the sweetness of the pop like syrup would probably be better served with more aggressive carbonation . i do n't think i like this part of the beer . drinkability : it 's smooth , almost a little too smooth , but it 's also very light and is clearly designed to be guzzled on a hot summer day . that overwhelming sweetness needs to be reigned in desperately though . final thoughts : it 's odd that 's for sure and i think with some more tweaking it would be a lot better . this is the kind of beer i think would go well at a baseball game with a hotdog or a pogo . it 's so sudsy , happy and filled with things that you know are bad for you . so if this beer is around in 4 or 5 years , maybe i 'll give it another shot . this is probably one beer , despite it 's poor grade , i would still recommend trying because it seems so different . i 'd like to see another brewer give this a shot , maybe with real lemon ."

S"pours out a mostly clear brilliant yellow colour ... a thin fine bone white head appears and is sustained by some active carbonation . bits of lace . pretty clean smelling ... lots of pale malts ... sort of pils smelling . a hint of spice , too . very light spice and orange peel flavour ; mildly malty and a hint of bittering hops . slightly fruity and estery . i 'd say the mouthfeel and body are on the light side ... keeping it quite slammable especially after a hot day like today . i 'm not quite up to snuff on american versions of belgian style wits , but i 'm sure this was brewed for delicate and finicky american tastes . therefore it 's quite tame in my opinion . a nice summer slammer . thanks to beer angel for the sample !"

S"single bottle ( no date ) served in a milkshake pilsner glass . appearance : mostly clear ( very slight haze ) dark golden yellow with a persistent 1/8 : dense white head . strands of lacing here and there , but persistent lacing . i think the haze may be from sediment - there were one or two little `` floaters '' that came along with the pour . smell : faint floral hops , along with a faint grassiness when the beer is cold . not very strong . taste : a mild flavored pilsner . floral hop bitterness up front , then a honey-like finish . very mild in flavor overall - i 'd almost say delicate . mouthfeel : very mild carbonation on the tongue , despite seeing a lot of bubble coming up in the glass . a little bit watery . drinkability : i 'm wondering if this one is past its prime since the flavors are so mild . it 's just okay . i guess i was expecting something with more bite and crispness to it , which this does not have ."

S"although not outstanding , this is a very nice scottish ale i had on tap at henry 's 12th st tavern in portland . red amber , like a redder version of bridgeport blue heron , it has a lasting thin foamy top that diminishes only slowly and leaves a little weak foamy lace . aroma is malty , fruity , very toasty , hints of cherry . taste is very fruity-malty with firm toastiness and a mellow clear nuttiness . light spicey-earthy hop joins in before a long caramelly-toasty malt aftertaste . it is very drinkable , not overly complex , but well-rounded and with good , firm character very fitting for a scottish ale ."

S"this beer poured an extremely hazy copper color with very , very minimal head . smell was very much like a sweet tropical punch . pineapple , mango , grapefruit ... little to none of the pine notes i 've come to expect from ipas . taste was pretty much in line with the smell . kind of like someone had spiked the tropical punch with some rum . though , for 9.5 % , the alcohol is pretty well disguised . not nearly as boozy as some of the dipas i 've had . ( dfh 90 , i 'm looking at you ... ) overall , i think the beer is probably a touch too syrupy and sweet to make a good session beer , but to be fair , i 'm rarely looking to make a session out of a 9 % + abv beer . verdict : definitely an interesting take on the dipa style , but misses a lot of the traditional bitter hoppiness that i enjoy . note : the bottle informs me that this was brewed back in may . it 's very possible i had this a bit off its peak . i 'd certainly be willing to give the 3rd anniversary ale a fairer shot next year ."

S"spinnakers in victoria imports this beer in and my father kindly procured some for me to drink . i had this beer years ago and forgotten how smooth this brew goes down . big brown head on top of jet black body this is a pretty sight . the real clincher is the coffee and roasted barley nose that hints at the figs and chocalate notes in the first sip . there are very few porters this smooth and balanced and this is a direct relation to fritz 's admonition to qualtiy ."

S'served from tap into a clean , clear pint glass during my visit to the brewery this week . i did not record the abv but i believe it to be 4 % to 5 % . i will leave it blank for someone to possibly come behind me and complete it correctly . a medium to dark brown , translucent body under very minimal head . 2.5 s no smell that i could detect . maybe it was all of the sights , sounds and smells there at the brewery but i smelled this beer 3 or 4 times and could not get any smell . 2.0 t light malt , kind of distant with minimal hops to match . this beer is very forgettable . 2.5 m minimal syrupy stickiness , bigness but only slight . 3.0 d good drinkability but this is a forgettable amber to me . 4.0'

S"pours a very orange hued amber color with a nice firm , bright white head that slowly dissipates . moderate visible carbonation . well all be ding dong . huge whiff of freshly peeled orange on the first smell . the second round provides a solid push of sweetened pine resin , i am talking seriously strong pine . a touch of sweet caramelized malt at the end of the spectrum makes this far and out one of the best smelling brews i have had the opportunity to put my nose up to . the taste is chock full of super fresh grapefruit pith and ( like in the nose ) freshly peeled orange . a ( i ca n't explain it either ) strong but mild pine presence makes itself known right off the bat . the malt backbone is there , but it is hard to grasp after the aggressive hop assault on the tongue . amazing , simply amazing . almost no hint of the 9.5 % . almost perfection . the mouthfeel is on frickin point . ample carbonation and very slick on the tongue , nothing i can complain about . at all . one of the best brews i have had to date . hands down . i would be drunk and living on the streets if this was available in minnesota ."

S"sounded like a different beer . imperial cream ale . topaz colored beer pours with a slight haze . sweet aroma has hints of bubble gum laced with noble hops . on the palate , the bitterness is fairly harsh . dusty pine rosin coats the tongue and obscures most of the malt flavor . alcohol warmth is noticeable , but the body feels a bit thin , too dry for an `` imperial '' beer . feels more like an altbier in the mouth . seems like the yeast really attenuated even with the higher alcohol . it would be interesting to find out which yeast they used . as for drinkability - glad i bought just one ."

S"i think this can be a rather confusing beer as dogfish is definitely trying to bring together the best of two worlds ( that being an ipa and nut brown ale ) . by default you may be tempted to judge it against other brown ales because of the color and head when you pour it , but since that was n't the brewery 's intention that 'd be a bit foolish . my instinct is that the beer itself is a bit too hoppy for for a brown ale , but for intents and purposes , they did a fine job of bringing that aspect of the ipa together well with complexity of the malts of a brown ale . the hops are n't overwhelming by any stretch , and you get a healthy dose of almost coffee like maltness in the aftertaste . a good beer , but definitely not one that i 'd try drinking more than one or two in one sitting . probably would go really well with a huge chunk of chocolate cake too ."

S'this is not what you would expect from an american ipa . it pours like an ipa but a little too tranparent . at first taste you think , was that water ? but then the flavors sneak up on in the middle of the taste . overall the hop flavors are a little weak but the smoothness is unique . alaskan did the same thing with their pale , but technically that is a golden and should be that way . the ipa could really use some more hop flavor , but if you want to get wasted off an ipa taste this is the beer for you .'

S"750 ml bottle , served in my duvel tulip . zuur pours a murky , swampwater brown . there are faint ruby highlights when the beer is held to light . the bone colored cap is a decent two fingers in height , and there 's not much in the way of lacing . the nose is pretty good , some biscuit and caramel , as well as a distinct acidic tartness . the flavor takes the aforementioned malt notes and adds a swirl of chocolate . dark fruits ( largely cherries , but i definitely find some plum in there as well ) act as a transition to a fruity , acidic , moderately sour close . the body is a little thin , and the carbonation a little low , but zuur coats my mouth with each sip . the relatively restrained tartness combined with the great taste lead to zuur being about as drinkable as any beer with a wild/sour component that i 've ever had . a great offering from ommegang ."

S'had this at an oysterbar in the ferry building , sf . its dark espresso colour , lively appearance , and heaps of lacing were a welcome sight . the head was small and it dissipated fast . the aroma was smoky with hints of bittersweet chocolate . the taste started hoppy , smoothed over with a chocolate mouthful , followed by a finish of burnt-toast . long hang . drier than i expected for an american stout . the mouthfeel was lively but smooth . full bodied . the burnt malt hang definitely killed its drinkability for me personally , but my dad , who for some reason likes the taste of carcinogens , found it very drinkable .'

S"poured from 1 pint nitro-can into nonic pint glass . oh and by the way , when opening a can , be sure your glass is near by ... or at least a towel . a - beautiful pour , with a head that starts at the bottom of the glass and settles into a 2-3 finger head . lacing ? that would imply spots where the foam is n't covering the glass . in this case there is only a solid film of foam . s - not much there in the way of smell , though i detect a very faint suggestion of vanilla . t - again , there is n't much taste . a mild malt flavor is about the only thing going on . the finish leaves a nasty aftertaste , something metallic . i have to constantly sip this beer to avoid feeling like i 'm chewing on a penny . m - the mouthfeel is extraordinary . just as the can says , `` smooth and creamy . '' this beer goes down as silky as a sherry flip . d - despite the lack of flavor , i could drink these all night . i tend to go for boddingtons after i 've been drinking a bit and my tastebuds are a little numb ; rarely do i start a night off with this virtually flavorless beer . still , an impressive pour and a smooth sip are ( sometimes ) all you need . a little expensive for what it is , but c'est la vie . while this beer seriously lacks in it 's two most important aspects ( nose and taste ) , it *almost* redeems itself with it 's ultra-smoothness . this beer wo n't blow anyone away , and you 'll probably be asking yourself `` where 's the flavor ? '' but before that , the thought of `` damn that 's smooth ! '' will cross your mind first ."

S'a - pours inky black with a smattering of bubble on top . reddish hues around the edges . s - the smell is pretty subtle . is that banana ? strange . a tiny bit of malt . t - very creamy . a bit of chocolate doughnut . slightly bitter finish . definitely a different imperial stout . the alcohol is only showing up after a few drinks as a slight warmness in the back of the throat . very good compared to the smell . m - smooth . not too thick . d - this goes down really easy . i would have no problem drinking a couple of these .'

S"bottled 12/31/09 . a- pours a clear goldenrod color with a one finger head . s- grapefruit , pineapple and caramel malt are present aromas . t- bitter grapefruit , pine , and orange with a mild caramel malt backbone , and finishes with an unpleasantly dry bitterness . the pine comes across the most in this department . m-the dryness extends to the mouthfeel and it 's something i 'm not a fan of . it 's medium bodied with low carbonation . the alcohol is palpable on the way down . d- not very high , i was expecting something a little more complex . i let this warm quite a bit and i think the negative qualities ( dryness , one note flavors ) became even more obvious . i 'm actually struggling to finish this one ."

S"poured a see thru piss yellow with a finger of head that dissapated quickly and left some decent lacing on the glass . i definitely get aromas of various grains and water off the bat but also get faint malt and wheat notes . this a very thin and watery beer with grains as the dominate factor on the taste which has a little malt but that 's about it ; very bland flavor . the beer was super thin in body with a good amount of carbonation that had a grainy watery and slight crisp finish . the beer drinks very good because its so damn watery which makes for a great session beer and also a brew you can have lots of in the hot summer day . oh ... .and the only reason i 'm reviewing this beer is to gain beer style points cause i need to review a light lager ."

S"rec 'd a bottle of this unbidden in a recent trade with chickencoop . no idea there was beer even made in tibet ! i wonder what kind of 'philanthropy ' 10 % of profits are given to ? pours a watery , suspicious-looking yellow . pale . smell is grains with more grains . lhasa tastes unfortunately like an adjunct lager . dominated by a sickly sweet maltiness , accented by an all-spice shot , presumably from the saaz hops ( though what treatment they rec 'd to taste like that i 'm not sure ) . as it warms , the taste veers towards watery . after only a few ounces , my mouth is puckering like sucking on a lollipop . not good . the sweetness is n't balanced in any way by another ingredient , & lends to an all-sugar , all-the-time , experience . wo n't be able to finish this one & feel the need for hops to wash away the developing canker sores ."

S"a hearty and vigorous head forms , slowing my pour and rising just slightly over the top of the glass . it settles a bit but some half inch head remains . the body is dark orange and hazy.. i 'm fascinated as to what differentiates an imperial pilsner from say , a pilsner urquel . the nose is alot like an ale , even an ipa . it 's orangey , but beneath that is the straw/dry hay notes of a pilsner . tastes like a big mix of styles . orange peel so bitter that it becomes like licorice at the back of the tongue . it 's spicey , fresh gingerbread , very rich . i ca n't blame any beer labeled `` imperial '' for being this packed with flavor , what i must say is that i 'm a bit overwhelmed . at 8.8 % abv this would make for a short session ale . and with the amount of bitterness i ca n't imagine what could be paired with it foodwise ( i 'll have to ask beerpanther ! ) . it feels smooth and well carbonated , like before it reminds me much more of an ale , but it 's definitely a very good brew regardless . as the label states the finish is long , but it 's also clean and does n't have any overbearing aftertaste . with the abv i would say that the drinkability goes down a bit for me . enjoy in moderation ."

S"the menu says it 's `` an english style amber ale with sweet caramel malt flavors that yield to bitter hop flavors from a good dose of english hops . the nitrogen/carbon dioxide blend gives this beer a creamy head and smooth drinkability . '' it had a very good nitro head on it - thick and creamy . it smelled a bit malty . the color was amber and it was super clear . the taste was pretty good and the nitrogen head definitely added a smooth creaminess to the beer . it had a slight bit of light caramelly flavor and a slight english style hop bitterness to it . overall it was not too bad of a beer . again , i felt like it was a little light for the style , and i think i expected a little more flavor to it . it went well with my meal , and would probably go well with just about any food , as it was n't as full of flavor as i had hoped ."

S"2009 edition with vanilla beans , corriander , orange peel , nutmeg , cinnamon . this beer pours a cloudy amber color with a nice head that hangs around for a while . the orange peel and corriander come through strong in the aroma , but the other spices are still there . a touch of alcohol and very little malt or hops in the smell . the flavor is all about the spices . very spicy . the citrus components mix with the nutmeg and cinnamon to create a powerful flavor that overwhealms all other flavors . malt and hops are hidden . the alcohol is also apparent . it has a medium mouthfeel , but the way the spices coat the mouth , it makes it seem more full . the drinkability suffers here , in my opinion . there is just too much spice and too much alcohol that is n't balanced . interesting beer , but not one of my favorites . oh yeah , i did n't get any of the vanilla bean ."

'' anyway not negative in anyway . you get a solid stout consisting of strong roasted coffee that does n't bring much bitterness but making it smooth and enjoyable and mild chocolate sort of cocoa like . nothing more or less but lovely . m - even though it 8 percent it is surprisingly drinkable . yet a sipper you would enjoy . d - yeah i will pick up another four pack . founders has always been good to me and i appreciate the effort they put into beers and a nice price tag to boot makes this one beer thats a must for my fridge ."

'' love those creative minds over there at stone . yes , this is a very bitter beer and just how i like it . do n't get me wrong but there is some malt presence in the very beginning , but it is quickly washed away by grapefruit and pine flavored hops . the finish is dry with a light alcohol finish . a staple in my fridge , i love this beer . drinkability is a little on the low side , because it is pretty aggressive . i would recommend this beer for any one who is a hophead like myself , definately not the beer to convert a bmc kind of crowd ."

S"poured a dark , reddish-brown with a thin light brown head . the aroma was coffee with a hint of malts . the taste was odd , bitter , like a cup of cold coffee . after a couple tastes i kept thinking of burnt sugar . it was n't a turnoff but i did n't really enjoy the flavor . it has good texture . it is on the heavy side , but if i enjoyed the flavor i could see drinking a six pack with no problem ."

S"pours a pale straw colour with a medium white head , thins out to a ring around the top , not helped at all by weak but steady carbonation . no lacing . looks very dull . thin smell , virtually no malt . a lot of grassy hops but mostly just a soda water aroma . smells acidic , basically like carbonated water . unimpressed . the taste is revolting . it has the palate of a backwards pilsener . starts off , well , watery , while the mid-palate has bitter notes with a slight pow hoppy character , and then a thoroughly nasty lingering sweetness on the back . the flavours might be okay if the hops were at the back to truncate the sticky malt , but it 's topsy turvy and as a result leaves me syrupy and sweet . mouthfeel gets sticky at the back as well , but is not too watery , quite appropriate for the lager style . not very pleasant and not drinkable . a failure ."

S'dark brown with a slight reddish haze . the aroma is bursting with dark fruit , cherries , brown sugar , caramel , and yeasty fruity spice-dough . every dark fruit profile is covered , as is nearly every incarnation of dark sugar . the flavor loaded with dark fruit and yeast character . raisin , plum , fig and date combine with biscuit and dough to create an epic concoction . the palate is rich , thick , creamy , and pillow with a sweet smacking finish . anyone who says they like this more than the 12 is kidding themselves . a thinner , more yeast forward version of the 12 , but delicious just the same .'

S"-- -july 4th , 2006 . 2006 vintage -- - thanks coloradobobs for letting me try this rare beauty . i 've had some flanders browns before , and i enjoyed them , so i was excited to try this prime example of a related style . it is most definately tarter than the browns . it also tastes a little less like something crawled into the bottle and died . that is both good and bad . first impressions . . . from the fridge : this beer is really quite refreshing , actually . in a lot of ways , it reminds me of grolsch . . . a fairly neutral taste background with a tart , acetic ending . as it warms : vanillin and other compounds from the wood make their presence known . the tartness continues to dominate and it slowly begins to take on a slight malt-vinegar aspect . i do n't like malt-vinegar , but i do like this , which means that it is mostly lactobacillus doing the work rather than acetobacter . that 's good , i was worried it would be a drainpour . the beer itself is a beautiful red-gold with just the faintest ring of head . delicate and beautiful . as it wams some more : still a dry beer , but some of the residual sugars are starting to show . just a pinch to combat the extreme acidity . a little bit more funk starts to make its presence known , but nothing too extreme . sour cherries , with some tangerine . it reminds me of the pruno my friends and i brewed in high school . . . but good . i do n't know if that makes sense , but that 's how i feel . second glass : yeah . . . i 'm beginning to understand why this beer is so sought after . after my relatively positive experience with some guezes and jolly pumpkin , i think i 'm going to have to more seriously investigate sour beers . i only wish it were hotter outside . this would be a perfect thirst-quencher . it feins complexity , while actually being a fairly straight-forward , delicious beer . a pity it is n't more available . thanks again , coloradobobs . this is mighty tastey . -- -october 17th , 2006 . 2004 vintage -- - ahhhh , but a little age on this beer and it becomes a whole different animal . my-oh-my . first off , much of the acidic character has mellowed , as the wood character . instead what i have before me is a wonderful combination of these two flavours mixed with a large blast of sweet malt . it actually reminds me very much of rodenbach grand cru at the moment , but more complex without adding an unpleasant funkiness nor an excessive sweetness . and no old cheese , like i 'd"

S"poured a golden yellow with a huge white foamy head , excellent retention and lacing . the smell was of bananas , candi sugars , sweet and sour fruits , bubble gum ? alcohol , citrus and wheat . i was suprised and impressed . the taste was grassy and had strong sour fruit presence , somewhat disappointing after such a great aroma . alcohol , wheat and citrus rounded things out . the mouthfeel was very very bitter and sour , with mild carbonation , and otherwise pretty bland . it finished very dry . i could do a few of these before i 've had enough or swallowed my own face from the bitter sourness . in all seriouness though , this was a decent interpretation of a belgian pale ale , and i think i should really experience more of this genre before really dismissing this one ."

S"og=1.098 , 9.0 % abv . murky , dark-amber in color , forming a tall , rocky , whipped dark-beige head with awesome holding power and sticky sheets of lacing . carbonation is mild to moderate . aroma ... intense floral and piney hops , sticky amber malts , molasses cookies , faint sensation of alcohol , pumpernickel bread dough , caramelized sugar , dark honey . mouthfeel is syrupy and oily with a dense body and slick finish . taste ... as per aroma ... there is also a peculiar resinous buttery hop note towards the end with the suggestion of almonds . the hops predominate initially , creating the sensation of west-coast intensity and harshness ( i.e-centennial ) . the suggestion of ripe dark fruits does n't quite have the intensity to balance the hop levels . the alcohol is harsh and medicinal , with no fusels . as it warms , it worsens ... there is no improvement in balance , and the alcohol becomes even more dominant . this is definitely a sipper for a cold , lonely winter night as you watch the snow sadly obscure your recently shoveled driveway . this is a hearty olde ale . i have drank cellared versions of this brew and aged bottles are better , however the young batches just do n't have any balance and are harsh and medicinal . if you like west-coast offerings along the lines of stone , you will enjoy this one . this is my least favorite of the otherwise exceptional bells lineup , but still a kickass brew ."

S"750ml bottle from the may '08 brewing . the cork comes loose silently , and pouring it proves there is indeed very little carbonation , if any . the beer is surprisingly clear , with a bright copper body and some traces of a would-be foam collar . looks like a liqueur , and the similarities do n't stop there . smells incredibly sweet , with brown sugar and fruit notes . lots of orange character . very boozy ; taking a big whiff , it burns the nostrils . caramel , brown sugar , and honey in the taste , again with a good deal of fruit . there is a surprising amount of bitterness there , though it 's easily overpowered by the sweet finish . no real alcohol bite , just a very warming finish . thick feel that is quite syrupy . normally not the kind of beer that i really go for , but i think the lack of carbonation is really what lets it work . rather than thinking about this as a beer , it comes off as being much more akin to a typical dessert liqueur . definitely a sipper , and not something i want to have more than a 6oz serving of , but then again , one can just recork the bottle and not have to worry about losing carbonation . really interesting for what it is ."

S"pours black with a thin tan head , kinda what i expect from an imperial stout , when there 's just a little bit of beer left in the glass it 's a really dark red which i thought the shade was pretty cool . the head retention was pretty good , left a sticky lace down the side of my snifter coffee smell and fruit aromas , there 's a sweetness in the aroma i was n't expecting , good chocolate smells home through as well . very chocolaty up front , the alcohol is quite pronounced and the flavors of the beer do n't do much to mask it , licorice flavor is pleasant and the roasted bitterness is a nice balance to the initial sweetness the czar is heavier in body and the light carbonation gives it an almost syrupy mouthfeel , the alcohol factor inhibits it 's drinkability , the alcohol is n't unpleasant but a bit overwhelming , 1 bomber in an evening is enough for me , it started to feel like a chore as i was having my last glass , good for a glass or 2 but if i want the whe bottle i might have to lay this beer down for a year or 2"

S"another delicious bells offering . i want to thank my neighbor for this thank you for dog-watching beer . i 'm drinking it with her ( the dog ) right now ! small , off-white head with a nice amber color . looks like beer ... smells like grapefruit and hops ... or perhaps that is grapefruity hops , eh ? the taste is surprisingly hoppy without being overly bitter . this is even more true when having this on-tap . this is far too easy drinking and yet , it is so delicious . i could easily have too many , and too many would probably be two . so , it 's a good thing i am at home . if you have a chance to try this on-tap , definitely do so . in the bottle it is great but on-tap it is much different . i found it much more hop scented with less bitterness .

S"750 ml bottle courtesy of amie straight from florida - thanks for the opportunity to try this ! poured into two tulips . a : gusher ! huge , obnoxious amount of billowy slightly off-white head , even with the gentlest of pours . dark orange , way darker than i was expecting for this beer . not bad but the gusher-status of this beer is a detractor from it 's appearance . s : sweet notes of passion fruit , grape and peach . lactic tart notes come through as well , something i was n't expecting but it 's very nice and welcomed in this instance . t : tart lemon , funky and sour brett notes , oak , white grape juice . i do n't really get any guava as it seems to be masked by the overall funk character this beer has . it 's not done right , either - a rather flimsy example . m : bubbly , crisp and clean , this medium-bodied mouth feel is quite nice for the style . this seems to be another `` miss '' in cigar city 's attempts to make a funky , brett-esque beer . why on earth they are taking a would be nice , guava infused saison and putting it through their rather awful wild fermenting process is beyond me . stop doing this - and if you 're going to - refine and master the process ."

S"a- pours a nice 2 finger bright white head but this is n't your budweiser soapy foam , kiddies , this head has some retention . as the head recedes it leaves some patchy lacing . the body has some very fine sediment ( nice ! ) and has a nice dark golden color . s- there is a slightly bitter hop component , a nice floral note , and some sweet malts . not a whole lot going on , but it 's an apl . t- this beer starts out with a nice floral maltiness but as soon as that graces the palate , a nice hoppy edge joins in for the symphony . overall this is really balanced and enjoyable . the finish is dry and is extremely reminiscent of the finish of a garden carrot , slightly dry and earthy . ( i know that 's odd , btw ) m- just some light carbonation there which is enough to lightly tickle the tongue . from first sip to last this is balanced and leaps and bounds more complex that the style typically is . d- move over grainbelt , i 've just found my new session beer . this beer is extremely drinkable while also exhibiting some complexities . i 'm not sure what a 12 pack is but 13 and change comes to mind . if i want a lawnmower beer or just a light refreshing lager , this is the go-to ."

S"i 've had this several times but just have n't put up a review for it yet . vintage 2010-2011 . do have to admit that this beer gets much better with age though . pours a dark black color with a great sized tan head , fades at a slow rate , when held up to the light barely a hint of light can penetrate around the edges . smell has a nicely crafted aroma of chocolate and roasted malt , it does n't smell fake or sweet but a nice dark chocolate type aroma , touch of dark fruit in the nose as well . taste is a mix of roasted malt and chocolate malt , coffee-like bitterness , not much of a hop presence which is not surprising , the strength is very evident with a slight burn on the tongue and a warming sensation in the belly , definitely needs some time to smooth out , creaminess is decent , slight dark fruit on the sides , carbonation is spot on , full-bodied yet not cloying which is a fine line to walk . one of the best examples of a ris , right up there with old rasputin . the fact that this beer is widely available during the winter months is also quite the achievement ."

S"i must have had an old bottle in this one notched november with no year . vigorous pour into a tulip produced no head to speak of . the bubbles that did surface dissapated almost immediately . bark brown color . the smell was that of a standard stout , but with the addition of a rather metallic copper smell . ( maybe from the lactose ) i love a stout , so the taste was good to me . lactose sweetness , roastyness . there was more carbonation than i expected after the lack if head . ( i thought i had a dud ) it 's not too heavy , but it does leave a feeling in the back of your mouth like you 've just had a tall glass of milk .

S"barely any head after the pour , color is deep copper , it just looks a bit flat . smell is faint , fruity apple , mildly alcoholic . the taste is tangy sweet at first , with hints of apple , raspberry , and spices . the finish has bit of a honey-like flavor and then it dissipates into nothing . not bitter . alcohol does n't appear that strongly . some interesting fruitiness in the flavor but it does n't come together to be that enticing . the mouthfeel is a bit thin although the carbonation seems adequate on the palate . unique taste , but it still does n't make for a very drinkable beer ..."

S'very dense black beer with a slight mahogony tint when held up to the light . not much head which vanished imeadiately . a very light sweet aroma but hard to pin dowon it was so light . some roasted malt bitterness to the flavor accompanyed by a fruit ( berry ? ) sweetness . this beer was almost absoluteltey flat ( next to no carbonation ) . which is why i think i had such a hard time getting any distinct aroma or flavor . without carbonation this drinks like flat root beer .'

S"this beer had a hazy reddish amber appearance but was still fairly translucent . had a little head at first pour . once it settles , a ring of foam is retained around the edge . had a very floral and herblike aroma . what you would expect from a beer with a nugget on the label . extremely hopped but does n't linger as long as other hoppy beers do . that helps a lot with the drinkability . could definitely drink about 3 of these but then would have to move to a less extreme pale ale ."

S'12oz bottle split courtesy of viggo - cheers for the treat and the great nightcap ! no date or markings on the bottle but viggo assures me this one has a couple of years on it . pours a dark brown , burgundy , plum -ish color with not much head to speak of , pretty placid . nose is a delightful bounty of fruits - currant , blackberry , raspberry dominate . hints of raisins , caramel , and toffee . this is big and bad like a barleywine and yet , with the fruity notes , adds to the complexity and depth . raspberries , plums , hints of citrus , rich caramel , a faint hint of hops , more berries , brown sugar , bread , still some alcohol warming in the finish . such a smooth drink ( aided by light carbonation ) and yet it still has a hint of raw power after a couple years ( it is 15 % ! ) . really complex and enjoyable if yet still a touch raw . meant to blow the doors off rather than pick the lock . a terrific sipper , dessert , nightcap . great brew .'

S"wrote notes for a review at a bbq where they had this on ice . light yellow and super fizzy , the head goes away quick and leaves little lacing . smells lightly of grains and perhaps corn . it 's hardly got any taste , what there is consists of grains and adjuncts . light and well carbonated , goes down easy i 'll give it that . for the price i suppose it serves a purpose , but it 's certainly not a craft beer , nor would it have much appeal to those with a refined beer palate . a frathouse special to be sure ."

S"purchased in fl recently . i was pretty excited as i normally like the style , and terrapin has been proving itself to be a very solid brewery . no real date , but the bottle states : 2011 vintage . poured into a duvel tulip . crystal clarity to a golden brew . a nice prickly white head . no lace though . smells very yeasty . there 's no implication of hops , especially that on the order of an ipa , at all . clove and spice . is this a belgian ipa or a duvel clone ? tastes overly belgo-ified too . the listing claims this as a spring seasonal , so perhaps this bottle is now several months old , but i doubt the ipa hoppiness has completely faded in that short a time . this beer was always about the yeast , or at least , became that way . there 's a mild bitterness on the back end , but nothing that signifies an ipa base beer . the bottle does mention a tripel , and that is much more believable . spicy and quite sweet . medium bodied , with mid to low end carbonation . much boozier than the style ought to be too imo . overall this was a huge disappointment for me . this is such an invigorating style when done well ."

S"the pilsener style may be one of the more simpler styles of brew , and it is indeed the most exploited style in most parts of the world , but brooklyn brewed a version that stays true to what the style should be . of course this means that this is no wimpy watered down fizzy yellow beer but instead a beautifully golden , crisp and flavorful beverage worthy of being called a beer . as mentioned , the color of this liquid is a golden color that midas would have coveted . the head on this brew was disappointingly a bit thin ( only about 1 fingers worth ) , but it lasted a little over a minute and left some sticky lace in its wake . aroma-wise , this smells pretty standard : pale , bready pilsener malts with some hop presence in the nose . the mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly , sparking the tastebuds to life . the malt flavors seem to be the focal point of this brew . malty but at the same time nice and crisp , and quite reminicent of a german pils . the hop flavoring are very well done here . you wo n't find an overabundance of hops , but the bitter herb and woody flavors they add to the brew round out the beer nicely and add a good drying touch to the finish . the aftertaste contains some lingering notes of the biscuity malt and dryness , and concludes with no alcoholic warmth . yes , the style is simple . but simple is not synonymous with bad ( certainly not in this case ! ) . this would be a good beer to hand to a bud drinker so that they can see that there is a world of difference between their alcoholic corn and rice beverage and a 100 % all malt pils . all in all , this is a good , solid pilsener that might become a semi-regular in my fridge ."

S"i was intrigued by the style when i first spotted it on the shelf and i had a good experience with the ipa but this one leaves alot to be desired . has a very strong coffee smell upon the initial pour and that translates over your tastebuds on the fist sip . one of the disappointing issues i found is that flavour is lost upon successive drinks unless you allow some time to pass between quaffs . it also contains a strong citrus flavor in the background which i 'm attributing to the yeast strain . this brew , without the `` coffee flavouring '' , seems like it would be a formidable beer but definitely not a porter ."

S"so , an interesting sensation is one in which you are drinking a budweiser , immediately after drinking a really strong ipa and eating a piece of lindt chocolate . so , under these circumstances , this beer drinks like thick air . if i had not just clusterfucked my palate with a dp consisting of hops in front , and rich european chocolate behind , my review might read as follows : a - light light golden , clear as a nun 's conscience . s - boil a handful of rice crispies , cornflakes , in a stockpot . adjunct grains . typical . t - drinking budweiser is a little like eating fat free triscuits , with no toppings . you can eat an entire box without breaking a sweat , but you only would if you are not that interested in the experience , just the result . similarly , you could probably drink an 18 rack of these in a single sitting , assuming you were properly motivated . like , to get mega twisted , or have a pissing contest with a clydesdale , or both . m - thin and spiky d - like i said before , it probably would n't kill you to hook up an iv of this stuff and have it pumped directly into your arteries . as for putting it in your mouth , the sky is the limit , but that 's sort of the point ."

S"millennium ale is the same tone of orange as the inside of a sweet potato . the beer is beyond murky ; inspection to the light showcases a warmer , but always dreary , complexion . tiny , very glinty bubbles appear like microscopic chars of glass shattering in slow-motion . they sparkle just like diamonds and this twinkling adds some much needed , highly aesthetic and easily distracting decor to the otherwise somber appearance . this beer has some pretty impressive specs : it contains twice as much honey as malt and over 3lbs of hops per barrel with an additional half pound more of whole-leaf hops used to dry-hop . evidence of these elements is had in the aroma , an experiment in juxtaposition , where the silky sweet nectar of honey fuses with the resinous and bitter pungency of the hops . both scents share a distinctively floral and earthy tinge ; they work well together . if the beer really does contain twice as much honey as malt ( which , quite frankly , seems a stretch ) then what i 'm drinking should taste an awful lot like honey , no ? perhaps even twice as much like honey than beer ? well , it 's not exactly that ratio but it does taste like honey - the sweet , flowery , nectar-like flavour is mild but unmistakable . it seems an awfully good honey , with a smack of citrus , it is almost certainly wild . the other part of the flavour , the minority of it although not by much , is an equally sweet malt bill that has been boiled to well beyond the point of caramelization . remnants of the hops can also be found ; traces of earthy , floral greens are never too far away . although its alcohol does n't really show and the beer drinks mighty fine as is , i think an extra dosage of malt could have been spared for a thicker , more full mouthfeel . the bottling date on this 2008 vintage has already passed its year-and-a-half anniversary but the beer seems to have held up . ( fun fact : honey never goes bad ! ) still , it 's not something i 'd recommend for long term storage . flavours are delicate and there does n't seem to be enough malt or hops to make me confident in its chances for long haul survival . its total lack of carbonation is more persuasion to be happy for cracking it open tonight . many believe honey is a natural health remedy - well this is certainly good for what ale 's ya ! ( hearty har har ) but seriously , the floral , earthy character of honey is an ideal accompaniment to similar qualities in the hops as well as the syrupy sweetness of the malts . the folks at dominion brewed a nice little beer to celebrate their 1000th"

S"12 oz bottle a : clear light amber under a small unremarkable white head . no lacing , decent retention . s : big on spice , small on hops or malt . seems like they may have accidentally dropped a pumpkin ale into the bottle . a lot of allspice . t : yep , harpoon could bottle this next year and call it a pumpkin ale and no one would be any wiser . again , big on spice , small on hops and malt . but the hop character is actually noticable in the taste , unfortunately it does n't accent the spice very well . it 's a slightly earthy hoppiness and there is even the slightest hint of alcohol somehow at 5.5 % . m/d : carbonation is a little high but does n't throw things off too much . body is lighter then it should be and comes off watery . drinkability is n't too bad but it ai n't that great either , same goes with the beer overall . this might be passable as a pumpkin ale ."

S"from a 650 ml brown bottle , vintage 2006 . abv listed as 8 % . pours out a light impermeable pitch black , with a deep tan spongy/creamy head that retains to a fair sized cap . sticky , coral reef-like lacing . a rich , vinuous nose on this imperial stout , with rich roasted malt , dates , figs , blackstrap molasses , and some sharp notes of alcohol . a touch briney , similar to soy sauce . quite the whammy on the first sip , the palate is overwhelmed and the alcohol content goes straight to my head , as if it 's splitting up into two to take me over -- one to distract and confuse me , and the other party to go straight to the control center . fortunately by the third sip the paranoia passes , and the flavour becomes more comprehensible . massive chewy malt in the beginning , although dry as well , probably from a combination of the roasted malt and the alcohol . fig newtons with a dash of soy sauce in the middle , along with a combination of raisins , rum and brown sugar . some leather as well . the finish becomes more rounded yet just as bold , with dark chocolate and turkish coffee , very dry and quite bitter . that dry coffee grounds character lingers on well into the aftertaste . smooth mouthfeel , with a creamy medium bodied texture , not as thin and runny as other imperial stouts can come across . i have to admit though , i 'm really wrestling down this stout , this king of the sea is n't necessarily all that accomodating and friendly . in fact i keep glancing out of my peripheral vision for captain ahab to come along and help me out with it . definitely a slow sipper of an ale , and best to share the bottle of this size with another willing party . i was happy to see this on the shelves here locally , but i ca n't really fathom going back for another one , not after the struggle it 's taking to polish this one off . a good example of the bigger beers getting too big for their britches and less palatable as a result ."

S"found a bomber at zipp 's last night for $ 2.99 , thought we 'd give it a shot . hard pour into a wine glass . 2 inch light brown had , leaving a decent cap and thin streaks of lace . black , no light penetration . aroma is muted , faint traces of roasted malt , orange rind and coffee . a good swirl does n't do much , but let it warm and that seems too help . first sip starts out mediocre , but again , let this warm and give it some to to roam around your palette and it really warms up . oats , bitter roasted grains providing both chocolate and coffee , more rind/ zested orange , hops that present with some aspirin and more roasted malts that finish pretty bitter . its never really sweet , but it definatly dry 's out through the finish . i had doubt 's on this beer based on the price but its actually quite flavorful . it does n't seem to follow the style well though . its much more of a black epa/ pale ale . it also is a tad husky and that is fairly nagging . overall glad i tried it , but mislabeled for the style . if your looking for a porter you may want to move along ."

S"i have had this on tap before a couple times at a local bar and this is the first time from the bottle . my conclusion is that it was far better from the tap unless this is a bad bottle which i doubt since it came to me from a friend bringing back from the brewery . 12oz bottle poured into a flying fish tulip glass . bottle graphics : 4/10 . bit annoying . a : peach colored body with the slightest white head . the lacing was touch and go but where it stuck it stuck . s : here in the aroma , the hops make the appearance . citrus , lacking pine . it smells extremely sweet in the style of a wheatwine or barleywine . t : super sweet , has the honey sweetness of hopslam but not the balance of the citrusy hops and plethora of other flavors . it began sweet and ended sweet , not a favorite . too much for a dipa , much closer to other styles where the hops only real spotlight is in the resiny mouthfeel . s : creamy and lush . sticky from the resin and for a dipa , this has a great feel through the swallow and sitting in the mouth . d : given the alcohol level , it is drinkable . more than the booze , the sweetness can be burdensome . this pushes the boundary of an ipa family beer , mostly because of the huge sweetness . odd point here in that this is a rare beer where it actually tastes better real cold- maybe thats why i liked it on tap more . they sell the major series in nips now and this would be good for that because it would n't warm down ."

S"i feel like there should be an additional option for lost abbey beers in the `` serving type '' arena . it should also add : `` bottled ( 2009 version ) . cause way too many of these beers are uncarbonated . here is my original review : ___ pours a dark black , with a deep brown ring on the top and a dark tan head that quickly , quickly settles down into the merest crust . not much carbonation . mouthfeel is thick and chewy : one of the thicker beers i can recall sampling . perfect for this style . a very strong smelling beer , this one hits you with bourbon , oak , some dark roasted fruits/chocolate and ... rum/molasses ? interesting to say the least . the taste is explosive . at first i was disappointed this was n't a 750 ml bottle , but you do n't need more than this size . gigantic bourbon/oak flavors , huge chocolate overtones ( not much coffee ... strangely ) , and i swear there is some rum or molasses mixed with roasted cherries or currants in here . i could be wrong , this is a very complex stout . it is so different in character from old viscosity i would n't believe it was based on it . this is a difficult beer to properly review . the taste/flavor is so strong and particular , i could n't see myself sitting down and ordering this for all occasions . but , you seldom see this kind of amazing robust flavor from any beverage , and it should be treasured for that . **one last thing : there is no way this is only 12 % alcohol . ___ i gave it a 4.4 , with a 5 for flavor . well , what am i giving it now ? the beer i poured last night was utterly flat , and with such a heavy , heavy beer , it needed some carbonation . just some . so much of the complexity was lost , and it just became a flat , heavy sitting sipper . i guess i 'll round the scores ."

S"i do n't think i 've ever had such a disparity between my scores from category to category . poured a dark brown , which with a little light behind it reveals a dark amber base . the head is dense and lasting like chocolate mousse . smell contains a hint of honey but the prevailing scent is unsmoked tobacco . this literally smells just like open pouch of red man ( which has a element of sweetness in it 's scent too ) . the honey asserts itself more in the taste , as is a hop bitterness but there is still a ton of leaf tobacco . mouthfeel is exactly what i would want from a porter . not so drinkable for me - ca n't get past the tobacco . very interesting , unusual brew but not for me ."

S"had on tap at winking lizard for their 2010 christmas in july celebration . i was not aware that the beer was actually retired ... i hope i was not served old beer , however if this had been sitting around since last winter it could explain a lot . appearance was black as oil but thin with a two-finger tall head of light caramel color . it took several minutes for the head to recede to a point where i was not drinking mostly head in each sip . smells of very strong molasses . there is also definitely cinnamon and ginger in there as well . taste is of even stronger molasses flavor than in the smell . if they did n't brew this with molasses then i should never review a beer again , it is very thick and syrupy tasting . i taste slight ginger and nutmeg and a little orange peel . the other predominant flavor is cinnamon hiding just beneath the malt profile . as far as mouthfeel goes , the beer was thin , almost flat , although the flavor of the various ingredients was thick and oily . i found this to be a very interesting beer , one which would likely only be better fresh and during the christmas season . however it was not very drinkable in my book , i found myself struggling to finish the pint ( and i love molasses ) . maybe if paired with a molasses or gingerbread cookie it 'd be easier to stomach . all in all i can see why it was retired , though there is a chance i was served 8 month old beer . i give left hand props for pushing the envelope , because all of their other beers are so well balanced and restrained . keep experimenting - i 'd be happy to try the new holiday replacement !"

S'poured from a corked and caged 750ml bomber . bottled in 2009 . poured into a stone levitation goblet . presentation - great looking bottle and artwork . invites you to pick up a bottle or two . appearance - dark red / maroon body with at least three fingers of a strong tan head . retains nicely leaving a decent lace . smell - one word ... raisins . there seems to be some fig or plum as well . taste - a malty brew here . raisins definitely make an appearance . very sweet up front and finishes off dry . feel - rich and full bodied . a little carbonation . being a quad , the relatively high abv makes its presence known . drinkability - a good quad but i always find my self limiting myself at one bottle ( or even splitting it ) . final thoughts - again this is a good quad ( especially from the us ) , but not the best . lost abbey has better brews as well .'

S"pours a deep ruby with a two inch head with some serious staying power . great lacing and retention . smells mildly sweet , with a hint of milk chocolate and fresh ground black pepper . taste is grainy , chocolatey , sweet juicy caramel malt with a slight white pepper , and starts off nice but the more i drink it the more i get hot peppers and hot peppers and more hot peppers and boy is it peppery . i like eating spicy food with a cold beer to cool me down , but i 've never drank a beer before that made me wish i was drinking another beer with it just to cool me down until now . as for drinkablilty , i like a lot of spicy foods that are traditionally spicy ( wasabi is like crack to me , and i could eat a vindaloo for breakfast ) but i do n't like making food hot for the sake of making it hot ( i ca n't stand hot peppers on a burger or spicy hummus , for instance ) and this beer kind of falls into the latter category for me . it 's heat that does n't belong . heat for heat 's sake . i can certainly see how this beer might appeal to pepperheads who like their mouth to burn like molten lava no matter what they consume , because , underneath the heat are some really nice malt flavors . too bad the pepper all but completely stomps them out ."

S"i like the odd notion series , usually some good flavors and styles are pumped out.. this one , not so much . just another tasteless , light bodied wheat-type ale to me . the ginger is barely noticeable , not that its an overpowering flavor to begin with , and this just turns out to be a watery blonde-ale . not harsh in any means and definitely drinkable , but to me it 's akin to a bud light wheat . like most of your stuff magic hat , more than most people , but this one is 'meh ' for me ."

S"2010 version . 12.7 % abv . poured from a 22 oz . bottle into a snifter a thick , black liquid with a slightly bubbly chocolate milk-colored head . did not leave much lacing down the glass . could have been because of the amount of time it took me to finish this ultimate sipper . initial ( and somewhat overpowering ) aroma is of molasses . after i cleared my snoot , i gave it another more gentle sniff and this time picked up the molasses ( of course ) but also vanilla , cocoa , and maple . the flavor , like the aroma , is dominated by the molasses . however , the flavor is more complex than even the aroma . here i get not only the molasses but also tobacco , dried fruit , vanilla , maple ( especially on the tip of the tongue ) and , strangely , mint . but it 's a bit more hot than i 'd like . it 's really boozy . this is silky smooth with just the right amount of carbonation to hold up all these flavors . not sure it could be better . the molasses becomes too much after a while and gets cloying in the end . i did let this get rather warm . maybe if i drank it a bit cooler , i 'd do better . this is to be shared ."

S"this is great lakes ' 20th anniversary beer , a souped up limited-edition version of their popular dortmunder gold . poured into a large pilsener glass , with enough room for the entire bottle of beer plus a nice head of around 2 inches -- literally to the brim . i drank this about a week ago , so i 'm going by memory , but i hope this is as accurate as possible to my actual experience . it did so many things right , i just had to review it . appearance : beautiful . simply one of the absolute best looking lagers i 've ever seen . from the insanely attractive dark gold with lively carbonation bubbles dazzling in the light , to the crystal-clear body to the thick , foamy , smooth white head ... this can easily make any other lager i 've seen turn its head , and even many ales . its color is similar to dortmunder gold , but quite a bit darker with a more amber/brown tinge to it ; in my opinion , much more appealing visually . i could go on and on , but really ... it has to be seen to be believed . downright amazing . aroma : nothing special . i seem to recall somewhat strong bready and malty smells , and some fresh biscuits . nothing offensive , but at the same time , nothing great . at least it *has* a smell ... and a decent one at that . something a lot of other beers ca n't brag about ( yet , for commercial reasons , they often do ... ) . taste : there 's something to the taste about this beer that i just do n't like . it 's got a strong maltiness that reminded me somewhat of a malt liquor , and of course the bready and biscuity flavors as i seem to recall show through as well . and boy do they show through ; those two flavors seemed to dominate , making for a disappointment in the taste department . also , it quickly deteriorates in flavor as it warms up just a bit , as the already-dominating maltiness and bread gets even stronger . i think the biggest downfall to the taste of this beer is probably its seeming lack of balance compared to its big brother , dortmunder gold . maybe some more hops would go a long way . it 's puzzling to me , because i 'm more of a malty kind of guy . mouthfeel : quite good for a lager . this beer actually had some feeling to it , which is more than i can say about so many other lagers . in fact , i would say it had just about the perfect mouthfeel , not too watery , not too thick . just right . drinkability : according to the excellent mouthfeel , you would think this"

S"i would suggest that , contrary to what i 've read about this beer , that this beer has more than a hint of smoke , although this is definitely not the smokiest beer i 've had ( that would be the aecht schlenkerla rauchbier marzen ) . to my palate , this beer tastes meaty , which is not entirely a bad thing but does make the beer a bit less drinkable than some other styles . this beer tasted a bit like summer sausage , in contrast to the rauchbier marzen by this same brewer which tasted very bacon-y . definitely worth a try , but not something you 're going to drink more than one of ! also , if there was ever a thread on this site for `` worst lawnmower beer , '' this might be in contention . oddly ( at least to me ) is that this beer really does look lager-like . it is golden with nice amounts of head . aroma is very smokey . mouthfeel is actually fairly pleasant . recommended ."

S"i 'm always excited to try dfh 's unique offerings , so i was pretty excited when i found this at whole foods . a- red and white pours light reddish gold , with a small amount of head . pours pretty thick for a wit . s- smells like a wit with everything the label promises . spices , orange , grapes , a little bit of oak . the alcohol is noticeable in the smell as well . t- unfortunately this is where this beer goes downhill for me . after the first sip the first thing i thought was `` boozy and cloying '' . as i moved through the beer , the alcohol was noticeable much more in some sips than others , but when it was noticeable it was boozy and unpleasant as opposed to warming in my opinion . red and white is sweet to the point of being cloying for me . usually i do n't have a problem with sweet beers but this one was over the top . the wine like flavor from the grapes was interesting , and the hints of oak were nice as well , but these aspects that work well take a backseat and are overshadowed by the sweet booziness . m- syrupy , coating the inside of the mouth and throat . very noticeable 10 % abv . d- i split the bottle two ways with a friend . honestly , i could have split it 6 or 7 ways and still have had enough of this beer . overall this one misses the mark with me , but i am left with no lower of an opinion of dfh because of it . i love the unique beers that they offer and the fact that they are constantly pushing the envelope when it comes to styles . with so many `` off centered ales '' in their lineup , of course there are going to be a few that i do n't like . in my mind they make up for it though every time they blow me away with something unique and different that i have n't tried before . so , overall even though i did n't like it i am glad i tried red and white , and i wo n't hesitate to continue buying from dfh ."

S"beer from 2008 , drank in 2010 first words that came to mind , in order , after the first sip : roasty , dry , oxydized , low carbonation , low head this is a dark beer with low carbonation and minimal head . almost no head retention . there was a lot of sediment at the bottom of the bottle , and i did not manage to prevent all of it from getting into my glass . please keep that in mind when reading my review , as the beer might have been better with a better pour . the mouthfeel has a slightly viscous feel and there 's a boozy smell to the beer when i bring the glass up to my nose . the roasty character of the beer is quite strong , stronger than what i am used to for a barleywine . i feel like i am drinking a barleywine blended with a stout . even has a stout 's smell . a roasty , thin , `` wet '' smell . it 's an enjoyable beer . that said , and while agreeing that memory can be tricky , i remember liking it much more with only one year on it . this bottle seems not to have aged so well . i wonder if the screw cap has anything to do with it ? there is def . some oxidized notes to the brew . it feels flatter than what i remember drinking last year . that brew was smoother , richer , more buttery . this one seems dry , roasty and flat , both in terms of depth and carbonation . some bitterness left , but none or little hop aroma . there 's a big winter warmer feel to this beer . the alcohol is quite strong and can creep up on you . i am not a lightweight , but tonight i am feeling the effects of alcohol after most of the glass . still enjoying the beer , but really feels like a very roasty old ale rather than a barleywine when aged . as it warms it tastes better..and as a drinker you are more likely to enjoy it when you get a bit drunk from it . as an old ale , it 's neither terrible or great , but as a barleywine it 's past its prime . it 's still on the shelves here and i could pick up some more when i see it . maybe with 3-4 years on it , it will become an excellent old ale . but at the same price point , there 's better old ales available and there 's better barleywines as well , and i would recommend seeking those out first ."

S"served in a duvel tulip at a few degrees over fridge temperature . this is known to be a different take on the belgian pale ale theme , with more hops than most . looking forward to the tasting , as i have had this bottle waiting patiently for months . appearance- a medium yellow/gold with almost total clarity . the 3/4 '' rocky head that adorned the top has faded rather quickly to a rim with sporadic , cloudy wisps . not much lacing to speak of . smell- i 'm not sure what the dominant aroma is here , but it is offensive . right off the pour , it became evident that something crazy is happening . pungent , rotting oranges and garbage is the best way to describe it . not funk , but spoiled food . rank . taste- okay , i now see why this is considered the hoppiest beer of belgium . it is definitely complex , and very interesting . nothing like the smell suggests , the hops are heavy-handed as they overwhelm the palate with floral , grassy , dry characteristics . the adventure begins with a musty , nasty intro that makes way for the eventual dry mouth-puckering bitterness . it 's interesting to note that the finish is very familiar , like a pilsner urquell in its simplicity ... yet the trek is fresh , new , but dangerous ... this beer is not for everybody . mouthfeel/drinkability- light to medium weight , pretty average ... a slight prickle at the front of the tongue that breeds softly over the whole . alcohol is evident only by sensation and not by taste , as a mild warming and tingle comes forth . i wo n't be visiting this one again , although i 'm appreciative for the tasting . a beer like no other , for sure ."

S"this beer is not what i expected , but reading the commercial description makes my perceptions make a lot more sense . to me , `` porter '' usually means lots of dark malt roastiness ; and `` english '' usually means `` boring '' ( see any `` english style ipa '' for more on this topic ) . this beer i thought was contaminated - it had this weird tangy sourness that to me seemed to be the by-product of either brettanomyces infection ( or some other infection ) or at the very least some heavy belgian influence . the story of original porters being `` soured '' rings true - from a history of beer in england i once read . having read this description , the beer i drank seems like it landed on-target ( assuming the description was written before the beer was made ! ) . it is brown , it has a nice head , it has a slightly roasty , somewhat sweet , and dominantly sour nature ... so much so , i ca n't imagine that the original porters were this sour . still , for american craft beer geeks who love all things sour and funky , this is a very interesting interpretation of a porter . and while i ca n't say i 'll be seeking it out again because i found it to be not too drinkable and while very interesting not all that enjoyable , i can say that i am enriched for having tried it . i bought a bottle of this as a 12oz single from riley 's wines of the world in madison , wi ."

S"poured a deep golden color ( like honey ) with attractive white creamy head . smell is minimal with a slight sweetness noted . taste is also slightly sweet . i really co n't detect any honey flavors , just a pleasant sweetness . finishes with a suprising dryness that balances the malt nicely . a nice easy drinking beer . would be better on a hot summer afternoon ."

S"drank from a 12 fl . oz . bottle purchased at martignetti 's liquors , boston , ma poured a translucent black with only faint hints of brown noticeable on the fringes of the glass . the one-and-a-half finger , creamy , caramel colored head faded to a thick film and lasted throughout the beverage . some spotty lacing along the glass . smell was malty rich with strong notes of coffee , cocoa and a hint of vanilla . taste was initially malty sweet and creamy up front ( for a millisecond ) before the intense , deep , roasted malts inundated the palate . bakers chocolate came out mid-palate . the back end was espresso-like and surprisingly hoppy . the lasting aftertaste was also espresso-like , dry and bitter to the extreme . mouthfeel was super rich and creamy . drinkability was average . while there were some interesting flavors in this beer , i felt that they were flattened and overshadowed by the intense bitterness ."

S'half of a 12 oz bottle split with my lovely girlfriend . huge creamy vanilla head sitting atop crystal clear orange body . looks pretty good . intense hops in the nose , grapefruit and other sweet citrus with some light hints of pine in the background . wow , juiciest of juicy hops sting the tastebuds and white grapes and oranges round out the experience . initially clean , then halfway through the hops hit you , then drive right into a dead end road of white grapes , oranges , tangerines , and grapefruit . little to no malt being tasted . a little thinner than i like for the style . carbonation is just right though . the hops in this one are juicy and sweet with very little bitterness at all . day in and day out this beer could keep me satisfied . this is a world class iipa that hardly gets the respect it deserves .'

S'poured from the bottle to a nice golden orange with floating sediment and a medium thick off-white head that lingered well and left good lacing . nose of hoppy fruit ( apples ) along with cinnamon spices . mouthfeel was tingly and spicy , and the flavor was a pleasant mix of the spices and fruits . as the beer warmed at mid-glass , the 9 % alcohol worked its way into both the aroma and the flavor , just enough to add an extra kick . finally , the finish was long and warming , with just a hint of bitter . though not meant as such , this would make a good winter warmer .'

S"it does n't take a beer geek to recognize excellence . i had this beer once on tap one upon a springtime in seattle , on my first visit to the stumbling monk . i 'd never heard of pliny at the time but since it was the strongest ipa on tap i requested it . the bartender did n't really play it up , so i was amazed when i got the beer in front of me . the luminous golden cup in front of me bore a heady , floral aroma of citrus and conifer . i remember really tasting the grapefruit in it , and being impressed by both its richness and balance . after a beer this strong i would n't usually feel like another one , but this was an exception . i knew at the time that it was easily the best beer i 'd ever had , and i have n't found a better one since . the holy grail of ipas ."

S"i 've never seen lenny bruce perform . from what i 've read , he was ahead of his time , pushing the boundaries of what was thought to be good taste in his time , and never afraid to take risks or possibly `` '' step over the line '' . in that spirit comes bittersweet lenny ripa on rye from he'brew . unfortunately , like a comedian who simply swears too much and uses shock value of profanity to make up for poor punch lines , this brew simply did n't have the proper level of restraint , nuance , and balance to work for me . i started by pouring it into my tulip , and appreciated the dark brown liquid with a slight head of white foam floating on top . there was lots of sheeting action on the glass . i have a weak nose , but could n't pick up much aroma for all the strong flavors i was about to encounter , a little hop aroma , a little malt aroma , not much else . the flavor was strong , the flavor was aggressive , the flavor was a little shocking , and unfortunately , the flavor was not all that enjoyable . there was a lot of malt in there , with a bitter rye note , that seemed to overwhelm a lot of piney , grapefruity hops . i was surprised to see the malt overwhelm the hops is what the bottle said was a double ipa . now there is nothing wrong with breaking the rules , but if you 're going to break them , something good should come out of it . that did n't happen here . with all that malt , the mouthfeel was one of the high points of this brew , with a luxerious , creamy texture . but i found this too strong , aggressive and unbalanced to be very drinkable . i can appreciate what he'brew was trying to accomplish here , but these type of beers work not because of the aggressive flavors , but because care is taken to balance and blend the aggressive flavors , and that is missing here ."

S'pours a dark but crystal-clear amber color with some copperish hues . the brief head is followed by a very slight lace , and even that doesnt last too long . the sweet aroma features strong notes of fruit ( raisins ) and spicy alcohol . the powerful taste of this brew includes somewhat sugary raisins , light rum and sweet caramel . of course , there is a fairly sharp alcohol bite , but because of the strong maltiness , its more subdued than one might suspect given the 14 % abv on the label . the syrupy mouthfeel is just about as full-bodied as it gets with some pretty mild carbonation . definitely a classic though not a typical dopplebock , more like an example of just how strong that style can get . nevertheless , a real treat and , while far from a session beer , something every serious craft beer lover should try . highly recommended .'

( a very fair price imo ) i could see this being a nice after dinner beer or something that you could pair with an equally complex cigar ."

S"from notes 10-2-08 eye : very dark brown in color , ca n't see any highlights in this beer , no light seems able to pass through it . head is tan in color , creamy in texture and has great retention and formation qualities . an oddity that i can see is that some yeast from the bottom of the bottle is suspended in the middle of the glass . i 'm not talking about small particles , that seems quite normal to me . these are a few larger chunks that have yet to settle . in my previous expereince all others where yeast has made it in has sunk within the time that it has taken me to dictate aroma and eye , this one however seems to be content just lingering in purgatory ... right in the middle of my glass . i find it odd that the yeast did n't break up when poured , no haze , just a few large chunks , not a flaw but quite interesting as this is the first time i 've ever seen this . lacing is quite nice , leaving sheets and rings . nose : very potent aroma , before the glass is even close to my nose i can smell , tons of dark malt-chocolaty mainly and some roasted grain . alcohol jumps out too . on closer inspection , with my nose in the glass : oak , vanilla , bourbon . the first three words that came to mind . the aroma really reminds me quite a bit like the goose island bourbon county stout- in the aspect of the dark malts . hints of coconut . at first what was so potent is now weaker , harder to detect . tongue : odd flavor here , my first thoughts are medicinal and grape . kinda reminds me of grape cough syrup . i do n't know why , maybe its just the odd concoction of flavor and alcohol that does it but i 'm not going to be able to get past that now . its especially noticable in the aftertaste-whilst being swallowed and after . it is n't bad , but if you ask me the taste is much too thin , not much substance to it . some chocolate in there , but really the flavor of this beer , the taste seems much too watery . after drinking the 10 i was hoping for much of the same intracacy and complexity , but alas not here . disappointing . i 'm not really looking forward to finishing this one ... but i will . mouthfeel and drinkability : overall thin and watery if you ask me . anything coming from belgium should be much heartier . this is one that i 'll not ever buy again , i 'm glad i did n't waste money on a four-pack of this , i 'm glad that i received this as"

S'drunk directly to the brewpub . beer with a blonde strong colour , clear and clean , with a creamy white foam , but not so particularly compact . in the nose is immediately evident a good hopping , with clear scents of newly mown hay . this fresh hopping still fits well in the malty structure that you can perceived in the background . even in the mouth the bitter and dry hopping ( still hay ) stands clear . obviously bitter in the mouth persists for a long time , cleaning perfectly the palate and allows to drink large quantities of beer without any problems . definitely a good beer . dangerously drinkable and thirst-quenching as a respectable pils should be .'

S"750 ml bottle , served at room temperature to celebrate the new year . now , to be fair , i 'll give anything a fighting chance , but this is one beer that i could not finish . it was awful , i dumped it out after a few sips . with style in mind , i do like fruit beers , magic hat # 9 and long trail blackberry wheat come to mind as examples of beers where fruit is used properly . but this tasted like a bad wine/beer mix . poured a very pleasant ruby red , very clear , with no head at all . but i did like the way it looked , sort of like red wine . smelled like cherry cough syrup with a bit of spice mixed in . bitter and overly sweet at the same time . not good , and certainly nothing beer like about it . tastes downright gross . overly powering flavor of cherries , mixed with a sour aftertaste , with a faint note of alcohol . once i choked down a sip , i noticed that while very uncarbonated , it did go down smooth . very thin , and slightly oily . but the taste prevented me from diving right in . after a few sips , i had enough . not at all what i was expecting . this is hardly a beer , and i dislike wine . i gave this beer a fair chance , but it went down the drain . when it comes to fruit flavors in a beer , less is more ( same goes for samuel adams cranberry lambic ) ."

S"picked up a '1pt , 9.4 fl.oz . ' swing-top bottle ( c'mon , just say '750 ml ' ! ) on a recent stop at market of choice , west linn . cbp 's bottling concept is to mark the labels 'dollar deposit ' ( vs. the typical 5 deposit here in oregon ) and to include a lengthy disclaimer about how returning/reusing the bottle instead of recycling saves as much energy as what it would take to power a 60-watt light bulb for a week ... interesting ; every little bit helps . the end result is still a bottle priced under $ 5 , so a pretty good deal regardless . 6.7 % alc . by volume , vegan ( unfiltered , unpasteurized , no finings used ) about the name : i looked up on wikipedia what 'miskatonic ' meant and found that it 's a fictional university created in the 1920 's , the setting for a number of stories by writer h.p . lovecraft . presumably this would explain the cryptic phrase at the bottom of the label : `` ph'nglui mglw'nafh cthulhu r'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn '' . a : gorgeous pour after a loud opening 'thwup ' ... be careful - it 's not a gusher , but does offer a *huge* pillowy head . the lightest-colored ivory cream , the first glass yielded over 4-fingers of rocky , sticky seafoam , the second just over 2-fingers . beer is a brackish chestnut , the finest silty suspension . a few streams of the tiniest carbonation wriggle to that everlasting crown . a superb head on a fairly ugly murkiness gets a '4 ' . s : dark bread , moderately toasted and a hint of sourness . very dry , dusty almost , like ground grain . the mildest spices and hints at berry fruit and grape skins . t : husky grains , full of dark and very bitter maltiness , then an odd tartness ( that may or may not be fully intended , though i trust the freshness of where i bought this ) . the first review nailed a 'black tea ' character that i found right away , but could n't put my finger on until after posting my review then editing - it 's herbal and grassy , lemony in the end . kinda weird , yet kinda interesting . m : a little crisp at first , mellower carbonation later . the tartness lends a somewhat 'quenching ' appeal , and the dryness ends decently enough . medium body . d : well , based on a brewer 's description of 'dunkelweizen brewed with rye instead of wheat ' i guess i expected only a moderate departure from the maltier/fruitier sweetness of a traditional dunkel . the end result here is tough to categorize : much drier and with a bitter tang ; it 's questionable what the intent was . i do n't think"

S"typical pilsner appearance . straw hue and perfectly clear . lemony and floral hop nose perhaps from tettanger . malt notes are surpsingly absent in the aroma . light in carbonation for a pilsner . hop bitterness is mild and malt sweetness thus dominates . lemon zest hop flavor followed by a hint of graininess . nothing outstanding in flavor , but the lack of flaws and clean finish to this beer make it innocuous and drinkable . it 's not a beer to savor by itself ... it needs greasy food ."

S"i 'm sure that nobody knows in us , but lowenbrau is also brewed in russia in st.petersburg by bravo international co . there are bottle ( 50 cl euro-bottle ) and 50 cl can variants , and also draught . blue label with a freshness date and a notice of reinheitsgebot ( german purity law ) . but in fact the name of the beer in russia ( and in germany too ) is lowenbrau original ( not premium lager ) . take a look : http : //www.loewenbraeu.com/3_products/3_2_product_range/index.htm abv = 5,2 % , gravity may be 11,5 % or 12 % . in germany original gravity is 11,8 % . color of the body is light yellow , beer has a good head and very high carbonation . smell and taste are very clean and round : vivid malt and light hop bitterness . there is some sweet aftertaste , but it goes well . very good impression ..."

S"a- i poured this into my mug and was greeted with a thick , frothy , tan colored head that retains fairly well , eventually settling down to a thick layer covering the beer . the color of the brew is dark brown with reddish hues and is clear . i can not see how much carbonation there is . the lacing is good , leaving sticky fine bubbles on the side of the mug . s- bittersweet chocolate and some roasted malts characterize the aroma upfront . it becomes sweeter , with rich dark fruit , but also some banana , and some toffee/molasses . t- quite sweet , again with the chocolate and caramel/toffee creaminess . it is also somewhat fruity , with the subtle banana flavor that 's noticeable in the aroma . the hop bitterness is mild but does linger on the palate if left alone for a minute . i also taste some sticky honey on my mouth afterwards , and a slightly coffee flavor could be blended in there as well . overall , a good even flavor profile . m- buttery and a nice medium body is what this beer contains . the carbonation is mild and the bubbles are fine , allowing the full flavor to come through without providing that zing on the palate that comes with so many lagers . the alcohol is well hidden , allowing the grainy sweetness to be in the forefront . d- as i find with most euro beers , this is another great one ! i would like to try the other products by lubkowicz . this one is clean but full flavored and i 'd very much enjoy this as a session beer . i think it borders close to a desert beer and would like to try it with a meal as well . i recommend this beer !"

S'2004 bottle . appearance amber-brown , but not leaning toward the red end of the spectrum , this barleywine has a 1 finger yellowy-tan head . it has quite remarkable head retention for its high alcohol content . there is no real lacing to speak of though . smell a whole lot is going on this the nose : some very fresh , mildly roasted malt smells , which i enjoy so much , abound as well as super citrusy , orangy smells . taste caramelly , sugary with very little bitterness , nor alcohol coming across . extraordinarily light for a barleywine . leaving it on the palate for longer than ten seconds reveals amazing sourness with still no bitterness . the sourness comes across after the medium-long finish . mouthfeel a little slick and extraordinarily light-bodied for such a strong and alcoholic brew . drinkability this is a dangerously drinkable beer . there is almost no indication of its 9.2 % abv . for better or worse , one could knock these back all night . its not what i expect from a barleywine , but its enjoyable .'

S"this one poured a cloudy yellow with hints of orange and a ton of floating sediment . a white head was left behind with lacing here and there . the nose has a lot of spices ( peppercorn , coriander ) and citrus peel . there 's some pineapple in the mix , along with wheat malt . the flavor is definitely citrus ( lemon and grapefruit ) , citrus peel , and spices up front , especially the coriander . there 's even a slight hint of coconut in there , i 've picked this up in other wits . this is a medium bodied wit , definitely heavier than the average . this is for sure the most complex and flavorful witbier i 've had ... . but not necessarily the best . it 's drinkability suffers where other wits do not . it is due to the overload of spices ; it 's not necessarily bad at first , but you 're ready to move on after a couple . still , it gets props for standing out from the rest . great brew ."

S'easily my favorite double ipa . this is a highly complex beer that is well served by the addition of honey . it pours an deep orange color with a floral aroma coming out of the thick head . the taste is all citrus , grass , and herbal hops . the honey is barely perceptible but definitely rounds out the taste . i would give this a perfect score but its drinkability is limited by its high abv and me having to travel out of illinois to get it .'

S"a - copper/burnt amber color that 's a little cloudy bit a bit of head . s - overly sweet cherry smell and sugar , wrapped in a lot of bourbon . lots of wood and vanilla . t - this tastes like an overly sweet cherry beer with a dollup of brandy and a lot of vanilla and wood . while quite flavorful , it is much too sweet for my liking and a bit sugary . m - very sugary and thick , a lot of carbonation . d - too sweet to the point of hard to drink . not horrible , but the overt sweetness made it hard to get through my four ounce pour ."

S"served from tap into a sampler tumbler . poured red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a very minimal amount slowly . maintained decent lacing throughout the glass . this is where it went downhill ... . the aroma was comprised of sweet malt , nutmeg , and burnt hair ( wtf ! ? ! ? ! ? ) . the flavor was of burnt malt , nutmeg , and the taste of how burnt hair smells ( omg ! ) . it had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation . overall holy christ this was bad ... it was just not appealing in any aspect . burnt hair ... really ! ? ! ? if i 'm honest i would n't drink this again if it gave me a ruby everytime i took a sip . just not worth it . however i might keep this in mind for when i want to play a cruel joke on a not-so-good friend ."

S"i had this for free after my final soccer game in milwaukee this weekend and boy was it nice ! poured an amber color that was clear and transparent with a medium sized creamy off-white head . i noticed quite a mixture of malts and hops in the aroma but nothing i could really distinguish . at first sip i immediately noticed toasted vienna malts come alive . strong flavor there . the bitter hops followed that toasted malt flavor . after that more malty flavors showed which included biscuit , caramel , and some light fruit taste . finishes with some more hop kick . this is quite nice and very thick for an amber . i would want to drink these all night , but i do n't know if i could ."

S"had this served up at the sam adams joint in the cincinatti , kentucky airport in between germany and atlanta . they only had four or five beers , and i had already had everything but the venerable sam adams light . serving was from an ice-cold bottle poured into a pint glass . appearance was a medium amber color with a small white cap that left minimal lacing on the glass . nose a mix of vague grain and herbal hop notes , but nothing spectacular . taste is somewhat bland , with a thin malt background balanced by a deal of hop bitterness . body is medium-thin , with a decent amount of carbonation . finish is a short-lasting , semi-dry bitterness that mellows into a sweetness as it dies . overall , the beer is what it is -- just a better-tasting , more balanced version of a light beer . if ever i was forced to drink a light beer , i 'd definitely choose this over any of the macro water beer , but it 's certainly no replacement for a fuller beer ."

S"as someone who nearly vomited upon first tasting a rauchbier , i am quite happy i eventually got over all that . pours an off-white head that sizzles and settles on top of a ruby-tinted amber/copper brown . a little lace is left in the liquid 's wake . aroma is , unsurprisingly , dominated by smoke . has a mesquite charcoal smokiness . makes me think of glowing coals and bbq . the smokiness veils any other aromas that might 've tried to penetrate . oh wow . flavor-wise this is one of the best smoked beers i 've ever had , in any category . the depth of flavor is immense , revolving around a complex smokiness that indicates the brewer did n't use just any old crappy wood when smoking the malt . woody , earthy , dense , hazy , rich , round ... the smoke dominates , but there 's an apple-ish layer coming through , giving the right amount of light , sweet balance to an otherwise hearty , heavy brew . superb flavor . i mean : superb . as awesome as the flavor is , this is more demanding and left-of-center than your everyday beer , hurting the drinkability somewhat . but it still this comes highly recommended . hooked up with this beer thanks to msubulldog25 . much respect flyin ' out to b to tha g ."

S"not a scotch ale in the least -- a bird of an entirely different color ... but likeable . the single malt , is oddly pleasing , i must say -- and that 's a compliment , especially coming from a man who needs his hops far before he needs malt . aroma is of faint banana , with , dare i say it , a very , very faint horse blanket passing breeze . flavoring hops are pretty much non existant , but the finish is drying , so there 's some bittering in here ( according to the label , fuggles ) . i 'm not usually an appriciator of more malty creations , but i like this . it 's definately sippable , and the maris makes for a distinct flavor . i would purchase this occasionally if it were sold in sixers ."

S"served in a shaker pint glass at old chicago . the guy next to me at the bar told me to try this one , so i decided to accept his suggestion . it pours a hazy pale-ish straw topped by a finger of light cream foam . the nose comprises wheat , light bubblegum , banana , light pepper , and lemon zest . the taste holds notes of sharp citrus peel , clove , pepper , wheat , sourdough , light dry honey , banana ( peel and all ) , cedar , and walnuts . honestly , this concoction does not sit on my tongue nicely at all . the body is a heavy-feeling light ( i told you it did n't sit on my tongue well , right ? ) , with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel . overall , i really did not enjoy this beer . the seemingly off flavors , when mixed and striking my 'buds , really do n't endear the beer to me at all ."

S"i tried this beer as a recomendation from a friend . poured into a pint glass . poured into a dark dark brown color with a small head . the wood overpowered the smell . hints of vanilla and mocha can be picked up as well . again the wood overpowers the taste . all i tasted was wood . it was tasty the first couple gulps but after that it was just too much , it was n't even fun to drink after a while . has a med . to med . full mouthfeel . i was not impressed with the drinkability as it was just wood tasting for me . at the price this sells for i would not recomend this to a friend ."

S"received in a trade with cpetrone84 ... first time trying the fat dog ; neck of bottle says `` bottled on 3/11/09 '' pours a dark , dark brown into my new belgium globe . a two-finger frothy tan head quickly forms before settling to a small thin moonscape cap . not as dark as most imperials , but then again , i ca n't really say i 've had a lot of `` imperial oatmeal stouts . '' appears a bit less dense than what i am used to as well . moderate lacing early on , but with the head nearly gone it disappears midway down . smell is primarily composed of semi-sweet chocolate and a small bit of coffee . also a bit of raw grain . had to retake my first drink on this one ... i had let it sit out for about 10 to 15 minutes and had in my mind what i thought it was going to taste like . on my first pull however , i received a phantom ... just a whisper of some roasted malts . after several drinks , however , i realize that there really is n't a lot of up front taste with this guy . sweet roasted malts grab me first with semi-sweet chocolate that finishes it off . only a very small amount of alcohol present as far as i can tell - even after it warms up a bit . mouthfeel is very thin for the style and low carbonation - disappears quickly . i seemed to get a much different flavor profile than most other reviewers . i will definitely try a second bottle of this to see if i 'm just a bit off tonight or what ; i was underwhelmed by this beer . consumed : 2/2/2010"

S"i bought a bomber of goose bump at jb 's food and bottleworks ( $ 5.49 ) . poured in to a pint glass . pours a black walnut color and is opaque . one finger bubbly tan head dissipates quickly leaving little lace . smell is a rum candy and coffee aroma . caramel and toffee notes are also present . taste is decidedly a rich dark roasted coffee flavor . bit of a caramel and spiced rum sweetness . mouthfeel is full bodied , even thick , but not particularly cloying . a bit of alcohol heat on the tongue and the back of the throat . drinkable for the style , but at 9 % abv not particularly sessionable . i 'm not sure it 's worth what i paid , well worth the price at say $ 3 or $ 4 a bottle ."

S"750ml split with the bro . opaque black . creamy and creeping coffee colored head with good retention . phenolic in the nose with a chaos of spice characters that borderline overwhelming with hints of pine . smooth and creamy , with an tangy , somewhat acrid , roastiness upfront . coffee , some light molasses , chocolate , with some burnt raisins in the back . bitterness melds with the tanginess and offers a leafy feel on the palate . spices steal the show , unfortantely , with a very strange pine sap character and a mess of flavors from what appears to be an overuse . dry finish , slightly smoky in the linger , with a residual powdery spice and malt dusting . had high hopes for this one , and it was good in places , but ultimately i was let down . there 's just too much going on and absolutely no balance which leads to a beer that 's virtually undrinkable ; hardly enjoyable . tastes like it was n't meant to be released yet ; unfinished and rough ."

S"bear with my first review here on beer advocate , but i just had to share my experience with this exquisite brew from the soon-to-be snow-covered and desolate upstate new york ( it 's october now ) . i am a big fan of middle ages beers , and this particular brew is one of the reasons why . it does n't have much of a head and it 's nearly impossible to drink quickly , but that 's where its shortcomings stop . like all barleywines , druid fluid has high alcohol content ( 9.5 % ) , but like all good barleywines the flavor of alcohol does n't overpower the brew . instead , you taste a sweet , but bitter , and perhaps a little dry flavor you would expect form some dry wine . the carbonation is subtle yet perceptable , as if it were bottle conditioned . a good combination for such an expensive beer . the beer appears a brownish-red or reddish brown poured in this here wine glass ( it is time for me to get a real goblet ) ."

S"on tap in a shaker pint ( which quite frankly was about 8-10 ounces to much ) . see-thru orange with a finger 's worth of creamy head initially . this mostly fades away fairly quickly , but leaves some scattered lacing here and there . the only aroma suggesting this is a beer is a hint of graininess . otherwise , it smells remarkably like a creamsickle . thickish , syrupy and excruciatingly sweet . some citric hops and husky grain flounder in a sea of marshmellow fluff and orange hard candy . i realize the honey the feature ingredient here , but this is overkill . at home it would have been a drainpour ; at the bar , i left 2/3 of it untouched . strong recommendation to avoid ( unless you 're a fan of underattenuated messes like creme brulee and dark lord ; in that case , this may be a treat for you ) ."

S'dark brown and opaque . lets very little light through . tannish head of over a 1/2 an inch and with good duration . laces in complicated and shiny little strings . bright aroma for a porter , some molasses but with a leafy hop quality . mouthfeel is lightish , carbonation about medium . flavor follows aroma to start -- some coffee and a hint of chocolate but with a solid sense of citrusy hoppiness coming through as well . in a way , its refreshing and easy to drink with its light body and its got a nice and atypical hop/malt balance . not as malty and smooth as some porters run toward , though warming improves those qualities .'

S'after the success of fest and the quick sell-out i bought a case of narragansett porter without having tried it first . luckily i had some trusted opinion on it before i committed , but it was well worth it . the porter comes out of the can with a silky slick pour . the liquid has a syrupy appearance and a dark brown hue . the head is a frothy brown with great retention and produces nice lacing even as it recedes . the nose is heavy on espresso and chocolate . the roasty malts provide a nicely balanced sweet toffee aroma . the flavor is full-bodied and carries a biting smokiness . the roasted malts are delicious and provide for tons of flavor . brown sugar and molasses sweeten up the beer a bit , but the hop profile and smoke keep it in check . the mouthfeel is light overall . its certainly not as robust as many other porters , but that makes for excellent drinkability .'

S'this beer is a rusty medium amber and an ordinary pour yields a quite extraordinary amount of foam that ended up filling the top third of a pint glass . the head was parchment in color and had nice staying power , leaving equally nice lace . this really is a lovely looking beer . the aroma , however , is not so lovely . orange citrus hops are present , but predominantly i am getting caramel malt and some funky esters . the flavor is not nearly as hoppy as one would hope in an ipa . orange , pine and spicy herbal hops are there , but once again , the somewhat caramelized malt seems to be the main player here . there is also a flavor that reminds me of unfermented wort or malt extract and is not appealing at all . it does not taste like an infection , but it also does not taste good either . this beer also has a pretty sever bitterness that is a bit bracing . the body is medium , but perhaps a little on the thick side for a single ipa . the finish is bitter and a bit sticky , but not terrible . this beer does not leave me with the desire to drink another one .'

S"grabbed this not too long ago at discount liquors in milwaukee . did n't know exactly when to pop this ugly mutha , but tonight seemed like as good a night as any with it being one of the last beers in my fridge . a- poured without any pomp or frilly technique into a brandy snifter . generates about a finger 's worth of head the dissipates to a pond scum and poofed up collar . giant bubbles and microscopic bubbles make up the edge , with not an average bubble in sight . a few islands of carbonation are seen erupting from the crimson liquid . it is very reminiscent of vials of blood taken at your favorite physician 's office . lacing around the edges is solid . it never wavers , generates the same type after every drink . lace curtains along the glass , really . s- you could smell the cherries the moment you pried that cap off . it has a very mild tart aroma to it that you expect from cherries , but the predominant member of this bouquet is cherry syrup . it reminds me instantly of a jar of maraschino cherries with some hints of sour . it dominates the airspace , and leaves no room for any typical stout molecules to come forth and be discovered . t- opens up like a vanilla sundae with cherries slathered all over it . it has that sharp cherry flavor that you associate with tart fruits , but instantly perks itself up to be extremely sweet . it would be nauseating if another layer did n't reveal itself right away . lactose sugars and oak ! there is this lovely milk flavor that makes me think this beer should really be called cherry vanilla ice cream . the oak is the middle flavor after the milk flavors die down , not necessarily unique , but defining . for a finish there is a second wind of cherry . this time it is mostly an acidic and tart characteristic with a nice scoop of wood , oak to be precise . m- it has a medium body . sort of creamy , sort of just thick . cleans up well for the most part . lingers on the tongue and no where else . carbonation does n't detract , but benefits with some crisp elements towards the middle . d- the sweet nature does begin to overwhelm towards the middle of the glass . it is n't enough to be complex by the 8th or 9th ounce . it almost lasted a full bottle . otherwise this was one hell of a shocker . i never expected the oak to come out so strong or there to be lactose flavors . worked out really well ."

S"a : pours a very clear ( almost pilsner like ) light gold color . it had a huge frothy white head a couple fingers thick . the frothy head leaves a bit of lacing as it is consumed . a very nice looking beer . s : a citrus aroma seems to dominate the nose . the classic barnyard aroma seems to be present but not as present as it is in its cousins from europe . with that said , i kind of prefer the citrus aroma to the wet hay barnyard type aroma . t : is this a saison or a wild ale ? it is a lot more sour than i expected . maybe the original saisons were more similar to this one with the wild fermentation , but i have yet to develop a palette for the sour beers . with that said , i still kind of like the taste with the citrusy flavors . its just something i would have to learn to enjoy on a regular basis . m : the spicing and carbonation make it pretty aggressive in the mouth . it is a bit thin in body . due to the sourness , i did n't really enjoy rolling it on my tongue . d : assuming you like aggressively carbonated sour beers this one would get high marks here . too bad i do not care much for that ."

S'this beer is expensive but its as far as i know a one off so its to be expected . excellent beer is cheaper than sub par wine so i have no complaints especially since i drink bottle of beer at a time . a- pours nice . the fizziness tells me its not going to be a thick brew but thats ok if it tastes good . s- mmm chocolate . not much complexity here but what it does smell of smells delicious . d- as far as taste goes this beer is delicious , yet again not complex but very chocolate and the low alcohol is completely hidden , so id have to say the low abv works in its favor m- thin not exactly watery but still thinner than i would like in a flavorful beer . d- i could drink this until the floor came up and smacked in the face . i love chocolate beer that really tastes like chocolate . not a beer for everyday drinking but on a speacial occasion id be happy to break this beer ou with fine belgian truffles'

S"extremely clear and just barely colored slightly yellow . large fizzy head but it dissipated quite quickly and left little lacing . smelled ok , a bit sweet with some corn perhaps . taste was reasonably poor , just barely having flavor at all , and what there was had a tiny bit of malt and some notable adjuncts . fizzy and light bodied , pretty easy to drink albeit without much actual taste . overall i 'd recommend it for frat boys on a desert island , but not for craft beer enthusiasts ."

S"another pumpkin beeer brewed for the 2007 pumpkin fest at the brewery . i thought i was really going to like this one and that it would definitely work- but the beer just went awry . sounds better than it is . it 's a jack daniel 's barrel aged scotch pumpkin ale brewed with maris otter pale , crystal 77 , munich , and cara-hell malts . hopped with styrian goldings . pumpkin was added to the mash , kettle , and fermenter . fermented with wyeast # 1728 scotttish ale yeast and aged in a first-use jack daniel 's barrel for one month . starting gravity of 17.3 degrees plato . pours a nice dark chestnut with a tinge of orange . so far , so good . the smell is almost all jack daniel 's with a touch of orange . the taste almost made me retch- it tasted exactly like a jack and coke- where the coke line was out of whack and mixing too much soda syrup into the mix . sweet , carbonated , very jack tasting with some light citrus notes and some harsh oak on the finish . i 've always hated that drink , so for me- yuck . if you like that sorta thing , you 'll probably still find it too sweet and out of balance . mouthfeel is sweet , sticky , and creamy on the finish . could n't drink this . i think a month is too little time to age this beer , and the first-use barrel way overpowers the beer . oh well , you win some you lose some . i love this brewery 's sense of experimentation and addventure and i 'm perfectly happy trying the ocassional bomb when 90 % of what they produce is great ."

S"22 oz bottle poured into a pilsner glass . look : clear yellow body with a three finger , white head with some decent retention and good lacing . smell : floral hop character , pale malt and not a whole lot else . taste : follows the nose with a bit of dough and bread , spicy , floral hops and nothing else . simple , as a good pilsner is . feel : crisply carbonated , light to medium in body , the alcohol is hidden well but 7 % for a pilsner seems a bit high and probably does n't help this one as a sessionable beer . overall : my overall impression is that this is a decent pilsner and if you did n't know it was 7 % , it could probably sneak up on you . imperializing pilsners does n't seem like the best idea to me , but to each his own . pilsner is n't really my favorite style , anyway . still , its decent and worth a try . cheers !"

S"a : dark amber color ; not much head s : sweet , bready , caramel t : although billed as a doppelbock you might find that this beer gets inspiration from barleywine-style ales ( though lighter in alcohol than they tend to be ) ; bitter with dominant high notes m : thick , smooth , bubbly ; i 've had few that feel so nice definitely worth drinking"

S"a beer that screams 'meh ' to me . muted gold color with a seemingly decent head that quickly collapses down to a sporadically chunky coating that somehow manages to leave pretty decent lacing . smells ... chaotic , but not powerful enough to achieve chaos . smells mildly disorderly . i get lame hops and somehow alcohol considering the low abv . does n't smell good enough to dig further . somewhat redeemed in taste . peppery hops , fair malt balance . something odd that fits between alcohol and medicinal . feels decent enough , but nothing to write home about . enough drinkability to finish off a 500ml bottle . would n't spend money on another bottle , although i have a strange feeling this would be pretty decent on tap . not sure why ."

S"12 oz . bottle with an old fashioned label of a little red antique bike . around the picture of the bike is a vine of hop buds . this label has a wealth of information . besides having the government warning and refund values , it has a lengthy paragraph on how the beer 's name came about , flavor notes , abv % , correct glassware , proper serving temperature , a best before date , and even a batch number . they packed everything you would want to know about this beer onto this little label . this amber ale poured a ... well it poured an amber color . what else would it be ? there was some orange in there as well , but that did n't subtract from it 's solid amber color . it had an average less than 1/2 an inch white head of foam sitting on top of it . this head of foam actually had pretty good retention that left behind a skim of white foam and a streak or two of lace around the glass . the smell coming from this beer was simple and light with some lightly toasted caramel malts , a speck of juicy fruits , and a small touch of peppery hops at the end . it was an average amber aroma . nothing more . the taste was also plain and simple , but at least it had some flavor to it . the taste was nice and toasty with toasted caramel malts , a hint of bitter hops , and a slight touch of yeast at the finish . i had a couple of bottles of this and the only thing that changed in the taste was the level of toasted caramel malts and yeast . it was a very consistent beer . this was clearly a light bodied beer that was high on the carbonation , but had a decent aftertaste of toasted caramel malts and a tiny touch of bitter hops . it was a very easy drinking beer . in the end , fat tire makes a nice choice for a crossover beer . it contained more flavor than a regualr macro , but it did n't have an overwhelming amount of flavor to it . if you 're looking for a session/crossover beer for somebody who wants to get into craft beers , then pick up a six pack of this beer ."

S"got growler on 7/3 and took thb advice to fill up before the holiday . a - beautiful transparent gold with white lacing that slides down the glass as the beer disapears . s - given the style of beer i was n't expecting a hop bomb so i was pleasantly surprised by the grassy and herbal nose . not overpowering by any means but its their . there is also perhaps a hint of alcohol but it may also be the hops playing tricks on me . t - the grassy hops hit first and the bitterness lingers through til the end . nice malt back especially as it warms but the hops are the main character in this beer . very nicely done . m - nice light carbonation and smooth . feels like a 7 % abv ipa should taste on tap . d - this is a great beer on a hot muggy day like today . the hops are present but not overpowering . the growler will be gonge soon and refilled with masala overall another nice offering from thb . i opted to take this home vs masala and i 'm not disappointed at all . i 'm usually not a fan of english pale ales but the bitterness in this keeps me satisfied ."

S"had another sam adams , honey porter looked interesting though , with little head and barely see through appearence , i knew what i was going to sample . nose was really vague , and yet , good coffee , sweet malt and the honey made itself known . nice and appetizing . mouth turned foul though , almost like a bitter cheap beer , but saved itself on the bitterness and the slight coffee aftertaste . well , this was a disappointment . in all respects , it tasted like a sweet , cheap beer . the honey was a distraction from the porter which i 'd say was as average as yuengling 's but when you add the honey sweetness , it really detracted . not going to get this again . tasted like a sugary yuengling , and i like the y ! i do n't like this ."

S'overall an outstanding scottish ale ; this coming from someone who normally turns her nose up at the style . old chub is irresistible . deep in body and devious in color this muddy brew seems menacing at the least . nose is smoky and sweet like mesquite . malt character is overwhelming , little to no hops detectable . upon sipping an overpowering cognac molasses sweetness takes charge . smokiness exudes from the brews center as fig and brown sugar coat the palate . hops taint the aftertaste slightly , a distant floral quality . a delectable sipping beer .'

S"live review . poured from the 750ml blue bottle that i bought at save-on tobacco & beverage in mentor , ohio a few weeks ago for $ 10.99 into my orval goblet . no observed `` best by '' date . a medium brown creamy head over an almost completely black body that i can see only a trace of deep , dark mahogany color in front of direct light . i really like this look which is not all that common for beers of this style . 4.5 s distant chocolate , maybe some coffee but certainly a nice , soft smelling dark roast malt ( not the harshness of an ris but an approachable soft , coffee-with-cream dark roast malt smell ) . i am compelled to report that this smell reminds me of founders breakfast stout , only more smooth and approachable . to constrast the two beers , the smell of this beer is more distant than the , by comparison , pungeant fbs smell . 4.0 t/m looks like i hit the smell right on the head in my description because this is like founder 's breakfast stout younger sibling . coffee , distant chocolate and dark roast malt abound in this robust porter whose smell may have been softer ( to me ) than a stout but the taste is a lot closer to a stout than the smell suggested . this is a challenging porter full of huge tastes and a lingering dark roast malt robustness . the taste , in my opinion is at least good , but it actually comes across much heavier , bigger and more harsh to my taste buds than i would have liked . 4.0 d due to the bigness , the harshness and the stated 8.2 % abv i have to say that this is not a particularly drinkable beer . unfortunately the average example of this style can be quite drinkable so i will have to mark my score lower when compared to other examples of the style . 2.5 notes : i was attracted by the bottle and i do appreciate a completely opaque bottle ( lets no light in ) . it simply has to be more expensive to produce such a bottle and i appreciate that . i recommend this beer but just beware that it is much more harsh than many beers within its style ."

S"disclaimer : i am a bit biased against `` old fart '' beers such as this . not because they are currently `` cool '' due to the fact they are retro or because of nostalgia or anything , but because they fill a niche for me . that niche being that they are cheap and easy to drink . also i drink these at a temp of 40 degress f or less , as they should be consumed , imo . appearance : poors from the can into a pilsner glass a typical macro . clear , gold , with plenty of little bubbles dancing in the glass . big , foamy white head that falls to a patchwork covering . spots of lacing as the beer is consumed . smell : a touch sweet . a hint of some grain and adjunct . hop aromas not present . taste : for a macro this one does have a little bit of sweetness to it . someone who i shared an `` oly '' with mentioned the beers slogan , `` it 's the water '' and remarked , they have to say that because that 's all this is . mouthfeel : light , crisp , lively with no aftertastes . drinkability : drinkable , sessionable , poundable , affordable . it 's an able beer ."

S"pours a beautiful clear amber with a one finger off-white head that retained not too well and left a bit of lacing on the glass and in the beer . smell is intense , even when i popped the cap off this one pine and citrus was immediately recognizable . in the glass , pineapple is the strongest fruit , with some mango in there too , combined they kind of form that jackfruit smell which i find quite distinct . piny hops are also really strong here , and while there is a bit of a caramel malt in the background , this basically is hops through and through , with pine present throughout . a bitter rush pervades the mouth upon first sip , with citrus of mango and pineapple really strong , along with a bit of peach . malt comes in late , with some honey sweetness to balance the hops , but really this beer is all about the hops and pine . finishes a bit more bitter than other dipas of similar strength , but is plenty clean and very drinkable for the 10.4 % abv . get this while you can . update : after having the whole bomber ( my roommate did n't find it to his taste ) at the very end it was like having pinesol , it was so piny . got ta downgrade the drinkability , but then again , who the hell is going to have a whole bomber of this anyways ."

S"this beer pours nearly completly black with a small head that recedes to a medium ring around the surface . the aroma is of chocolate , coffee , and malts . the taste is of coffee and chocolate with some light roasted malts underneath . the mouthfeel is carbonated with a small amount of smoothness and leaves a medium bitter aftertaste in the back of the throat . overall this is a good offering from rogue . it is a great `` anytime '' beer and is worth a try ."

S"clear chestnut with a dark tan head composed of fine bubbles . not much lacing stuck to the glass from the thin cap of foam , but the head retention was pretty good . mild malty aroma with some chocolate and a quick flash of citrusy hops . balanced bitterness with some caramel and toffee , fruity hops , a bit of chocolate and sour cherries . there was a light tartness throughout . medium bodied with moderate carbonation and some dryness from the dark grain . this is a decent beer , but it lacks the depth of maltiness that i expect from a top-notch barleywine . perhaps if the brewer did n't advertise it as a bw , i 'd be able to score it higher . as it is , i liked it but think it misses the style by quite a bit ."

S"a - more of a really dark red than anything resembling a stout . you could call brown , but it 's definitely not black . cap of tan foam on top that looks like it has a bit of staying power . it 's a nice looking beer , but i would n't have guessed a stout . s - wow . huge amounts of cherry from the start . they have a bit of a fresh smell to them , but at the same time there 's a definite cough syrup aroma . t - i 'm not sure what to say . this tastes nothing like a stout . what it does taste like is someone bulldozing cherries into my tongue . it 's delicious . lots of cherry sweetness backed by what i 'm guessing is acetic acid , which provides a slight burning on the back of the throat . as it warms a little more malt sweetness comes through , but i 'm not getting any roasted barley . mf - on the thinner side with pretty ample carbonation . finishes on the dry side . it would n't match up with a regular american stout , but it does match up with what this beer actually is . d - a bit more malt complexity would have gone a long way . it seems like ng wanted to emphasize the cherry , but they did it at the expense of the stout part of the flavor profile . also , some more malt to offset some of the cherry would have probably added to drinkability . as it is , it 's good alone and would probably be great with dessert , but i ca n't imagine having more than one ."

S"got this at my local old chicago of all places . no complaints from me as it was fresh tasting . poured a medium to deep brown with a pretty aggressive head depending on your pour . smells very much like the dunkels i had in germany . malty , bready , but still very clean . tastes sweet and bready up-front , then the cocoa really comes out in the middle . a little hops to keep things from being overly sweet and a very clean finish that leaves you ready for more . not super-bold like some examples ( augustiner , ayinger , etc . ) but still pretty tasty . texture 's light and designed for consumption of several at a time . not bad at all . i could n't care less about the organic nature of the beer , but it 's nice that it did n't take anything away either . mnster might not be anywhere near bavaria , but this is tasty and very reminiscent of the dunkels from in and around munich . grab it if you like the style or german lagers as a whole ."

S"this beer rubbed me the wrong way right off the bat . i pulled it out of the fridge and saw that it said to serve at 45 degrees on the bottle , so i let it sit out for a bit . in the mean time , i had another beer , so i know my fridge is n't too cold . anyway , when i went to open this beer , as soon as the seal was broken ( before i could even pry off the cap ) foam and beer shot out . the rest of the 5 minute pour was a cycle of pour for 2 seconds , wait for foam to subside , and try again . i feel like this may have been over carbonated or something . either way , not too happy . a - pours into a pint glass with 5 fingers of foamy , marshmellowy head that leaves great lacing as it subsides . the body is as black as i 'd expect a stout to be , but whereas i 'm used to ruby tones on the edges , this beer had a brown trim . opaque with visible carbonation on the walls of my glass . s - cherry and chocolate smells are obvious on this beer . slightly offputting funkiness though . really not sure if it 's supposed to be like that . maybe that 's what caused my fiasco . t - ugh ! the funkiness is n't just in the smell . i feel like the cherry influence was taken a bit too far . extremely sweet . not enough of the coffee or chocolate bitterness that a stout needs . this might as well have been a cherry lager . lingering sweetness . mf - light bodied . slightly on the watery side . carbonation thicken it up a bit . d - no . sorry but this beer is a task to finish ."

S'a - it pours an exceptionally brassy shade of gold , with fluffy off-white head abounding and some minor lace as well . s - my first impression is that this is either strangely hopped , or the malt interacts unusually with the hop profile . it seems a bit earthy and catty , in addition to the expected sappy pine and citrus aromas . t - the gustatory is much like the olfactory ; it strikes me as an unusual dynamic between hop profile and malt . the beer is quite full-flavored , and heavy on an earthy-leafy-resiny bitterness . powerful stuff , flavor-wise , and it has big body to back the bitterness . m - ipa . heavy-duty . good . d - this is a monster of an ipa . and most of the heavy-handedness is on-point .'

S"this is my first beer from louisiana , so what better an occasion to drink it than while cooking up a gumbo ? pours a deep brown with red highlights , and a finger of off-white head , which left a few streaks of lacing as it dropped to a film . a bit more lace and retention would be ideal , but this is still a decent looking dunkel . aroma of dry grains mixing in with brown sugar , cocoa powder , raisin and pepper hits all the right notes , and promises a nice drinking experience . sadly , the flavour does n't quite live up to the hope given by the aroma , and everything seems toned down and light . dusty flavour , with cocoa and dry grains forming the base , and with a lightly sweet caramel adding some depth and dunkel character . some fruit comes through along with some light roast , before a crisp , slightly spicy finish . bitterness is very restrained . medium-light body with medium carbonation makes this eminently quaffable and good for the heat . this is a passable session brew , but there 's not really enough of interest going on for it to be more than a one-off purchase . it reminded me a lot of the middle of the road dark lagers that we brew locally , and beyond the first sixer i never returned to them , so i expect the same would be true if i was cooling my heals in new orleans . i 'd recommend it as a good cross-over beer for people who are making their first steps away from bland sameness , but nothing beyond that . thanks to bigbry for a taste of the south !"

S"sour oak and brown sugar . pretty darn bad smelling stuff over all . oak , pears , some sugar and some different scotch . wow ... oak and well harvest ale . there 's a peaty alcohol flavor here , but it 's just off . almost a butter scotch , woody flavor . for something aged in scotch barrels , there 's really almost no alcohol flavor here what so ever . some sour notes are just barely in there as well ( a part i suppose of the oak ) . the mouth feel is exceptional , but unlike the others this is n't drinkable . the flavors do n't make this something you want to drink . the rest is right but it does n't do it . this is an amazingly complex beer . i do n't know that i like the flavor but something this complex ... .it 's very enjoyable ."

S'leftover from weekend visitors . crystal clear filtered yellow color . decent white head and some actual lacing on the glass ! foam fades slowly compared to most macros as well . not a bad looking beer . in a word - creamed corn smell . sweet , slightly metallic nose to it . no hops and no yeast scent . champagne of beer , eh ? i can see some similarities ... highly carbonated , sweet and full of adjuncts ... my guess is corn . not a horrible tasting beverage , just not very beer-like . cheap , smooth and somewhat crisp . what else would one expect ? drinkable ... but barely .'

S"the best part 's the appearance - it 's beautiful . the consistency and mouth-feel are also top-notch per the style , but this one 's got me pretty overwhelmed by a mad flavorlanche . if stone gave us arrogant bastard ale , this one must be pissed-off porter . talk about a dark , smoky , estertastic bully slapping my girly mouth . i ca n't imagine drinking more than one . i 'm in no way objecting to the quality of this brew , though . the ingredients are there , the brewing 's there - it 's just a pumped up version of the style that 's not my thing . anyway , extra credit for being from my hometown of san diego !"

S"12oz bottle ( vintage08aa ) poured into a portsmouth goblet . received in a trade with beerlovingrl - thanks chrissy ! a - pours an oily black , totally opaque with a thin , fizzy , soda-like head that disappears immediately . a few straggling bubbles around the edges is all that remains . s - deeply roasted aromas , strong coffee , dark chocolate , burnt aromas . smells really good and inviting . t - coffee , licorice , and really dark chocolate . a little bit of astringency comes thru and some alcohol flavor present too . m - very smooth and oily . carbonation is low - just enough to know it 's there , but does n't interfere . d - very smooth beer . lots of rich flavors . if it was n't for the astringency , this would be a really easy drinker . just that little bit of pucker it gives holds it back for me . but overall , a very good beer ."

S"at first glance , it appears to be another expensive rogue 750ml ceramic bottle , but it 's instead an expensive red paint coated 750ml bottle . on the front it has a vertical `` rogue '' with two skull and crossbones at the top . at the bottom is the vintage year and abv % . this is the first year of this beer , so it should read 2008 . the back of the bottle has the mandatory us information , ingredients , the beer 's specifications , and two pictures that indicate what type of food this beer goes with . there is a picture of a pig and a campfire . that means it goes well with pork and bbq . so i guess the perfect food match with this beer would be a pulled pork bbq sandwich . appearance : they classified this beer as a doppelbock on here , so i poured this beer into a celebrator pilsner glass . out the red coated bottle comes a beer that was a clear amber color with a small tint of pure gold blended in with it . on top of this amber brew was a nice 3/4 of an inch head of white foam . this head of foam had decent retention that left behind a string of white rings and a few spotty streaks of white lace . not the best doppelbock appearance , but not all that bad either . smell : the aroma was light to mild . there was n't much going on in the aroma department . even swirling around does n't do anything to increase the aroma . the aroma was lightly malty with toasted caramel malts , a drop of molasses , and then it suddenly finishes up with crispy floral hops . like i said before , there was n't much going on in here . average at best ! taste : the taste was almost the same as the aroma , except the hop profile in the taste was a tab bit stronger . that means the taste was light to mild and lightly toasted with toasted caramel malts , a hint of molasses , a touch of grapefruit and pine , and then ends up on the bitter side with crispy cascade hops . there really was n't anything special about the taste . it was a little bit above average . if it 's truly a doppelbock , then it 's on the lower end of the of the doppelbock style . mouthfeel : this 9 % abv rogue beer was light to medium bodied with crispy carbonation and with a hoppy and slightly malty aftertaste of toasted caramel malts , a splash of grapefruit , a hint of pine needles , and crispy floral hops . the hoppy aspect of the aftertaste stood around for a few minutes , but the matly aspect came and went . drinkability : there 's a couple"

S"1997 bottle , purchased september 2003 , consumed almost immediately thereafter ... appearance : dark as sin , pitch black , with not a bit of foam above , not a touch of froth , just random brown bubbles about the sides . aroma : the alcohol wafts into the atmosphere and is quite powerful before the glass comes anywhere near my nose , and from this distance i note : maple syrup , couch syrup , port wine , licorice . so , bring it closer ! ... ooooh ! wicked ! an intense mommajamma ! it ca n't be a beer ! sherry + jagermeisters+ meyer 's , shaken well , with prune juice , lit on fire ! ... then dipped in turpentine ! smells like the sweeter extracts of the sulphur pits of hell ! so , now to taste : no , this is really pushing it ! goes beyond anything recognized as beer , anywhere ... no , it 's closer to port , and should be consumed as such . thick on the tongue at first , then mild , still with a sweet , treacly coating that trickles down the throat . definitely not a bock , not even a doppel , nothing like one , and i want to call it a barleywine , but it 's not that , either ... slowly , the booze kicks in ... raisiny , datish , leaving a lace on the glass like you 'd find in a wortchestershire bottle ... i 'd like to see them do a commercial for this one ! `` always a good idea !

S"the stargazer is one of karl 's best , but still a sad excuse for an ipa . poured a golden/orange color with a thin off-white head . light lacing and moderate carbonation . served too cold . i tasted decent , light malt character with a hoppy finish but it was rather week and watered down . this might work for a regular macro drinker but i need a little more flavor with my ipa 's . cheers !"

S'good beer overall . pours a very pale almost white yellow color with very faint fizzy head that goes away before it builds up . no lace no white rim nothing . it sits in the glass looking almost lifeless with some slight bubbles rising to the top of the glass . aroma was typical of a white , coriandr/clove scents with bready aromas and slight citrus peel . nothing jumped out but it was clean and blended in the aroma taste was very delicate , nothign hit you , it was very nice blend of the flavors and as i said delicate yet as lifeless as it appeard it tingled and fizzed a bit in my mouth . very refreshing . very drinlable and refreshing , clean , delicate and very slightly crisp . personally i would not pay the $ 10 for 6 again but its still a nice beer .'

S"coming from the cleveland area , the great lakes brewery , and especially the christmas ale are as much of cleveland lure as chief wahoo and the dawg pound . appearance : served from a 12 oz . bottle , into a pint glass . the beer is dark copper color , and comes with a thin but lasting head . smell : the strong smell of cinnamon greets the nose like the smell christmas cookies pouring out of the kitchen on christmas morn . taste : the smell only contributes to the exceptional taste . i remember first tasting a christmas ale a few years back and literally jumping out of my seat . maybe it 's because it was truly one of the first micrbrews i came to taste and was not ready for the sensational trip my taste buds would go through . cinnamon is the most dominating taste , with the ginger finding its way through . however , i have a hard time noticing the honey in the ale . mouthfeel : literally warms the mouth . the aftertaste , however can leave a lingering feel in the mouth that is often hard to get rid of . drinkability : now do not mistake my score . the beer is very drinkable . however the alcohol content and potent flavors make it difficult to drink more than two or three . have n't had a chance to have my fair share of christmas brews yet , but i have to believe that this one will be hard to top ."

S"i drank this from a bottle into a chalice . the beer pours a very dark brown color , amber when you held it up to the light , with a one finger tan head that disappears quickly . its really a disappointing color compared to other stouts . the smell is overwhelming coffee beans , way to simple and overpowering . tasting was also is a disappointment , it was like drinking a cold cofee with some rubbing alcohol . it was n't thick , did n't stick to my throat . it was a boring , lazy effort ."

S"pours a clear dark brown with a 2 inch puffy tan head that settles to a small cap . thin foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down . smell is of toasted malt , yams/pumpkin , citrus zest , and spices . the smells are pretty good but no one aroma stands out really . taste is of roasted malt , wood , spices , plants , and vegetables . no particular flavors stand out , more like everything just melds together in some bizarre concoction . there is a medicinal herbal bitterness that lingers on the tongue after each sip . this beer has a nice carbonation with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel . however , this is just not a very good beer . the random mix of ingredients makes for a fairly good smell but comes out very jarring in the taste . it seems like these brewers just got together and tossed out random ideas for ingredients . not a very good collaboration beer from this year 's series in my opinion ."

S"poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz . bottle . this , the latest in what will indubitably be a continuing cascade of collaboration beers indeed pours its namesake . namely , black . hardly a highlight to be found , yet the mocha head runs away rather swiftly , leaving a somewhat glassy surface . nose of a hoppy and roasty porter with some light alcohol notes . some roasted chocolate and carob and a bit of a brown sugar roux that went a bit too long on the flame . somewhat smokey in nature with air . smoked porter on steroids ? ? warms to add some black cherry . flavor is coarse and rich with a notable chocolate malt finish . bit of hop and cinnamon spice accompany . cherry infused chocolate flavors of sabra liqueur arrive and depart at times on the finish yet do n't set up camp due to the malt coarseness . offers a nice finish but is excessively rich to revisit soon . perhaps as a shared accompaniment to a decadent dessert would be a good call ... ."

S"i have to concur with ding here , although maybe not to the same degree . read his post first and then mine to see where we differ . there is indeed a stong bitter taste throughout that lingers too long ... . well , not really too long ... let 's say unpleasantly . it may or may not be from hops alone . i 'm not sure . it tastes like there 's more that 7.3 % alcohol in it too . i 'm a homebrewer and it reminds me of an illfated double ipa i tried last year . i tweeked a recipe way beyond the boundries of the prescribed hop additions . because i had read somewhere that only so much hop character can be extracted during a concentrate wort boil , i added like 9 oz . of chinook pellets at the beginning and let-r-ride ! now , i 'm a hophead but that batch was way too bitter with a similar artificial funk to it , even though there was nothing artificial in my beer . to a lesser degree , this beer 's hop profile reminds me of that batch ... which of course i did drink ! ( side note -- most of it i cut with a case of cheap red hook ipa someone bought me because they new i like ipa and knew nothing about beer . ) on the plus side , there is a real heavy ( right on the money ) malt presence ; bisuitty with a touch of chocolate in the taste profile . right on the money for an american strong . i do n't hate this beer at all . i 'll drink it . i like the fact that it 's easy to get here and comes in a 12 oz . bottle . i am going to try aging some of this stuff for a year or two to see if it mellows , then i 'll reevaluate it . cheers !"

S"color is a bright copper with red hues . head was maybe just over 1/4 inch . i noticed a unique tint to the color of the head ... like a greenish seafoam , almost like the color of the bottle 's label , but lighter of course . as others mentioned , head did n't last . aroma was surprisingly thin , although i think i was expecting something heavier because of the abv . they were going for a higher abv but still smooth , very drinkable lager , so although i was expecting more for the nose , it did n't bother me . what i did get were the usual hints of floral hops over malty sweetness - a wonderful smell but something we 've all experienced plenty of times . i 'm having a bit of trouble describing the taste because it has definitely had a changing impact as i drink . usually complexity like this is what we look for , but i have to say that the first sip was the best . here 's what i noticed ( in terms of taste and mouthfeel ) , in chronological order , from first sip to last : crisp , light sweetness ; breadiness ; very round , soft mouthfeel ( the word plush came to mind ) ; a very mild and inoffensive sourness ; chewy caramel , an earthy , raininess ( sorry for making up a word ) ; and , by the last sip , butter and a heavy sweetness . it was a good beer and i enjoyed it , but could n't help but notice the loss of perceived crispness as i drank . mouthfeel : primarily a distinct roundess , but i also noticed an interesting sensation that the rear-mid section of my palate felt `` numbed '' for lack of a better word . great job on making a solid/complex but sessionable lager . absolutely one to try , but probably not one for the record books ."

S"purchased from target in jones valley , huntsville , al . very clear , light amber color with quickly-diminishing head . i guess it 's pretty much as-expected for a pale ale , but it did n't really impress me on appearance . interesting scent . upon first whiff , this one screamed `` pilsener '' to me , but after a few minutes , i found myself finding much more complex notes of apple and tart , along with a nice generous dose of bitter hops . had a nose more like an amber than a pale ale -- color me impressed . color me less than impressed with the flavor here . very weak taste , with minimal hops and with little to be said for it except that it 's liquid and drinkable . some of the apple presence in the nose is still here , but it 's faint , and i 'm feeling more like i 'm getting nasty runoff from a better beer than anything . it 's not a drain-pour here , but i 'm really not enjoying the flavor , and i do n't think it fits the style of a pale ale at all . mouthfeel is decent here . some mild carbonation and hop crispness gives it the mouthfeel of a pale ale , but without transcending anything . overall , i 'm rating the drinkability fairly low . i 'm glad i only bought a single of this , for the other five might have been drain-pours for me . it 's probably a good bottled beer to share with bmc drinkers , but the lack of flavor bothers me and i do n't think i 'll be buying it again ."

S'pours a deep brownish red with one finger head , quickly fading . not bad looking but not really distinctive . aroma is a different story - a brilliant complexity increasing with warming . note of raisins , apples , cherries and perhaps other fruit in the nose with a hint of brown sugar and alcohol lurking behind the prominence of the fruit . taste is also quite interesting and complex . caramel malt and all that fruit up front . alcohol bite seems to ride in the middle . easy on the hops bitterness , slight sour quality at the back . sweet bread finish . medium mouthfeel , average for style . not grasping for more than one at once , but quite enjoyable as a stand alone experience .'

S"750ml bottle ( is there any other on the market ? ) into duvel glasses . appearance - dark , not-quite-black , with red highlights . head is creamy tan and looks great , but falls down amazingly fast . while i typed this sentence it went from full and large , to almost non-existent . rapidly the had settles into a patch that fails to even cover the top , and leaves no lacing . smell - malty , candy sweet . do n't smell much chocolate in here , what tiny bit there is seems overwhelmed by the malty sugar smell , which is overall too sweet , without being chocolaty at all . even after warming in the glass for a while , no chocolate smell comes forth . taste - here is chocolate , finally . a decent amount up front , mingled with the bitter alcohol flavor , lots of chocolate on the swallow , along with the after taste . the level of chocolate is *very* high , but the *quality* of chocolate is very low : it tastes more like nestle 's quick than real chocolate . also , for a beer with only around 5 % abv , the alcohol flavor more noticeable than you might expect . young 's chocolate stout ( 5 % ) had less alcohol taste , as did ommegang 's chocolate beer ( 7 % ) . after a half glass , the after taste builds up to the point where it makes the beer hard to drink . mouthfeel - velvety-but-thin . if that does n't make sense to you , it does n't make sense to me either . the beer feels smooth and velvety in the mouth and on the way down , not too much carbonation ( in fact not much at all ) gives it the smooth texture of milk , but the body and weight of less-than-skim milk . drinkability - this is n't meant to be an every-day , go-to beer . this is not intended for sessioning , or for pounding back during the game . even with that considered , drinkability is low . i ca n't imagine why i would drink this beer when so many better chocolate beers are on the market . when the price is taken into consideration , the whole thing seems laughable . to be honest , the only reason i am finishing this is because it was 13 $ . summary- i saw that the reviews for this beer were n't great , but i decided to pick one up , for the fun bottle , and to have after my ommegang chocolate indulgence . the head-to-head is that the ommegang is better , as well as being cheaper . i know i will not buy this beer again , and honestly , i think if someone offered me some , i would prefer something else ."

S"it 's been awhile but we 're back in style-ile ... had this one tonight at the linwood and man , let me tell you , this is one heavy beer . it took me close to an hour to drink my one pint , and the thick and frothy head never once let up . deep , rich , and gold-tinged amber in colour , the head on this brew is just unbelievable , and certainly a new legend and classic . aromas give us solid notations of hops , smokey goodness , and piney , barky hops . drinking this thing is like trying to inhale an entire redwood forest , roots and forest floor included . the flavor is solid and the mouthfeel is there , but this is one big and thick brew . delicious and solid but not something you 're going to have night after night , if you 're paying $ 4 for a pint of this you are definately getting your money 's worth . if this beer were an album it would be the first cathedral lp or black sabbath 's `` sabotage '' slowed down to half speed . yeah ... oh yeah ."

S"if this came in a more managable bottle this would easily be my favorite beer ! i find that the 2006 bottling is the superior to the '05 . much more flavorful than before . strong chocolate malts with a creamy texture that is almost fluffy on the palate . goes down terrifically smooth and leaves you begging for more . everything about this is gorgeous ! it looks almost like a stout , but still manages to let in a hint of light . has a strong coffee like smell and just hints at the onslaught of creamy chocolate to come . my only qualm with this is that it comes in such a large bottle ."

S"this beer pours an exciting cloudy orange brown ( apple juice ? ) color with a small head that laces well . the smell presents many fruits - namely apples with hints of pear and white grape . there are also notes of the spices mentioned on the bottle ( yarrow , sweet gale , and rosemary ) . the taste comes on mildy spicey , but is quickly replaced with fresh and fermented fruits . this , coupled with the choice of accompanying spices , produces a very ( overly ) sweet beer . beyond this beer 's super-sweetness , there is an overabundance of the rosemary spice . although interesting to taste , this beer did not keep my drinking palette interested for the entire beer - towards the end i was starting to regret drinking it . this review was the 4th time i had tasted the beer - i wanted to make sure that i had given this one a true open-minded opinion . in summation , i wish that only 2 of this beer came in my sampler case - but instead , they gave me 8 . i will probably not drink the remaining 4 ."

S"brewed with american 2-row , english wheat , belgian , and dextrin malts , and hopped with centennial and cascade hops . og=1.052 , 5.4 % abv , 55 ibu . firm `` psssht '' blows the cap off , and pours out to a slightly hazy caramel with orange accents , forming a very large , peaking whipped light beige head with excellent retention and lacing . carbonation is medium . aroma is delicately fruity with lots of citric hops , floral dryness , dust , green apples , navel oranges , a touch of sweet caramel , and some kiwi fruit . aroma is dry and dusty , akin to many spontaneously fermented belgians . i wonder if this is infected ? mouthfeel is spritzy and alive with a medium body and astringent finish . taste begins with a mild , dusty citric hoppiness and mild bitterness up front , followed by predominate kiwi fruit , a splash of pineapple , and the finish is bone-dry , clean , and brief with a touch of sourness and aluminum bitterness in the aftertaste . alcohol is too strong in the finish for a 5.4 % abv brew . this has the makings for a great pale ale , however the kiwi fruit flavor has me worried about it 's longevity . the metallic sourness and hint of alcohol in the finish also detract from the taste . i noted these issues on a 6/28/2004 review , and this 2nd 22oz bottle today ( 5/12/11 ) has the same character ."

S'corked and caged bottle pours a hazy light amber golden color , with a three finger head that slowly subsides . lacing is minimal . aroma is pleasant . frash bread , yeasty , and light fruit , such as pears shine through . relatively mild aroma for the style though . the flavor here makes the beer . almost perfectly balanced , with flavors ranging from yeasty esters if pears and apples , to fresh baked bread , to wheat flavors and phenols , to a hoppy dry finish . slighty sweet with a few caramel flavors up front , but finished hoppy and slightly dry.quite nice ande exquisetly balanced . mouthfeel is creamy due to the carbonation , and drinkability is on par for the style .'

S"a-dark brown , near black with a thick day tan head . slight cascade effect . s-very malty smelling ... coffee and chocolate ... predictably . seems to be a good mix of both . strong smell . you can detect some hops and possibly cherries too . t-comes in with a strong taste of milk chocolate made with sour milk . it just reminds me of milk that 's been left out too long . there are possibly some berries in there as well . has a long lasting after-taste of dark berries and milk chocolate with a touch of coffee . m-creamy low carbonation with a dry finish o-an imperial stout in a bomber that disappears rather quickly . its definitely tasty though i feel it does n't stand up to the big dogs , despite its name . it 'll help with stout cravings , though it might not fulfill them ."

S"poured a light amber - very clear ! huge head dominated by big bubbles but with a nice , tight , creamy cover that translates over time to a very nice covering lace . it smells like ringwood yeast . no doubt about it . dang ! and it tastes , well , like ringwood . it 's all buttery and creamy and really lightly malty and then there 's the lightly bitter finish to it ... gently fades on that bitter note - nothing really bad to say there . still , it tastes like an esb to me and definitely not a red - there 's just not enough maltiness to it , not really enough body , and the bitter tones are n't quite hoppy - they 're just bitter , if you know what i mean . i mean , heck , i bet it would be great on cask or something like that , but , again , not as an amber - more as an old-thumper wanna-be ."

S"beer presented a dark rust with a thin brown head . my first experience trying a gruit and the wiatress offered me a sample instead of a whole glass . nah , i 'll take the pint ... getting to the bottom is the only way i 'll understand the beer . smells ... menthol lypus ( spelling ? ) . not very beery . floral spiced , like rosemary or thyme . tastes a bit sour , definitely manthol lypus , with a hint of a mediciney flavor . like cherry cough medicine ... without the cherry flavoring . i think these flavor stick in my mind most , as the mouthfeel was thick and syrupy . the beer was n't entirely like drinking cough syrup , but had worn out it 's welcome by the end of the pint . i did n't take the last swig or two . as this was the first of the styule i 've had , i do n't know how it stacks up . rated to my preferences ( but i 've been pretty generous ) ."

S"colorful bottle , pours a nice amber with little head but nice lace . the aroma is a nice mixture of sweet malt and floral hops . this starts sort of crisp and light then the hoppiness kicks in . it is a sort of cherry , currant fruit hoppiness that is mellow but certainly present . this is truly a session beer that is easy drinking but has great qualities . if your looking for mega hops and flavor , it 's not here but if you want a quality drinking beer , this is it"

S"poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a st. bernardus glass . a : ruddy chestnut with a light , short-lived head . very clear , but with a nice internal glow . s : delicious , delicious hops . the six varieties promised in the title really shine through here in a complex intermingling of scents . malt is almost as prominent and more forceful by virtue of presenting a single , united aroma . strong , pleasant smell . t : the taste is a mishmash of a whole bunch of different things . what are very nice flavours individually collide headlong like a trainwreck on the tongue . the most obvious is the extreme hop bitterness . this bitterness is mildly unpleasant , i think due to the disharmonious amalgamation of hop strains -- this beer may be trying to do too much ( which is why , i suppose , they call it whole hog ) . the malt is very strong , but out-of-place and at odds with the bitterness . overall , this beer is a mess , but all the individual elements are good . m : smooth malt and dry hops . pleasant and stimulating . d : too bitter and confused to make for very good drinking . it took me a very long time to finish the glass . a very complex , intimidating brew , it may be over my head ... or it may just be underdeveloped . either way , i do n't recommend it ."

S"pours a deep auburn , what i do n't understand about the mikkeler single hop series , is that the colors of the beer are all different ? i thought it was the same beer , except the hops were different ? hops do n't lead to such a pronounced difference in appearance do they ? good aroma , typical grapefruit high bitterness to this one . zesty . standard taste , bitterness overwhelms the slightly sweet malt flavor , hoppiness stays prickly , a definite companion with spicy food . carbonation is good . a pretty standard ipa , generously hopped , malt sweetness , caramel . as usual , the price point on mikkeller 's single hop series is way above what is reasonable thereby hurting its overall score . almost $ 6 for a single hop cascade . . . or $ 7 for a 6pack of sn beer using cascade hops ? seriously ."

S"my roommate picked this new release up from our local liquor store as soon as he saw it and brought me home a couple . i had never heard of it before and was very curious about it . pours a *dark black* molasses color in the mug . really thick stuff here . the head and lacing is both thick/heavy and quality . a scent of cocoa and a bit of sweetness eminates from the top . interesting smell . the taste is even more interesting . a complex swirl of nuts , chocolate , piney oak trees , and smokey aftertastes fills the mouth for minutes on end . the mouthfeel comes out extremely creamy and solid and i believe it 's the best aspect of this beer . drinkability on the other hand is the lowest - i do not believe i can drink more than a few of these in a night , due to the thickness and extremity of the intricate taste . overall , i feel this is a great beer , but one that i would buy on sporadic occasions . i am pleased to have tried it , and ca n't say any other beer i 've tried is comparable ."

S"since this is n't my first bottle from this 6er i know to pour into a very large glass as the carbonation is quite excessive . aroma seemed to have a touch on phenol immediately , but none that i noted later . a relatively balanced aroma , especially for style . sweet slightly grassy hops , but definitely a a notable malt presence that is sweet as well . aroma is n't potent , but it is pleasing in its softness . the staleness ( not quite to cardboard , but close ) noted in the flavor first seems to appear in time in the aroma somewhat cloudy gold with lots of bubbles rising . head was exceedingly excessive , as anticipated ( at least 20oz glass that held only 1/2 of the original pour ) . a variety of hop presentations in the drink . several hop flavors and variability in the bitterness too . even at 6 months old there seems to be a staleness to the flavor that 's off-putting as it leads to a bitterness that carries it 's own off flavors . there is a nice sweetness up front , which helps , some . in an odd way it seems flat on the tongue yet filling in the stomach from carbonation . disappointing . bottled 7/3/07 . thanks linda ."

S"4/1/2011 on tap at urge . a : dark reddish amber with a frothy and creamy long lasting cap . head retains for a ridiculous amount of time . thick sheets of lacing remain . s : lightly spicy ( peppery ? ) with a strong wood profile . the wood seems to subjugate all else . that might be somewhat of a stretch , but it 's not far off . citrus notes are faint , and the malt is somewhere between bread and caramel . lots of wood , but not a lot of anything else . t : bitter and dry up front with a decided wood presence . i do n't know much about this beer , but i 'm picking up a moderate spicy quality . i 'm not sure if they used spices in this or if stems from a combination of wood and booze . evident orange and tamer notes of grapefruit accompany pine resin and a firm caramel malt profile . there 's some midpalate sweetness . alcohol has a commanding presence in the flavor and is far too prominent for my taste . wood remains strong throughout , and combines with the powerful booze and firm bitterness to make for a somewhat unpleasant boozy , tannic , and astringent finish . the wood adds nothing positive to the flavor . m : medium in body with upper moderate carbonation . mouthfeel is sticky , dry , and astringent . overall : too much booze and too much wood , with no positive attributes offsetting the negatives . not at all recommended ."

S"gi 's hefeweizen ( 2003 ) poured a hazy pale orange yellow colour . the head formed readily , and was creamy and thick . it reduced to a creamy thin layer , leaving a nice lacing on the glass . the aroma was interesting . i found some vanilla , and a little banana . there was also a tangy yeast smell , mixed with the wheat . the flavour was smooth and light , perhaps a little too smooth and too light . there was more vanilla than banana in the flavour -- last year 's was more estery if i remember correctly . wheat flavours were throughout , unsurprisingly . the yeast added a little bit of zing to it , but overall this was n't as distinctly flavoured as i remember last year 's to be ( i imagine both more spicy phenol and more banana ester ) . as i know i heard people describe it as `` that banana beer '' , i would n't be surprised if they intentionally toned it down a touch . in the mouth it felt creamy and lush , but finished light and refreshing . the carbonation was fairly light , but for me that just makes it a bit more easy-drinking . though i criticize , i have to say that gi 's hefeweizen is incredibly drinkable . i could drink these all day long . as far as refreshing , quaffable , cold summer beer goes , this beer has it . if you can find it , buy it ."

S"thanks to jason for bringing this rare and limited beer to the seaoffloydster tasting that took place march 28th ... i 've been looking forward to trying this beer . this review is for the limited 06/07 bottling . poured a dark golden with a decent head . sweet and tart berries with some powdery sugar and a touch of astringency in the background . some apples later on . light tart fruits with a somewhat chlorine flavor in the end . dry finish with some apples . good but nothing too outstanding . medium-low carbonation , very well suited for the beer . was n't too impressed with this one but i still have a bottle of the 07/08 bottling which i plan on doing a more detailed review . ***update 7-26-09*** had this one last night at the 'you bring the cheese tasting . ' thanks to roymunson for trading me this bottle . this was the 07/08 bottling . after trying this again i just had to update my review , this one was a strange one . i picked up a bit of chlorine again and plastic note , quite tannic . hardly any sourness or tartness at all , quite sweet with a weird plastic/choline finish that was hard to swallow . not enjoyable at all and could n't even finish my pour of this one ."

S'bottle : poured a decadent dark garnet colored ale with orange highlights into my goblet . tight 2 finger off white cap reduced to a thick surface lace that draped the gass sides with lace . looks like a glass of burgandy with a head . nose : complex.. grape or cherry skins , fruits in blasamic vinigar , some woodyness light detectable sweetness . a delightful tart fruityness . medium body , puckering but silky mouth feel , vinous sweet and sour character . starts musty-maltty and quickly turns on the complexity ... the tougue is pummeled with concord grape , apples , cherries , boysenberry , figs , vanilla pods , some tobbaco and lots of other tones too numerous to grasp in one mouthful ... .all this complexity is wrapped in a sweet and sour controlled acidy where the lactic acids and fruits are balanced off by sweetnes from rich malt and candi adjuncts . the finish is remarkably dry-tart where the vinous quility is experineced in a slow departure of tart fruit and musty-woody flavors ... slightly sweet aftertaste . my god what a ride ! ! this is a great beer for what it offers ... a speeding roller coaster of complexity in its delivery ... it may not be everyones cup of tea but until you have tried it consider yourself deprived .'

S"hmmm ... this beer is a bit of a conundrum . it claims to be an imperial stout , but tastes like something else . what that `` something else '' is ... i 'm not totally sure . this brew poured a deep , dark , black-ish color with very little head . the aroma is not typical for an imperial stout . ( perhaps it has more in common with a baltic porter ? ) maybe or maybe not . the aroma is subdued for the style and leads me to believe it 's something else other than an impy stout . the flavor is malty and clean . i like it , but it just does n't taste like an imperial stout . in fact , it 's quite smooth and mellow ... tasting like some sort of rich , dark , malty lager . who knows ... this might actually be a lager ? the strong roasty characteristics i associate with an imperial stout ( or regular stout ) are not up-front in this brew . this brew has a sweetness that overpowers everthing else . it is a clean-tasting ( and enjoyable ) sweetness , but this brew seems to be beyond anything i would normally associate with an imperial stout . in the end , i do like this beer quite a lot , but it does n't taste like an impy stout ."

S"wow , i 'm truly suprised at what a competant brew this is ( considering how horrible your typical vb is ) . the head is a rocky cream white that laces beautifully . the body itself is the is a transparent copper brown . it looks far more appetising than i had expected , if only there was a little more in the body to compliment the great head ! there is n't much on the nose , but that 's better than being offensive - it revolves mostly around a certain sweet malt aroma . sharp sweet malt and bitterness hits my pallet first , only before rolling off into a smooth aftertaste with biscuit and farmyard notes . there 's an element of metalic-twang , but it 's easily ignored with the other pleasant flavours present . the mouthfeel is generally creamy and plesant , but nothing to really write home about . it 's easy to drink , and if it did n't cost more than it 's worth i 'd happily throw-back a few more of these ."

S'bottle via trade thanks to knightrider on ba . pours a hazy golden color with a one-finger white head and very good lacing . aroma is bread , pale malt , caramel , and some grain . flavor is similar - bready and slightly grainy with slight caramel and some sugary sweetness . very mild grassy hops . like a mix between a zwickel/kellerbier and an oktoberfest really , which is fairly interesting . palate is medium-light , smooth , and sweet . this is very refreshing , not terribly exciting , but good . drinkability is really off the charts . goes down easier than water , and tastes a lot better too .'

S"bought this from a local whole foods . a - copper color with an off white head . s - fresh hops up front . not a very full or strong aroma . t - it does n't hit you over the head with hops but there is a presence there . not too complex . m - medium carbonation with a slight thickness to the consistency . d - i could definitely have a few more ! this is a very good brew . i 'm not the biggest fan of ipa 's but this one proved to be very well balanced and drinkable !"

S"appearance- a one and a half finger head that turns into a foamy film at the end . very translucent like dark brown color . smell- only a hint of malt as well as hops , with malt being the dominate one . taste- the malt flavor was excellent with some hops in the middle to do some balancing , but then ended with the roasted malts and water . mouthfeel- looks are deceicing , especially if you are n't familiar with schwarzbier . but something this dark is like a lager and can be consumed so easily . my palate was alight with a tasty roasted malt . nothing overpowering though . drinkability- excellent , i like anything dark in a beer , and this could turn into my regular beer of the day to drink when i want to forget the pain ... just kidding . but definetly beckons the drinker to consume more ."

S"on tap at giovanni 's in glastonbury , ct . served in a pint glass . appearance : waitress leaves a 3/4 inch fluffy white head that sticks around awhile leaving a few streaks of tight lacing . pours a cloudy yellow and leaves a few thin swatches and spots of lacing . smell : almost no aroma , even as the beer warms . some pleasant fruit and effervescence come out with time , but it 's very faint . taste : mildly lemony , spicy , with a full bready malt backbone that works perfectly with the creamy feel and high carbonation . moderately dry finish . delicious and refreshing . tempted to give it a higher score for taste , but perhaps it 's a bit too 1-or-2 note most of the time , and not quite hoppy enough ( there 's some spiciness and earthiness , but it 's not really in balance with the giant malt influence ) . that said , i absolutely love the flavor . some fruity highlights come out with warmth , making it even better . so refreshing . mouthfeel : light to medium bodied , creamy , with exactly the right level of carbonation ( high ) . dry enough finish . very satisfying . approaching perfection . overall : what a beautiful summer beer this is . walking into a small pizza joint to get out of the heat on a 90+ degree summer day , and ending up with this in my glass is very satisfying . great beer , and as perfectly seasonal as food or drink can be ."

S"this is from great lakes brewing co. , and takes it 's name from the infamous sunken freighter . i 'm hoping i sampled a bad batch because this tasted like it was dredged up from the bottom of lake erie ! way too bitter and hopped up , foul aftertaste ! it was not `` skunked '' , the aroma was what i expect from porter . i ca n't even come up with a constructive criticism on this one !"

S"i was really pleased to find this one on the shelf at the store today . pours a nice hazy shade of golden straw . the initial 1 finger , fizzy white head fades pretty quickly to think ring of skim and leaves behind only spots of slippery lace . the liquid is hazy , but the numerous tiny bubbles running throughout can still be seen . not a whole lot of aroma from this beer . i get the grains , which in a strange way smell kind of wet , and i also get a little bit of tart citrus . really nice . light and refreshing flavor . the wheat is crisp and hearty , and the lemony bite balances tart sourness with a hint of sweetness . the yeast gives an added dimension of flavor and mouthfeel in this beer . there 's a bit more body despite the bright fizziness . there 's just a slight stickiness left on the palate after the drink . it 's not complicated , but that 's a good thing . this is a super drinkable beer . it is light and refreshing , and it 's perfect for this time of year ."

S"a deep dark pint of thick molasses with a thin and fickle khaki to burnt cream head that leaves no lacing . the nose is faint and of dark malt and milk sugar . the taste starts creamy and smooth and the flavor comes out as it warms in the mouth . this beer is very roasty all the way through with a nutty , smokey character and accasional vanilla notes . really this is a fairly simple beer that drinks easy with a suprising dryness . my advice is drink this damn-near room temp . it got much better as it warmed . mouthfeel is thin and syrupy but i could down a six of these with ease . not totally sure about this `` scottish porter '' business , tastes like a damn fine dry stout to me but hey , it works as any of the three really ."

S"this beer is hardcore . i 'm glad i had a friend to share it with , because i got a hell of a buzz off of only half of the 750ml bottle . pours to a dark nutty brownish amber color with very little head . leaves no lacing on the glass , but does leave a syrupy film of sorts . the smell is great . smells very malty and sweet with some dark fruity esters and candi sugar . below that is a bit of a vanilla rum bozziness . i could bury my nose in this for quite some time , and i did . the taste is just as good as the nose . very sweet at first , but the flavors begin to really show as it warms from cellar temp . the alcohol is quite noticiable , but not harsh . very mellow , but with a decent bite to let you know it 's there . the drinkability is high on the `` would i try it again '' scale , but on the sessionability scale this scores very low . this stuff is hella strong ... a sipper to the core of its very being . quite savoury indeed ."

S"appears a bright copper golden large off white cream colored head leaves fine even lacing around my pint glass . aroma just a touch of floral hops with tame biscuit malt sweetness a touch of mineral qualities very clean and a bit subdued . flavor is interesting some grain offness blended with a sweet rolling caramel biscuit malt sweetness with bitterness based around perfumey floral hop flavors pretty brash really . after the inital sweetness i get the grainy nut flavor with citrus peel and floral hop flavors that 's about it . mouthfeel is medium bodied a touch of slickness but by no means oily and even carbonation no complaints there . drinkability is okay by no means poorly made this is solid drinking ipa and i 'm sure i would drink more of this if it were my only hoppy selection around but i see more hop character depth in standard ipas that i revisit regularly ."

S"i 'm not one to really like the funky green bottle with the hippie like colors and designs , but i have to say that the beer that comes from the bottle is looking pretty damn good . it pours out in a light amber color that looks a little darker than your typical ipa . the head is rocky and stays for quite some time . tiny bubbles stream from the inside of the glass . the head is almost pure white , but has a slight tinge . aroma is like whoa ... the dry hopping in this beer is apparent the first time you take a whiff of this beer . there 's a background sweetness in this beer , with a following of hop flavor . in the end this beer is very dry in your mouth and leave a slightly bitter aftertaste . not the most enjoyable . not bad , but just not my favorite ipa ."

S'served on tap at my bar . this is a beer whose charateristics change drasticly depending on how muhc of the keg is left . when a keg is new , it pours a crystal clear pale orange , at about a third of the way down it starts to haze , and close to the bottom it is totaly opaque and almost chunky from the fine sediment . i personally feel this beer is only worth drinking when it is close to the bottom , and this is when i reviewed it . a- a cloudy opaque orange . so much wheat , yeast , and sediment suspended that it swirls . fluffy white head which stuck around for a little while . s- strong citrus , orange , lemon , wheat and yeast . t- strong wheat flavor up front with a nice citrus orange quality . slightly spicey and rather yeasty in the finish . no real hops to speak of . mf- medium carbination , thicker bodied than what one would expect because of the sediment , however i would still call it light bodied . goes down easy and is a good summer beer .'

S"750ml corked and capped bottle . cork dates the brew from 02/05 . a : brilliant neon hazy solid gold . swirls of yeast and sediment visible . no head to speak of . virtually non-existent effervescence ; you can see the light bubbles , but you ca n't feel them . n : that trademark cantillon sourness is there ( peaches , apple cidre , pineapple even ) , but not as strong or `` distinct '' as usual , and rounded off a bit by the oak in the nose . wild yeast for sure . gives an image of sticking one 's face in a wooded bog , but then i like that sort of thing . t : not uncompromisingly puckering nor completely honeysuckled , nonetheless this is a variation on the usual theme . earthy , almost herbal sharp tones initially . browning leaves and twigs , dried unfragrant herbs , earth . dead centred apple cidre tart sourness encased within oak and earth . sharp , earth/brown tones branch out fro , the centre of the brew , blending in among the near sweet oakiness . lead pencil , old white burgundy , underripe tangerines , salt , mussel/clam/oyster liquer . buttery and honey/mead like in the finish . m : do n't know what happened to the carbonation-no indication whether or not it 's supposed to be there . body is medium , honey smooth in spots while also being tart and a bit sharp . nice , easy finish ( not unlike a well made verdicchio ) but burns a bit going down . notes : polskapanda ( with whom i split the bottle ) wondered if perhaps the bottle was `` corked '' explaining the lack of carbonation , but looking over the cantillon web site and some of the other reviews i 'm leading to believe that carbonation does not always happen with this particular style . no idea for sure , but it does certainly make me want to try this brew again ... though at $ 14.00/btl that may not happen for awhile . still , i do like the idea that the outcome of the brew is entirely dependent upon the reaction of the wild yeast , as well the wood aging and the brewmaster 's ability to tend to all of this , thus leading to a somewhat different brew each time a batch is made . of course , that is part of the magic of cantillon ."

S"wow what a long day ... hmm , a belgian-style scotch ale eh ... .you realize when you put the words `` scotch '' and `` ale '' together , i benchmark you with mcewan 's ... just sos ya knows ... pours a wonderful , clear mahogany . nary a wisp o ' head adorns this brew , and the carbonation be of the lighter sort . no real lacing forms . kind of `` mehh '' thus far , me hearties ... powerful aromas of roasted malt smacks you upside the face , kind of like how ben rothliesberger got his smeller crunched up like corn flakes . kind of a nice sweetness to it , and it smacks more of bourbon than scotch . a hint of smokiness in there ... very pleasant and `` warm '' smelling . 7 % abv and $ 4.49/bomber , which is a fair price . proceeds go to cancer research , so assume the price raises drinkability a little , a'ight ? ! flavor is more effervescent than i would have guessed . and slightly ... off . upfront , this has a lot of belgian golden ale qualities - a certain yeastiness , that similar mouthfeel , and some spice . it moves into a rather thin and confusing middle , not sure what it wants to be . the rather subdued scotch ale qualities - maltiness , sweetness , and roasty-roasto flavors - seem to be caber tossing themselves away , leaving just a hint of flavor in the billowing dust . i get some hints of a scotch ale , but not enough ... i want more , damnit ! ! ! it 's a bit thin on the finish , and unassuming . all-in-all worth the price , but just not great . what i like most : the price and wonderful aromas . what i like least : the thin middle and finish in the flavors , and lack of robust scotch ale notes . verdict : barely worth the price and only because it 's for charity ."

S"poured a 12 ounce bottle into a traditional shaker pint glass . nice golden amber hue with a decent amount of head . very little lacing left on the glass . the nose of this brew is mostly caramel sweetness offset by some piney , mint like hop notes and a fairly assertive touch of alcohol . malt taste of caramel sweetness is upfront and is followed up by a nice bitter hop bite and that is somewhat piney . the finish of this beer has a surprisingly strong alcohol hit , which meshes well with the hops , and actually somewhat adds to the refreshing feel of this brew as it does a nice job of cleansing the palate . even for a `` lighter bodied brew '' , the moutfheel is a tad light for my tastes , especially when taking the relatively high abv into consideration . this is an interesting brew which i actually ca n't decide how much i like . however , for what this beer seems it 's trying to be , which is a light bodied lager that is easy to have a few in a session , it almost seems out of whack with such an abv almost as high as your average ipa and such a light body . this is actually a good tasting brew , but i would prefer a beer with a more reasonable alcohol content for the style ."

S"thanks to beertracker for the trade ! served at 40 degrees in a standard ( lefthand ) pint glass . the bottle contained a small layer of sediment on the bottom which was poured along with the beer . the beer poured to a white , 2-finger head with a wonderful golden cloudiness . filtered wheats be damned . in my book , this is what a wheat beer should look like ! the aroma was clean and spicy - consistent with what one would expect from this style . taste equaled the aroma - clean with light citrus notes . the beer had a full mouth feel . i overuse `` clean '' once more to describe the finish which was very clean . as the glass emptied , a nice stay remained reminding me of my journey . the one aspect i missed from a true belgian style was the lack of sourness . just a hint would make this feel more belgian than american wheat . i did detect more of the belgian aroma around of the way through . overall this beer has incredible drinkability . i 'd love to have this offering on tap at my house on a hot summer day ."

S'11.2 fl . oz . poured into a tulip glass . it porued a dark almost mahogany color . the head which orginally poured thick , slowly fade away to thin lining . it did leave a good amount of lacing on the inside of the bottle . the aroma was of a sour wine , the acidity felt bubbly in my nose . maybe a slight green apple aroma . the taste was sweet yet sour . the carbonation tasted almost of a cider with tiny , yet never ending bubbles on the palate . this beer is not much of a drinker . maybe a sipper . i would recommend splitting an 11.2 , unless you enjoy sourness .'

S'( served in an american pint glass ) a- this beer has a brown body with a reddish hue and it is crystal clear . there is a light tan head that last a good while . s- the smell of dark toasted malt is slightly sweet but there are no black malt smells . t- the taste of lightly toasted malt like vienna malt has a background of darker toasted malt that gives a little depth . there is a slight pot caramel note that comes through more as it warms . the finish is a faint hop hint with a slight sour note that really increases as it warms . m- this beer has a medium mouthfeel with a slight dryness to the finish . d- this beer has some nice malt flavors but there are a few off flavors and the sour note in the finish gets in the way .'

S"on tap at the brewery , served in a small snifter . dark purplish color with minimum head . smell is all grapes and currants , very sweet , smooth , and intoxicating . taste is the same , overloaded with sweet currant and grape with a nice mix of intense alcohol . could be considered comparable to a carbonated dessert liqueur . it is delicious . this is a very unique beer that i 'd recommend every beer lover try at least once ."

S"there 's definately chocolate in the beverage -- not just some chocolate notes in the malt ( so i disagree with some of the reviews ) , but it 's not so obvious to be a `` chocolate indulgence . '' it 's opaque dark brown with persistent foam lacing clinging to the glass , which smells decidedly chocolaty . that 's a start . to me , the chocolate flavor buries much of the dark complexity without making the brew into a chocolate beverage itself . i get hints of dark fruit and roasted grain , but it tends to wash out in the bittersweet aftertaste . it 's got a rich mouthfeel , but the 750 ml bottle must be shared -- i could never finish it myself ."

S"my beer-loving husband says this beer smells i do when i get out of the shower . i do n't know if that compliments me or the beer , but i 'll take them both . the beer ( is this really beer ? ) pours a golden apple color with quite a bit of fizz . the smell is intoxicatingly apple and made my mouth water . the taste is much like a hard cider and full of bubbly , crisp apples . the hops were light and malt made a quick appearance at the end of the taste . the mouthfeel was as crisp as the taste with high carbonation and a tasty zing of apples . if you 're in the mood for apple beer , then i 'm sure you 'd find this highly drinkable . for me , it 's not unpleasant but a beer i 'd have to be in the mood for ."

S'i was so shocked to find a pint of this at one of my local favs . i guess this was of limited availability in march of 2006 and is now replaced with golden era ; yet i was lucky enough to stumble across a couple bottles . the head was so impressive it was shocking , white , bubbly , and largelike the reaction from adding vinegar to baking soda . but , the lace and stickiness which remained was much like a spider web ; it sinisterly stuck to the sides of the glass , perfectly white and pure and gooey . the body is as gold as midas touch , and just as pure and clear in the complexion as in the head . nose is alcohol , yeast , and fruitthis reminds me of a really good triple . raisin and mustiness take over the initial aromas followed by a slight grain nuttiness . the flavors are remarkable , like nothing ive had before , not even golden era . it has a syrupy consistency which miraculously fades to a supremely dry mouth feel , followed by a sugared fig aftertaste . the supreme abv is also detectable . this is like sipping on a fine port or brandy , unbelievably smooth . flavors are quite intense , pilsner barley and impressive hops . flavors run the gamut from dry chalky grain to fruity bananas and fig , which is followed closely by a dry hop palate teaser . oh , so smooth and sipptastic ! enjoyif you can find it .'

S"i do n't know what to think of this beer . in some ways it 's really schizophrenic . pours an orange-light amber with an enormous white , frothy head that has pretty good staying power . smells enormously of apple . the first thought that came to mind was mott 's apple juice . other than that , it has a little spice , alcohol , and loaded with malts . taste is so damned complex . initially you taste the alcohol . then you begin to taste the fruit - again the apple with some other unidentified fruit . this immediately moves to a huge syrupy sweetness that 's almost too much to handle . ( reminds me of gulden draak . ) this is why drinkability suffers . finishes on the dry side . very smooth and creamy mouthfeel . i really do n't know what to make of this , and i 'm absolutely confused ."

S'this is one great ipa . it pours a nice orange amber color with a small head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing . the smell is fantastic , with strong notes of orange , grapefruit , pine , pineapple , lemon and a bit of malt . very nice , clean , delicious . the taste is a great elaboration of the smell , with lime , pine , grapefruit , orange rind , pineapple and a bit of malt and a ton of bitterness . intense but fantastic . not for the non hophead . some spicy heat that i can only guess is from the alcohol and maybe the hops . the mouthfeel is creamy and rich with lively carbonation . medium but full body . drinkability is good , but the intensity of the flavors and the high abv makes this a bit tough to drink a lot of . overall : benchmark california ipa . fruity , piney , bitter and creamy . absolutely a knock out . it competes with my hometown masala mama .'

( whew , because i am not a fan of extreme bourbon flavor in a beer ) . begins with some dark chocolate and coffee grinds . an ever so slight bit of bittering on the finish , with a lingering smokey coffee grind bourbon flavor . alcohol warms the body , but does n't overwhelm the flavor . thick and chewy mouthfeel . definately meant to be a sipper , though my impatience makes me intuitively reach for the glass hoping to discover another complexity in this immense brew . drinkability suffers dues to high price , availabilty and heavy coffee grind flavors . glad to have had the opportunity ! earned my mug with this review !"

S"burbon barrel barelywine . once again like their labyrinth , pliers were used to remove a stubborn cork . a : dark penny copper on the pour appears a dark burnt mahogany in the glass . against artificial back lighting appears a deep ruby red with a fair clarity and a strong effervesce which was confirmed by a loud pop by a stubborn cork . a monstrous head of 3 fingers quickly forms but lapses almost as quickly with a glossy tan color and moderate retention . the lacing was good leaving random clumps adhering to the glass with good coverage . s : on the nose moderate detection of sweet burbon and dry caramelized grains . sweet and boozy with the alcohol providing subtle complimentary hints and does n't even come close to the reported 11.1 % abv . some burbon soaked dried apples rounds things out . t : the booze that lacked on the nose made up for it on the flavor . strong burbon and barrel woodiness with boozed soaked instances of fruit and vanilla . scotchy caramelized grains with a bit of dry burbon booze drying the tongue . the booze was really evident flavorwise and perhaps consumed and masked other attributes . m : for mouthful a thick caramaleized grain juice substance with a warming booziness of burbon best sums up things here . good deal of carbonation with a bit of dry burbon booze parching the tongue . d : initially a booze shock , but does ease up a bit once you get past the first sip or two becoming easier to handle and consume . just had their labryrinth , which at 13.1 % seemed light years lower then this . boozy warmth and a nice experience but ultimately drinkability wise registers as average due to the high alcohol presence ."

S"the nose on the beer is filled with centennial hops and some fruitiness . the nose is quite pleasant . the colour of the beer is golden/light copper colour the beer come across as quite bitter with some notes of alcohol at the end , but there is a strong citrus flavour in the background . the beer is incredibly balanced even with the huge bitterness . the pale malts of the beer come through slightly , but there is n't much there . the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied , so it fits well . the beer is probably the most drinkable iipa , i 've ever had . it 's so smooth and subtle , but complex . great tasting ale , but it needs more hop complexities . it 's an all centennial beer , so it tastes great , but it 's just lacking a bit of punch in the hop department ( i know it sound weird to say that for an iipa , but i like the complexity of mixed hops ! )"

S"according to the label on this particular bottle , this beer should be good through september . that may be , but at least the bottle i had , one of the things i wondered right off the bat was how fresh it is/was . the beer pours a peachy orange color with good head retention and lacing . i do n't get a lot on the nose , just some light citrus and sweet malt . on the palate , this beer is intriguing . there really seemed to be a lot going on , with a melange of different flavors . unfortunately , not everthing i tasted was attractive . as the label indicates , there is a considerable malt presence in this beer , and initially i got flavors of brown sugar , cherry and butter , but then there is a considerable onslaught of hoppy bitterness/citrus , along with considerable alcohol in the finish . the combination is intriguing , but i ca n't say i found it attractive . in particular , the noticeable alcohol really wore me out as i went along , and eventually i flat out could n't drink any more of this beer . frankly , i thought the beer very out of balance , which is why i questioned this beer 's freshness . on the other hand , there was certainly a very noticeable hop presence in this beer , and there was nothing about that aspect of the flavor profile that would lead me to believe this beer was too old . in any event , i just have to say that this was another dipa where the combination of sweetness and noticeable high alcohol made for a bad combination , and really detracted from the beer 's drinkability . i 'm afraid i 'm not impressed ."

S"$ 6.99 for a 22oz bottle @ bevco . no stats on the website other than 52 ibu and 10.5 % abv . pours out to a thick opaque black , forming a nice whipped dark espresso crema head with amazing retention and one sticky sheet of lace . carbonation is mild to moderate . the aroma is pungent with anise ... i 've never smelled this much anise in a beer before , sitting on top of some burnt bananas , burnt chocolate frosting and black walnut with a whiff of alcohol . very unique nose . the mouthfeel is rich , sticky , and thick . the taste is a recap of the aroma ... lots of anise up front , which turns into an interesting and potent black licorice aftertaste , herbal bitterness which barely restrains the overabundance of blackstrap molasses and burnt malts ... lots of black patent , maybe even some roasted barley burnt astringency . this is one hell of a beer . very potent and rich , which makes it very hard to drink even 10oz of the stuff . burnt black oily bitter licorice is the best way to describe this one . certainly an interesting and unique brew , but i do n't know that i will buy it again as it 's so overwhelming ."

S"reviewed from notes -- poured into standard pint pours a dark apple cider color with a toffee colored head bubbling up a solid 2 fingers . thick and heavy lacing finishes off a ver inviting looking beer . the smell has some sweet notes with some decent citrus and floral hops and a little pine note as well . the nose is fairly weak , but still , not offensive at all . the taste is of spiced malts ... bitter hops . not flavorful hops ... just bitter ones . and a surprisingly large alcohol bite towards the finish . the beer is full-bodied with acceptable carbonation . for an imperial ipa , this is weak . even more so considering it is a winter seasonal . and at only 7.5 % abv , it is sad that they ca n't balance it well enough for me not to taste the alcohol . i understand the idea of a winter warmer ... but the alcohol presence is on my tongue , not in my chest . this beer does slightly improve as it warms ... but enough to save it in my mind ."

S"i 've got really mixed feelings about this beer ! it poured ebony black . with a thin white head that dissipated . the aroma was of black licorice . this is followed by a very powerful licorice flavor . ( i 'm not a fan of black licorice ) . i felt it needed quite a bit more maltiness , more roastiness . perhaps , my problem is that the black color made me expect more roasted flavor ? it finished pretty clean leaving maybe a note of coriander . i was n't a fan ."

S"this has been one of my favorite beer drinking experiences since i discovered it . i only have one once every 3-4 months or so , but am enjoying one on a special occasion tonight , and feel inclined to finally write a review . appearance is not what this beer is about . it does n't have much of a head , even if poured vigorously ; it 's cloudy and a dull brown in color , and it really does n't do much in this category . however , as the glass gets closer to your nose , you pick up a sharp astringent smell that let 's you know this one is hot . if you like this sort of thing , like i do , then you know this is something special . it is very distinctive , with grapefruit , pine sap and some sweetness , too . a sip brings more of the same , and with real force . a major reason why i rate this one highly for taste and mouthfeel is how a few drops of this beer light your mouth up . having been a whiskey drinker for many years , it still surprises me that a `` mere '' beer can do this . drinkability is what anyone should expect from something this strong . i would never dream of drinking more than one in a night , but even so , you still spend the whole evening drinking it , as it is a slow sipper . more of an experience than just a beer . try it at least once . if you like this sort of thing , you know who you are , and you will be back for more ."

S"this beer pours a gorgeous golden/amber color and is visibly thick ( thanks to the two hour hopping process mentioned in the name ) with some large white yeast formations on the top of the glass . the beer smells pretty good , very hoppy like one would expect from this type of beer . the taste is overbearing . the alcohol taste is very strong and the hop taste is equally overpowering . i 'm a fan of ipa 's but this beer is simply too much for me . it coats the inside of your mouth and even burns with biterness . it took me an hour to drink the beer . only recommended for extreme hop-heads ."

S"picked this up as a single at a local convenience store . has a freshness date of jun/09 , not sure if that is the bottling date or best by date . pours a clear medium yellow color with a pretty nice looking creamy white head . retention is not bad and it even leaves a bit of lacing on the glass . smells like wet grains with a mild floral and grassy hop aroma . does not smell bad , but is pretty faint . hmmm , the taste is where this one starts heading south ... in a hurry . melting plastic infused cardboard describes the flavor of this beer pretty well . stale graininess ? check . there is some sort of bitterness there , but usually hops dont provide this foul of an aftertaste . drain pour contemplation ensues ... not a good sign . hopefully our olympians in 2016 will have better options than this poor offering . this would make even a poor adjunct lager , and as a pilsner it 's atrocious ."

S'bottle courtesy of mrretardedmonkey poured into a pint glass . pours a deep clear orangish amber with a big off-white head that lingers as a cap throughout and leaves sporadic lacing . the aroma is very well balanced for an american ipa with the malts balancing the hops well . there are some citrus and earthy hops up front before the generous sweetness of the caramel malts and toffee takes over . the taste is just as well balanced with the earthy hops present up front but not overpoweringly so . the caramel malts are in the background with a slight pine hop bitterness in the finish . the mouthfeel is very smooth and not prickly or bitter like many ipas out there . this is one of my favorites from portsmouth and the drinkability is off the charts for me . i drank the bomber in 3 minutes flat . just kidding ... or am i ? recommended .'

S"not a bad helles at all . remember that this is the `` real '' lwenbru and not the beck 's wannabe brewed by miller for years . this review is based on the bottled version ... which also happens to be in a sealed paper case and relatively fresh . i 've had this on tap in munich , but i did n't really make any notes or remember it standing out from the other helles offerings . pours a pretty light straw yellow color . probably the lightest one from munich , but still well within the style . smells crisp and malty . definitely a beer that 's focusing on the malt over the hops . taste is refreshing and definitely sweeter than the others . hops are there and they keep things partially in-check , but they probably could benefit from a bigger presence . mouthfeel 's spot-on and drinking a bunch of these would be no problem . it 's definitely no augustiner or hofbrau , but it 's still pretty good for what it is . a dash more hops and color are really all it needs . if you 're wanting a sweeter helles , this it probably the leader . because it 's a pretty subtle style , details matter . take my score as a comparison to other helles beers moreso than a statement . it 's good and it 's stylistically solid , but you just ca n't have much room for error when compared to the other helles beers in munich . i 'd say this is the `` worst '' of the bunch , but it 's still pretty solid ."

S"the pour : mmmm , a pleasure to the senses right from the 750 ml bode white bottle . the appearance : chestnut brown , the color of warm sienna or effervescent ice tea . nice swags of lace drape the sides of my glass . bubbly , sudsy head that piled up and interestingly stayed peaked in the middle for a time while around the sides it receded rather quickly with the center following swiftly after it . still there 's a lively column of effervescing bubbles rising nicely in my glass , nice carbonation . the nose : well ... intriguing . it 's woodsy , musty , gingery , balsamic , acidic ( aahhh those belgian yeasties ) and compelling with some malt and sour cherries . you expect a beer to taste good when a whiff can make your mouth water . the taste : wow is this beer interesting , and tasteee . a sour abbey dubbel ! ! fruity , sour cherry with aromatic spices . yeah , sour cherry jam over brown toast . it 's not as sour as some that i love but it 's crisp , mouth watering and thirst quenching . satisfying . i 'm hooked ! ! mouthfeel : the body/mouth feel is just a tad thinner than other dubbels i 've enjoyed . the long draughts i take leave some residual stickiness around the rim ( man i ca n't stop sucking this down , i need to sip this and savor it more ) . finish : the long finish is particularly satisfying , it 's warming but i do n't detect the alcohol as much as i expected to . it does n't have quite the malt sweetness ( what happened to tall the malt i detected in the nose ) to give it that sweet/tart character but that makes it eminently drinkable . i want more barkeep , keep em coming . why should you drink this : personally , i love the sour beers styles so this fits my taste . like others of the sour style it might not be for everyone . but if you like a session beer that has some unique mouth puckering character , that 's lip smacking and thirst quenching , ( and you can find it ) drink this !"

S"poured from the bottle into a tasting glass . has a nice dark red color with 1 finger of light brown head . not a lot of aroma coming through - i let it warm up on the counter for 15 mins , maybe should have let it go longer . only distinguishable smell is some cloves . take a sip and you get hit with a ton of spice and a nice , full body . not a ton of bitterness , and the finish is pretty fast and a bit watery . i tasted this with a year aged bottle from '07 and the '07 was much better ."

S'poured from an 11.2oz bottle labelled as 2005 edition . the beer was dark burnt copper color with almost no head . the aroma was stong and hinted at an ass-kicking from alcohol . the taste confirmed it , this beer tore my head off and crapped down my throat . it was way strong with alcohol , but extremely sweet at the same time . the mixture of sweet and burn made me pucker with each sip . a very strange and interesting dopplebock , but not easy-drinking enough to recommend .'

S"appearance : brown with a ruby tint . pretty good head and lacing . whitish brown head that stayed for a little while . aroma : malty , fruity , alcoholic . nothing out of the ordinary here . taste : not much here . a light sweet malty flavor with a little chocolate in the background but i ca n't find much else . mouthfeel : watery with moderate carbonation . nowhere near as strong as a dopplebock 's mouthfeel should be . drinkability : easy , but why would you want to have another ? notes : this was not very impressive to me . i had both the ayinger celebrator and samichlaus in the same weekend , and this one impressed me as being average , almost bock-like in its maltiness , certainly not up to dopplebock standards ."

S"have to review this beer to style , and it is my favorite american macro . a consistent performer that is classically american in style . a - nice golden yellow , very bright and clear s - malted corn smell with a light aroma t - great taste ( again to style ) with clean flavor , a sweeter corn taste and very fresh and crisp m - just average here , although the carbonation adds to the crispness of this beer d - very drinkable for this style . with other american macros i get bloated ( carbonation , maybe ) but this is easily a sessionable lager . especially at the local bar after work with the gang , this beer is a good choice ( my opinion ) once again , as reviewed to style i really enjoy this beer . `` champagne of beers '' may not be the most appropriate name , but maybe the `` champagne of macro lagers '' . for anyone looking for a good american macro to try , this is a good bet ."

S"*re-reviewed on 7/30/09* the taste has developed much more and it 's drinking wonderful now . not as cloyingly sweet , which had turned me off . i did n't really find any flavor from the oak though . the nose has a huge soy sauce aroma too . i 'm giving a lower rating to the smell and bigger rating to the taste . *original review* pitch black liquid with a dark tan head . smells like chocolate , sweet malt , bourbon creeping in , vanilla , oak . taste is very sweet . intense malt . bourbon is n't as prominent in the flavor profile as expected . oak is there but backlashed by the overall sweetness . alcohol is amazingly well hidden behind this barrier of sugary liquid . not much of a surprise ."

S"had this on tap the other night not having any idea about what it kinds of beer it was but i figured it was going to be something on the lighter side . it poured a pale gold color with a small white head . it was pretty smooth going down with a moderate amount of carbonation . it left a little bit of lacing along the way . the taste wasnt bad . there was a light hop flavor with a lighter malty taste as well . there wasnt much in the way of citrus scents but there were some floral scents . it wasnt bad but i 'm not a huge fan of lighter beers but this would be very refreshing on a hot day but it would not be something i would seek out at a bar very often"

S"oh wow , this is a big , fantabulous beer ! founders does great things with barrels . pours thick and rich into a goblet ; motor-oil dark beer spreads over the glass underneath an off-white coating of foam that quickly dissipates . smells of raisins and dried currants , vanilla , oak , and smoke ; hints of leather and tree bark . more aromas emerge as the beer warms , but that will have to wait for subsequent re-reviews . i 'm having trouble waiting , though . tastes start off with big , sweet , soppy , thick , rich complex molasses and vanilla . bourbon is assertive and sweet , as is oak and smoke from the charred barrel . some sweet dried fruit ; figs and dates are in the taste not present in the nose . again , more nuance and complexity comes out as it warms , but i 'm not going to be patient enough for this beer to make it all the way to room temperature . alcohol asserts itself at the end of the sip . thick , rich and chewy ; very satisfying , this is a great wintertime beer and i 'll be putting up a few bottles for those january snow days with an extra log on the ire and time to kill . drinkability takes a shot because i 've had one and i 'm done for the night . pick up a four pack of these before they disappear ."

S"pour in a tulip glass from 22 oz bottle . appearance : extremely light coloured with a 1 '' head which dissipated quite quickly . aroma : slight aroma hops that also seemed to magically disappear . taste : extremely light beer ( abv 4.6 % ) , well carbonated , more malt than hops overall . a late bitterness on the back of the tongue . somewhat lingering metallic flavours which are quite annoying . blah . mouthfeel : very watery , seems typical for the asian lagers . drinkability : due to the lingering bitterness and beery aftertaste which both stayed for a good half-hour , it can be ruled out as a session beer . comments : too bad i did n't have any spicy , curry-ladened foods to go along with this beer , as the annoying bitter aftertaste would n't dissipate on it 's own . this was a gift , and i am glad that i did n't pay money for this beer ."

S'a beer i picked up at liquor loft and is now poured into an oversized wine glass . a nice deep black beer , but like with too many big stouts , this one lacks a substantial head . a nice roastiness comes through in the aroma , and a hint of coffee shows up as well . however it has bits of burnt coffee and worcestershire sauce in it as well . burnt coffee balanced by a nice sweetness . i want to like this beer , as i think lagunitas makes great beer , but it is hard to ignore the off flavors . the beer has a really nice sweet , roasty finsh ; the burnt flavor does not linger . creamy rich , mouthfeel . i may be able to finish this beer , the worcestershire and burnt coffee are faint enough to notice the beers other redeeming qualities .'

S"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass , an opaque black color with a thick 3/4 '' light brown head . the head subsides soon but retains a thin presence , leaving some lacing . the nose is subtle with a faintly unpleasant plastic-like smell and masked cocoa and molasses . the taste comes on aggressively potent , bitter , and moderately boozy , mellowing slightly into an espresso flavor and a little bit of very dark chocolate , like baking chocolate , with a somewhat unpleasant long-lasting bitter finish . it 's huge and oppressive , which is kind of admirable but a little wince-inducing , and it 's not very complex , mostly gigantic and bitter . as it warms the plastic smell leaves and it is a little less punishing on the palate but little else comes forward , maybe a little more roasty malt character . it has a pretty nice texture , a little viscous . not highly drinkable though , one is more than enough for me . i 'm wondering if i got a bad bottle or something , but the label says it 's good until 2014 . a formidable beer , and certainly a memorable one , but not my favorite . i like more richness and maltiness to my imperial stouts . i 'd be interested to try it after a few years of age , maybe it gets more enjoyable ."

S"brew dog 's sink the bismarck ! could easily be the hardest beer to review on ba . no , not really ; there are loads of beers with more complex flavors , aromas , textures , etc . but that 's not all that makes a beer hard to review . excessive price can have a greater effect than any of these . just read the opening of the wine trials . price correlates directly with taste , much of the time , and when an 11.5 oz bottle costs almost $ 100 , it can be a little difficult to be honest about your opinions . then , look at the abv . some quick research shows that this may well be the second most alcoholic beer in the world , and is almost certainly the second most alcoholic that 's available on a mass-market . and , since the most alcoholic beer was limited to a release of 12 bottles ( and 12 unfortunate rodents ) and costs another factor of 10 on top of the beer in question , for all intents and purposes , this is the most alcoholic beer you 're likely to come across . so , in sink the bismarck ! , you have a beer of absurd price and proof that 's relatively uncommon . for most beer advocates , this just screams a+ - world class . buuuutttt , then you actually taste the beer ... and the qualifications begin . `` but it 's so daring that , '' `` but it 's so unique that , '' `` but maybe if it were used as a mixer , it could , '' anyway , all of these are fair points , but dodge the actual subject of the beer itself . a : translucent golden color . incredibly smooth , highly viscous with essentially no carbonation . the syrupy quality of the pour sets off the alarm that this is not your usual brew . not an appetizing appearance , really . s : rotten farmhouse . emphasis on the hay that 's been in the sun too long , not on the manure . no , there 's no poop smell here . instead , just hops that have been shaped into a howitzer and fired at the whites of your eyes , fueled by alcohol ( it really hits you once you 're nose deep in the glass - yipes ! ) . t & m : not too different from the smell , really . there 's a bitterness or sourness that 's really unusual . round , not sharp as i usually find . it fills the mouth like sour milk , but really , it 's hop-oil . it 's allll just hop-oil . when i gave a friend a taste , she mentioned that it reminded her of the time she stole a taste of whiskey from her dad 's liquor cabinet"

S"2005 bottled - poured into a small cantillon tall snifter served at room temperature 330ml bottle , brown with a shiney silvery neck label on it , the main label states the name , facts and figures and the bottling date which in this case is 2005 . 14 % abv pours with a small off white almost yellowy head which soon disappears . rich coppery body with little ruby and maroon hints floating around the edges , no head once its settled down except for a tiny patch about half a centimetre sitting in the middle of the glass . thick syrupy body just clings to the side of the glass as you swirl it . smell , rich dry spicy malt ( very similar in character to alot of lagers ) , slight hint of corn and a tiny bit of dms . smooth alcoholic toffee and caramel , along with a little bit of sweet dried fruits like sultanas and raisins . spicy and aggressive estery alcoholic vapours , a strong enough whiff makes you feel slightly light headed with its potency . some slight butteriness coming through near the end , syrupy clovey warmth too taste , slight carbonation initally on the palette followed by a tonnes of very sweet sticky syrupy , alcoholic , caramelly malt , burnt sugars , raisins , figs , fresh plums . thick and fairly syrupy body , touch of maderia and a helping of nutty marzipan . some slight buttery character once again , along with a high degree of sugariness on the finish . lasting strong alcoholic warmth , warming vinous like quality , some slight bitterness on the finish , whether its some hop character of a huge whack of alcoholic maltiness burning the taste buds . some slight vanilla pod and light milk chocolate character in the main body of this beer , sits and moulds itself around the rest of the strong alcohol fruits and sweet caramel . the second time i 've sampled this beer , originally it was a 2003 and i was n't all that impressed . the beer seemed to be too sweet , too one dimensional in terms of flavour , and a little overwhelming as far as the alcohol character is concerned . it might be my palette developing or the year itself but i have come round to this beer . i still think that the sweetness is a little bit excessive and it could have perhaps benefited from some form of balancing but i suppose at the end of the day this is a malt monster , and a malty beer , especially a lager , brewed to 14 % is going to be pretty heavy on the sweetness . i definatly enjoyed this beer alot more this time , serving it at room temperature seems to bring out alot more depth in the flavour but it does push the alcohol to the forefront to some degree"

S"i first tried this beer at a cask ales festival . it blew me away then on how hoppy it was . so i picked up a 6 pack to see how it compared . appearance - good . white head , not too foamey , dissipates 'average ' speed . copperey-orange colour , clear with no haze . average carbonation . smell - yeah , thats hops all right ! ca n't really smell much else . taste - that hop flavour really jumps at you . you can taste the bitterness right at the start , and at the finish all you can taste in your mouth is the hops flavour . i can even 'feel ' the hops in my nose ! the malt , surprisingly , is still there i find . i figured with a beer this hoppy the malt would be far under-represented . not a bad balance . drinkability - i gave this a lower score because while its good beer , i ca n't see myself drinking too many of these in a row ! ! certainly not a beer to give to people hooked on 'football beer ' , for sure ."

S"big thanks to dave schuster for bringing this to our `` mini '' stout tasting on friday night . bottle is from 2007 and also says `` burns '' - does that mean this will burn ? at 18 % i suspect it might ... a - ... and we 've got a gusher . thank you kuhnhenn for high-quality bottling . once we got this under control we managed to collect most of it in a communal glass that we passed around . quick-dissipating dark mocha foam - no lace . pitch black with a hint of orange-red at the fringes when held to the light . s - dark roasted malt barley , sweet cream , caramel , molasses , a pinch of dark fruits . this is one very sweet and very boozy brew . there is a surprising hop presence as well - sort of pine-like . i 'm not sure how that 's possible , but it was there ! like most of my kuhnhenn experiences , it smelled wonderful . t - sour dark fruits , roast malt , dark chocolate , coffee with cream , and ( drum roll please ) alcohol ! reminded me of black albert after taking stanozolol . m - medium body , surprising carbonation generating a ton of tingling sensations . gritty and sticky , with lots of alcohol warmth . d - let 's see - high abv and carbonation . not the best combo here , as you end up stupidly drunk and bloated . the brew tastes quite good , but there 's no way anyone would drink two of these . this ( like many kuhnhenn brews ) is kind of a novelty . while i prefer kuhnhenn 's high-gravity beers to those of dogfish head , i can still only consume one in an evening ."

S"note -- a provisional review until warmer weather hits . pours somewhere between straw and gold with a nice white head that lasts . smells like a german pilsener . tastes like a german pilsener at first , but with a bit more malt and with a pleasing earthy taste . over time , it started tasting like o'douls non-alcoholic brew , which dropped the taste and drinkability scores considerably . fizzy mouthfeel -- the carbonation contributed to the early tastes positively , but once the o'doul 's tastes kicked in , the mouthfeel was reduced to fizz for me ."

S"750 ml bottle . this beer pours out a thickish looking deep purple . the bubbly head fades quickly . big raspberry aroma . syrupy raspberry flavor . the raspberries coat the mouth and becomes cloying . still , the flavor is not artificial , so although it 's a bit much , it 's still tasty . i do not find this beer to be very drinkable . one glass is plenty . as far as fruit beers go , this is pretty good , but it does not seem much like beer . i prefer the wisconsin belgian red ."

S"this is a beer that i 've actually had before the bottle i 'm reviewing , when i was recently on the west coast earlier in the spring . a friend told me to watch out for the hop stoopid , which was an amazing beer , and when i saw another entry in lagunitas ' `` sonoma farmhouse '' series , i was very intrigued . in the bottle out there , it was cheap and attractive , but i was left disappointed . especially in the massive lineups we were concocting out there , this beer did n't stand out and was even bland . perhaps trying this beer again in basically the same kind of company was a mistake ( part of a tasting that included several russian river and lost abbey beers ) , because the same thing happened . while this beer was pretty much a by-the-books saison , it does n't seem to make much sense to not even give this beer some kind of hops characteristic or impart some small signature that we have come to know and love lagunitas for . basically , this bomber is an orthodox , nice saison , that hits all of the right flavors on the nose but is disappointing overall -- mild , thin , bland in color and not complex . that being said , this is a killer summer beer that you could drink all day long , but it paled in comparison to some of the monsters we were grappling with ."

S"the bottle says it 's unfiltered , but i 'm confused ; this beer pours 99 % clear , bright gold into my glass . no haze to be found . hmm . on to the beer . a hard pour yields a brief , one-finger head with slight lacing . smells brightly of lemon , lime , wheat , and yeast . as it warms , i 'm coming up with a very faint vegetal note and a whiff of banana as well . still relatively cold , i get a short initial attack of hops that gives way to a very lightly spiced sweetness and a big burst of lemon . leaves my mouth and teeth squeaky . hmm . as it warms , astringency and hops come to the forefront ; the latter overshadows any sweetness . minor carbonation . closer to my experiences with ipas than i imagined . interesting ."

S'16.9 clear bottle with no freshness date . sunset orange hue with a good frothing and good retention . buttery , grainy , slight orange and mint and salty aroma . smooth carbonation with a medium body . a buttery musty diacetyl sticks to the palate , maltiness brings caramel and toasted biscuits . hops are a little bitter with a quick minty note . graininess and a flash of solvent alcohol show some roughness within this ale . finishes a little funky with alcohol on the breath . not bad , sure its english , bottle conditioned and all but it just does not seem to hit its stride . a bit of a chore to put down .'

S"bottle received in a trade with fatboyjim1 in a trade long ago . thanks , jim ! have had this one cellared for about a half a year . poured into a snifter . not sure the vintage of this as there is no stamp on the bottle . pours a jet black ; allows no light to penetrate . starts off with a huge creamy mocha head on top . good retention ; left some nice lace on the glass . scents of roasted malts and chocolate . a bit of drying scent in there , not sure what that is specifically . decent body on this beer . a tad crisp , but it still retains some creamy smoothness that i like in this style . alcohol is pretty well hidden in this beer . it 's not noticeable in the flavor at all . does n't taste `` hot . '' this is a really bland imp . stout . flavors of some mild cocoa , and finishes really charred and burnt . there is no sweet balance in this beer at all . there 's some hops there , but this is too roasted and grating . unbalanced and unpleasant . sorry , jim , but this beer fell short for me ."

S'poured to a light copper , with tiny carbonation bubbles throughout glass . had a medium off-white head that lingered thru much of the drink and then reduced to decent lacing on the sides of the glass . a nice mild aroma of sour fruit , mostly apples and grapes . taste was more of the same with some malty sweetness as well . some alcohol crept in at mid-glass , but surprisingly not too strongly , considering this is a 12 % abv . palate was a bit dry , but all and all , a good , tasty , enjoyable beer .'

S'ruddy bister hue , topped by a beige head that recedes into a lean , but steadfast layer . frothy , loose lace remains . the aroma is a combination of mellow cocoa and tepid , slightly tart lemon like citrus . floral hints arise as it breathes , but as a whole the aroma is understated and functional at best . the flavor is a facsimile of the nose . mild cocoa and citrus are prevalent , although an undertone of caramel sweetened , dark biscuit adds depth . hop bitterness is paltry and leaves ample , but inobtrusive residual sweetness . virtually bereft of esters , save a trace figgish complement . lightly bodied and conducive to easy quaffing . needs more dextrins to bolster the malt backbone . finishes squeaky clean , with only a ghostly hint of roasted barley . an innocuous , well crafted , albeit unimaginative brew . excellent drinkability , limited savorability .'

S"2007 vintage bottle bought at byron 's liquor store in oklahoma city . a very , very interesting beer . a new style for me but i 'm now hooked . this beer is truly legendary ! malty raisiny aroma . dark brown clear liquid . not much head . flavor is really interesting , unlike any beer i 've had before . there is a a strong tang that stands out . not exactly citrus , not exactly vinegar , it is just something different . maybe along the lines of a granny smith apple . ( actually it reminds me a little of some scrumpy cider i had recently ) strong alcoholic warmth . reminds me of a german dark wheat bread . raisins and port . definitely some port-like flavors . also reminds me of some of the belgian beers that are more tangy , sort of a more tangy version of chimay blue . nice mouthfeel . pretty full . drinkability i think depends on whether you like the tangyness of this beer . i do like it so i could drink several more . still the high abv probably makes this a a 2 beer max kind of session beer unless you want to get pretty lit up ."

S"pours pitch black with an astonishingly tall mocha coloured head reminiscent of the large foam bubbles you get from a cola . really , unusually large bubbles . laces well enough . the aroma is citrus hops and dark chocolate , licorice , roast , with the carbonation imparting a freshly cut unripe pear aspect to it . some espresso . the taste is a bitter burst of black licorice and chocolate with a minty , grassy lingering bitter finish . very roasty and bitter , with the same minty bitterness i find in great lakes ' miami weiss and canuck pale ale . i kind of wish they focused less on hop bitterness and more on hop flavor in all of these beers . i do n't know what they are doing to get this odd mintiness in them , but i for one am not a fan . it tastes like drinking an imperial stout right after having a halls mentho-lyptus . or brushing your teeth and rinsing with stout . or i do n't know . it 's not as unpleasant as i make it sound , but neither is it great . i 'm surprised i taste and feel the alcohol in a 6.5 % beer as much as i do . medium bodied with a good lift of carbonation . i applaud what great lakes are doing with project x , i just wish they 'd spend some time at three floyds , troegs , sierra nevada , russian river , etc , so that they might learn how to brew with hops in a way that is n't just all crass minty herbal bitterness . sorry . i know they 're local and the custom is to rave , applaud and inflate my opinion of their efforts ... .but i ca n't . i do n't know why i seem to be unimpressed by great lakes when so many others seem to be fans . but yeah . no . this needs work ."

S"thanks to moose3285 for dealing these my way , & for being a fine human being as well ! if there was a facebook group for `` rye beer fans '' i 'd be all over it . loved terrapin 's rye squared , so was looking forward to trapping this one in a glass . this beer is so drinkable i almost finished it before remembering i was sitting in front of a patiently waiting computer screen . the rye touch in this one is much lighter than the rye squared ( obviously , i guess ) , with a touch of spice . this brew is airy , rollicking , tart , & dry . so easy to drink . very good . i 'd recommend this one on drinkability alone , this would be a stellar session brew ."

S'so i am in new hampshire for the great bay half marathon ... its the night before a race and ... .why not drink some ... .ok ... .alot of the local beer ! ! ! the grand cru from portsmouth is good . this beer has was a pale hazy yellow in color with thin white head and decent lace . the nose on this beer is clovey and has a subtle lemony/citrus . this beer was light and crisp in taste dominated by clove ! the smell funnels into the taste of this beer . the heavy abv leads to this beer being a session killer ... certainly worth a taste .'

S"on tap and poured into oversized goblet . this is a beer that will do one of two things : blow your mind or make you sick . my review shows which end i fall on with this one . a : black as night , cappucino colored head that was thin and some lacing . had the look of the creamiest of chocolate milks , not a weak yoo hoo . n : good god , i smelled this coming out of the tap from about 4 feet away . the best smelling beer i have ever come across . it was all butterscotch and vanilla . phenomenal , 5.5 and as it warmed you could pick up some of the hops . how they escape i dont know but i can smell this all night and day . if they made it air freshener form , im hanging it in my car . t : whipped cream , vanilla , butterscotch , espcaping bitterness , powdered sugar , maple syrup . intensity bursting out of this one . as it warmed , it took on more vanilla than the raw sugars and was tremendous . i equate this one to drinking a milk shake flavored with chopped up vanilla charleston chews . fantastic . m : smoothness is there and dont understand how some claimed it to be thin- i thought the milk shake creaminess was like whipped cream . sweetness of baileys but more texture . d : sure its like a dessert , sure its like you need to eat it with a spoon , yet bizarrely drinkable . i probably couldnt drink them all night but i had no problem savoring the shiznit out of the goblet i got and am looking forward to picking up a large amount to put in the cellar . i have always like southern tier 's more mild beers and been back and forth on their imperials , but this freaking thing is pure genius . loved each and every delectible sip . not for the faint of heart ."

S"12oz bottle into duvel tulip . produced at stone . appearance : careful pour yields a 3 inch , pillowy white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving a few spots of lacing . pours a hazy yellow , and leaves one or two streaks of lacing . smell : the rosemary , sage , and thyme dominate the nose , along with some very distinct belgian saison notes , maybe some lemon , and peppermint . really nice and really deep . the explosion of herbal notes is almost perfume-like , but there 's a strong earthiness to the aroma . also some tobacco smell . probably could pick out random smells and list them for quite awhile with this one . i 'm teetering between 4.0 and 4.5 for smell here . i 'm a sucker for a beer that gives me a different , interesting smell every time i put my nose to the glass . at the same time , not all of these smells are saying `` hey , drink me ! '' and some of them are pretty discordant with each other . taste : entirely dominated by parsley . i 'm kidding , and now you know that my beer review writing is humorless . i can not taste parsley , and the rosemary , sage , and thyme are a bit more in the background too , but their influence is felt . lots of herb and spice flavor , but also a strong hit of citrus hops and a soapy finish . the flavors are rather savory , an impression that is augmented by the fullness of the mouthfeel . this beer is dying for an expert food pairing ( unfortunately , i am not the expert to suggest one ) . it 's looking for just the right match to catapult its taste score to a 5.0 and unlock the hidden potential of some dish or other . would probably also work great in a sauce or a marinade . i like this beer , and it 's nice and refreshing like a saison should be . the building soapiness and bitterness in the finish are the major aspects that hold it back from a score higher than a 4.0 . also , while the taste is rather beautiful , it 's not quite as complex as the aroma would lead you to expect . to put it all another way , my first sip made me say , `` oh ho , there it is ; these guys know what they 're doing . saisons are fluid styles , and this experiment is working . '' a lot of other sips followed suit ; enough to ( along with being pretty impressed with the character of a lot of those sips , the amount of flavors provided , the level of refreshment achieved ) push this beer up to a 4.0 in taste . however , a non-negligible amount of"

S"bottled as obama '08 presidential ale what can we do to support our president to heal our battered nation ? we can go into the forests and rescue endangered species . we can volunteer to distribute medical supplies and care for those who have no health insurance . we can mentor orphan children . i have taken it upon myself to support the president in his quest , by doing something i do well . i will drink his beer . it 's a fine brew , but a nagging question tugs at me as i drink it . does this brew resemble our president ? well , our president looks good . this brew looks good in my tulip . a golden yellow with a thick , foamy white head and plenty of sheeting action on the glass . odd that our first african-american president be honored with such a pale looking beer . i have never smelled the president . i suspect he does not smell of faint malt and a little grassy hops . the flavor was light malt with slightly fruity and grassy hops , well balanced , for sure , but the flavor was rather light . there was a little sweetness as the brew warmed . does obama gets sweeter as he warms up ? only the first lady knows for sure . obama is a pretty smooth talker , and this is a pretty smooth tasting brew . but for all the sweeping change obama is calling for , and must make , this was one of the most straightforward , safe , and unoffensive brews i 've ever had . would n't a beer befitting of our president take some risks ? shake things up a bit ? challenge us in some way ? this beer falls way short in that department . i 'll be happy to toast our president , but i plan to do it with a beer more representative of his character , which this brew is not ."

S"a- this has an impressive copperish/honey color that poured with an initial foamy head that dissapears rather quickly into not really even a complete thin ring around the glass ... .oh well i guess . i think that it has a rather clean looking appearance which is n't a bad thing , just nothing substantial . s- i really liked the mild brown sugar aromas , and has maybe even a slight floral smell , but overall this is very pleasant . i like the fact that this beer has something other than the grainy `` beer '' smell that plagues so many of the brews that i drink on a more regular basis , quite a pleasure . t- again , i think that this has a lot of what the label says . it 's definately smooth , with a moderate honey character to it . what i really like about this , is what i consider to be the decently hopped finish ... .you really know that with all the flavor and decent bitterness that you 've tried something worthy of being called a craft beer . m- unfortunately , i was n't overly impressed with how this felt on the palate . i was expecting something that felt like i had a full beverage but this leans slightly more towards the watery side of things . i will say that it feels more filling than many other beers i 've had , but i guess i was expecting something more . i do like the moderate to mild carbonation that comes with drinking this ale . d- i do n't think i 'd fill up on these during a sitting but nonetheless , i 'd have a couple after a long days ' work ! i would probably put this into the top 3 honey ales that i 've tried to date and do recommend anybody to give this a whirl ... it offers more than say what sleemans honey brown has to it . i will definately purchase this in the future when and where i can find it , as i have n't seen this in many places during my travels ."

S"served in a tumbler . the label on this thing is stamped batch 20 . whatever that means . it pours a clear topaz topped by a finger of lightly off-white foam . the nose comprises straight flaky biscuit , with a touch of caramel , honey , light grass , and mild flowers . something peanut-brittle-y comes to mind . the taste does n't do anybody any favors , either : buttery caramel , buttery biscuits , something akin to buttery popcorn ( did i mention i got a tad bit of butter in this beer ? ) , and a stiff yet understated ( yeah , wrap your minds around that one ... my tongue did ... ) backbone of menthol , which bolts through the sea of malt every now and again . nothing about this is right . the body is a light moderate , with a very light moderate carbonation and a somehow skinnily syrupy feel . overall , this was an absolute mess of a beer . i almost hope it was old or a bad bottle or something , 'cause the grimace that crossed my face after sipping it lasted for several grueling minutes to follow . bad times ."

S"drinking from a bottle . the beer appears very clear with a coppery red color . very transparent with only a mild haze . there is little head and what there is dissipates quickly . the aroma is intense , almost like a powerful soy sauce . my first thoughts were of grapes and raisins . wow . the first taste hits like a brick . this beer packs in a solid , thick flavor of raisins . for a 20 % beer , this is drinkable , though certainly not a lightweight . the mouthfeel is a little thin due to low carbonation , but there is a dramatic sweetness in this one that does not fade . correct me if i am wrong , but this could pass for a sweet cognac . this is a very good beer . i really enjoy the regular raison d'etre and this is a step up in some ways , but not for any more than one or two . somehow , i think there is a complexity lacking in this beer that is present in the d'etre version . perhaps the dominance of raisins is a little too overpowering here , but not unwelcome . i 'd like to keep saying that it tastes like oak , or nuts , or something different , but raisins keep jumping out at me ."

S"12oz bottle into a ccb snifter . a - pours a very dark brown , almost black . sizable khaki-colored head , with decent retention , recedes into a patchy cap with great lacing . s - ba labels this as a black ipa , but the huge sweetness from the honey pushes this in a different direction . lots of brown sugar and toffee , and a bitterness that seems more from the roasted malt than from the hops . t - tale of two beers . cold , it 's very sweet and cloying , and more like a cross between an old ale and a barleywine . as it warms , the bitterness starts to shine through , and it begins to round the flavor out . caramel and coffee , and some floral hoppiness . a bit of heat from the alcohol . different but very nice . m - like almost all ccb beers , the mouthfeel is spot-on . consistent fine carbonation gives it just the right amount of bite , and it has a long dry finish . d - i 'm halfway through the pair ( including or ) and i 'm starting to feel it , but i 'm definitely going to get through the other . the abv is fairly high and not especially well-hidden . o - this would be a nice special-occasion beer . price is a bit high but it 's a one-off . glad i got an opportunity to try it . now i 'm interested to see what or is like ."

S'dark gold or light amber in color ; crystal clear . good , lasting head . nearly no lace . musky aroma . obviously more malty , but still has a sweaty smell . not attractive . reminds me of chicken soup in terms of flavor . the mustiness comes through in the flavor . one positive is the full bodied presence of the malt , although the carbonation comes across as lighter than expected . the aftertaste becomes sour as time passes . not a complete miss , but definitely funky flavor wise in a less attractive way .'

S'appearance : i poured this black opaque beer into my duvel tulip glass , leaving plenty of room for its thick , tan chunky head . smell : a rich and potent smelling beer ; full of roast - barley and coffee - sweet notes of fruit and molasses , and finished with some heat and esters , all while cascade hops mingle in and out . taste : full flavored ; sweetness up front - figs and molasses - followed by a hop bitterness , leaving your mouth full of bakers chocolate and alcohol . as it warms , it opens up more yeast esters with vanilla and raisins/figs . there is a good amount of floral hops mixed in , especially on the finish . mouthfeel : medium bodied and smooth ; creamy with nicely carbonated . drinkability : low to medium ; this is a sipping beer . a 750 is a little tough to get through alone , but manageable . in cooler weather , it would have been even easier . notes : i bought this the second i saw it was for sale ; i enjoyed the 30th anniversary bock , and was really looking forward to this beer . it was really good , a classic sierra nevada brew . interesting barleywine ; i would love to try this with 1-3 years on it . if i see another bottle for sale , i will have to snag it to age it - at 10.2 % alcohol , it can stand up to the test of time . now if i could just get my hands on their 30th anniversary stout ...'

S"the appearance is lacking a bit with almost no head and a very weak lacing , the color is clear and brown to copper . smell is very malty and sour , but with hints of syrapy nuttiness in the backround . taste is very sour , then it has a honey flavor to it . it seems this bottle is old , but the original must 've been mouth watering good . mouthfeel is ok , with a little smoothness and carbonation that finishes with a little flavor in your mouth . i would love to find a fresher bottle and see how this was supposed to turn out , because it is seemingly great before time and weather get to it ."

S"a : bright gold color hints of orange , completely crystal clear , typical for a filtered beer but not really my cup of tea . a perfectly white foam head appears , and than runs for cover quickly . s : beautiful west coast hop aroma with a hint of honey and caramelized malts . t : this beer really tastes more like any ipa than a pale ale . the hops tend to dominate with a bitter-lemon flavor coming through . to be honest i would guess this brew to be between 6 % -7 % abv but really its not even close , 4.6 % , odd . m : not that impressed , i guess i enjoy unfiltered so much more these days that all other beers seem to have the uneventful texture of water . d : i did n't have to much issue with the drinkability of this beer , however i like stronger ales , for its low 4.6 % abv i would say its not that easy a drink ."

S"headline : g.w.b finds a beer from mad anthony he can not only drink , but thoroughly enjoy ! i was very pleasantly surprised to see an ipa on tap on my regular jaunt to the brewpub for monday night $ 1 pint night . needless to say , i ordered quite a few . but a small caveot emptor : mad anthony is known for fiery post-session torment , and this ipa was no different . after only a few pints , i woke up with a fierce headache that lasted through most of my workday . ugh . monday drinking = bad . a gorgeous bleached 2 '' head greets my eager palate , which will subside to about 1/2 '' . the color is like weathered pennies . a strong lace will be the only external proof of the beers existence in my tumbler . the nose is almost abrasively hopped . the beer just screams centennials . they almost milked out apricot and grapefruit tones with the hops , but the malts were just not there to fully enclose and amplify the flavors . this resulted in an overwhelming bitterness but a fantastic hop burp . at about this point i realized that this beer is very similar , if not a clone of , dfh 's 60 minute , less the harsh medicinal quality that beer often has . there 's a bit of a weird chalky middle taste , sandwiched between the hop rush and the bitter smack at the end . the mouthfeel is pretty thin for the high alcohol , but this beer is fucking poundable for an ipa . a damn fine effort from the folks at mabc ."

S"this is , indeed , a beer fit for a king as the name suggests . it poured from a 750 ml bottle into my goblet a chestnut colour with a bubbly , compact one-finger head that formed a creamy ring . the brown colour was only slightly tinged with some ruby highlights , though not so much to make it resemble cola . underneath a dominant alcoholic aroma laid a complex mix of sweet brown sugar , powdery yeast , cinnamon and a medicinal smell not unlike cherry cough syrup . on the palate , the sugar flavour took on a burnt , carmelized character . also bubblegum and more sweetness from a syrupy port taste . spice , too , with some cinnamon and nutmeg flavours . overall , very sweet like a tripel and only the slightest alcoholic burn amazing for 11 per cent abv . tiny bubbles let you know the carbonation is there , but they did n't break up the smooth , easy-drinking texture . i downgraded the drinkability slightly only because i found the sweetness a bit overbearing after awhile ."

S'pours clear yellow in color with bubbles racing it , and it had a 1 finger white head that faded quickly ; basically no lacing . smells of malt , grains , corn , caramel and some light floral hops ; pretty light and basic nose that borders on dull . tastes like a typical american lager with sweet malt , grains , corn , caramel , light floral hops , herbs or grass and maybe some faint citrus ; basically a lager - not anything special . mouthfeel is light , crisp and easy to drink , with mild carbonation and an almost watery feel ; this flowed down like water and was highly drinkable . a great session beer , just very ordinary in the flavor dept - all that ba advertising paid off since i tried it ... too bad i was disappointed since it was just so regular .'

S'this is one of those beers i make sure to keep in my fridge at all times . to me this is great with food or on its own , summer or winter . appearance : dark , dark color with a frothy off-white head . definitely carbonated . smell : nice hints of chocolate , caramel , maybe a little coffee ? taste : well balanced . you would think that from the smell it would be too much but definitely not an over-bearing beer . mouthfeel : smooth . funny , because at first glance people tend to think this is like drinking mud but thanks to the carbonation and balance very , very smooth and easy to drink . drinkability : i think i just answered that ... . hands-down my favorite stout . cheers'

S"draft pour into an 8 oz . goblet at whole foods . a : slightly hazy , light amber color with one finger of off-white foam head . abundant lacing remains on the glass . s : intense over-ripe tropical fruit alongside some relatively tame citrus . overall impression is very sweet , with no alcohol detectable . t : begins with dry toasted malt that is soon joined by very spicy and floral hop aromatics . between the prominent malt and spicy hops , an unexpected presence of umami is sensed , although sweetness does build as moderate bitterness arrives , making for a rounded finish . no alcohol is detectable in the flavor . m : moderate viscosity with light carbonation . this beer is sticky on the palate , but not excessively so , which fits the style well . d : this beer is a huge double ipa whose origins and wide distribution may be serve as a more accessible stand-in for russian river 's elusive pliny the younger . while both beers are rich enough to earn the 'triple ipa ' descriptor in certain company , gubna strains the palate over time with its aggressive flavors . a closer , more appropriate comparison for this beer is alpine 's equally challenging exponential hoppiness ."

S"appearance : this one 's a nice looking bronze color with a touch of red to it . there 's some chunky debris floating around that makes it interesting . the head is quite a sight . it 's a full three fingers deep and is vanilla colored . retention was excellent and waves of lace clung to the glass . smell : the nose is very citrusy and sweet up front . it features grapefruit , pineapple , and orange . hops soon follow and are citric and piney . pretty standard for sierra nevada . let me guess ... cascade ? there 's a decent bit of malt in there . smells like a mix of pale and caramel . but , it definitely takes a backseat to the citrus and hop aromas . smells slightly biscuity on the tail . taste : the citrus flavors are sweet and apparent on the first sip . it 's indeed grapefruit , pineapple , and orange . they 're not quite as strong in taste as in smell though . hops are clearly the primary feature . very nice bitter flavor that is citric and piney . it 's a nice jolt to the palate . the malts add some sweetness , but are pounded into submission by the hops . it 's got a great , bitter flavor . it is a little biscuity , but finishes up dry and bitter . mouthfeel/drinkability : it 's medium bodied and is very smooth . carbonation is active enough to give it crisp bit , but does n't negate the smooth feel . really well done . drinkability is off the charts . i could drink this all night and then some . it goes down really easy and abv is right on target for kicking back with a few . sierra nevada 's got another winner with this one . they really do n't know how to make a bad beer . i really wish they 'd make this or celebration a year round release . perhaps i appreciate more as it is . either way , this is really nice beer . worth seeking out ."

S"it 's taken just a couple months for this beer to go from completely obscure to downright ubiquitous in southern maryland . welcome to familiarity , ranger . 22oz bomber poured into my old faithful beer mug . a : the pale golden color does n't stand out from other pales ... but the head on this was particularly sexy , leaving a shitload of lace and having a certain fluffiness to it that i can appreciate . s : as you 'd expect , the nw hops are what 's dominant on the nose ... but pay attention , and you 'll notice a bit of sour notes alongside the malts ... perhaps the belgian influence coming through ? this is no belgian-style ipa by any means ( go drink belgo if that 's what you want ) ... but it has hints of it in both the nose and the taste buds . t : exactly what you 'd expect , bittering hops dominate the flavor ( with some pine , slight onion notes , and a hint of astringency ) , but never make it a chore to drink . there is some noticeable maltiness to the beer at first , but i ca n't call it balanced , either . for whatever reason , the 12oz bottle seems to have more of a malt and sour-ish yeast presence to it . m : again , it 's what you 'd expect , light but not too watery , but not a lot of carbonation . o : $ 4 for a bomber ? that is value , my friends ( well , value by bomber standards ... ) i 'm a huge stickler for value , and in my opinion , a low price can turn a decent beer into a great one . that 's pretty much the case with ranger . well priced and good quality ."

S"chilled bottle into a glass . i made the 4-hour ( one-way ) pilgrimage to north coast to pick this up , and got into an accident on the way . this greatly soured my mood , but i had one anyway . let 's see . a : pitch black with mahogany highlights . 1 finger of tan head that recedes to half a finger and remains there for the drink , with thick lacing down the side of the glass . s : if you did n't know it was aged in bourbon barrels , the smell would tell you . strong bourbon and vanilla flavors in the nose , with chocolate and roasted malt rounding out the bouquet . the alcohol sting is unmistakable , and detracts from the smoothness . t : a rich and complex mix of bourbon , vanillla , wood , roasted malt , and chocolate . these sweet flavors are combated by a pronounced bitterness that fights for attention throughout the entire taste . however , the bourbon flavor definitely tips it to the sweeter end , and my feeling is that the taste would improve with a year of bottle aging . the alcohol is pronounced and unapologetic . m : active carbonation , perhaps more than the standard old rasputin if i remember correctly . not as sticky as i would expect , and more medium bodied than full . enjoyable to the palate . kind of hot . d : these are n't cheap drinking , and they were made in limited quantities . i enjoy them but i will not be slamming these back . i will definitely be a future customer of the bourbon barrel-aged series , however . ( edit : after learning that these now cost $ 20 instead of the $ 13 i paid , i had to lower the drinkability . look , a $ 20 pint is just insane . this beer is good , but not that good . )"

S"very nice amber color to this . sticky head , almost looks sugary . the smell is full of pine , very strong pine . think pinesol and you are awfully close . the taste follows the smell very closely . it 's a knockout combo of in your face hop pine and subtle malt . not balanced at all , but that is a good thing in this case . mouthfeel is nice and sticky . average drinkability due to high abv and hop profile ."

S"there is n't much to be said about this beer that has n't been said about the other macro american adjunct lagers . it 's piss colored yellow , it 's watered down and over-carbonated . and above all it 's made by a huge beer corporation targeting your typically sloppy drunk american . but , if i were to choose out of the bmc , this would be it . it has more flavor than budweiser or miller high life . it 's crisp and refreshing . it 's a satisfactory , cheap beer that 's great to drink at summer cookouts ."

S"a- poured a heavy amber color cloudy with stuff floating around . extremely foamy . s- a weird clove hint . kinda reminds me of dark horse 's trip ale . t- to much going on i do n't know where to begin . i taste the hops but also a weird wood flavor . has a sour aftertaste . m- light bodied . low carbonation . prolly the best quality of this beer . d- i 'm just gon na say i 'm glad i only have a 750ml bottle of this which will be the last time i drink . overall- i know jolly pump-a-dump keeps their beers aged in oak barrels or whatever but i 'm good . maybe the high price and the big `` differences '' get people to think they 're sophisticated or something ? ? i get why brewers try to go all crazy by adding different stuff or brewing in some different way which usually does n't work out . and if it does it 's a rarity that should be honored . this whole company reminds me of the south park episode `` smug '' about the people in san francisco who smell their own farts . please do n't think of me as a `` bud guy '' but i would take a stone ipa or something just in the ballpark ."

S"presentation : poured from a 12 oz . bottle from teh winter variety pack into a snifter glass . appearance is dark brown , almost black , with ruby edges . not much head , but keeps a slight tan lacing around the ring of the glass throughout drinking . smell is weak malt and cherries . taste follows the same path . the malt is surprising effective , but this brew is just too watery overall . the cherries are pleasant but not always there and also weak . mouthfeel is medium bodied with not a lot of carbonation . drinkability is good . there is low abv and weak flavors , but it is just not a good sour . overall , a below average sour with the malt really being the standout . i did n't love or hate it . a good attempt but needs work ."

S'pours a light yellow with a mild greenish tint . not much head but some lacing . there is so much lemongrass in the scent . the flavor reminds me of lemon and mild oregano . the flavor is very wheat filled followed by subdued lemon and grassiness . the malt backbone is substantial lending a good flavor . the mouthfeel is light but the aftertaste is mildly dry and satisfying . this is a very drinkable beer and is very enjoyable to drink . very session worthy .'

S"before i start i should say i 'm trying to find a bottled on date because i suspect this may not be the freshest . pours clear and copper with thick , 2 finger , white head . smell is terrible . i do get some intense piney/spruce hops and touch of caramel , i 'm overwhelmed by a skunky smell . i really cant put my finger on it , but its not nice . taste wasnt bad , but again i hope this was a bad batch . it had some nice hop bitterness , with a touch of citrus , and it had a good malt backbone , more of a dryer malt . but still , something just a little off . mouthfeel was fine , but a less than appealing aftertaste left behind . overall not the best . i bought a 6 pack and took me about 10 days to drink all of them , trust me ... thats not normal . i kept a bottle to see if i can find a freshness date and will certainly re-review if i did get a bad bottle ."

S"this brew is a slightly hazy , straw gold color . nice sized white head floats above . light malt on the nose with a touch of hops . mostly light malt on the taste , a nice kiss of floral hops . very refreshing brew . too bad they do n't offer these in six packs around here , you could put down quite a few of these on a nice summer day ."

S"22 oz . into duvel tulip ... pours a thick espresso-dark body with thick bready head and moderate lacing . head goes somewhat quickly . moderate carbonation . ample but subtle sweetness on the nose - a little wine characteristic - from carbonation emerges a little champagne - not a huge amount of roasted malt character . not what we 're looking for in an imperial stout but so far interesting nonetheless . very austere ... can feel the grain but not the roast . quite alcoholic and thin but with a white winey character ... chardonnay ? only a bit of slate roasted malt at first but starting to come out with warmth . still mild . spiced apples emerge , too . not getting much of any hops . finish is a bit astringent with the dry white wine character . a little slate . not much malt . quite austere for an impy . it 's light enough to drink but does n't bring about the desired flavor profile . rather aastringent , a bit winey with light chocolate/roasted malt ( finally ! ) . not entirely unpleasant but definitely not what we 're looking for with the style . recent threads about brewery qc issues make me wonder . looks like an impy but sure tastes like something a bit different . by no means horrible just definitely not true to style . the label , on the other hand , is quite informative and entertaining on at least some level . best of wishes to the brewery for resolution of their qc issues which were so graciously addressed in this forum ."

S'pours a nice looking golden amber . lace stays on the sides . pours a little head with not much carbonation staying . smell is very winter . sweet spices ( nutmeg , allspice ) followed by some pine and then a sweet roasted malt at the end . taste is sweet and then really malty . nice dark roasted malt give it a deep roasted taste with lots of sweet and spice at the end . mouthfeel was a little lacking . very creamy at first but fades almost instantly . could have been better . drinkability is so-so . if it was christmas eve then maybe but not an all day beer .'

S"my second time having this . shared by a local ba on 09.23.2010 . jet black with one of the meanest chamiosee colored head i 've seen . there 's nothing less exciting than talking about the color brown , but this is one heck of a dark brown . the bottle was shaken the day before to maximize the chile presence . cocoa powder , bittersweet chocolate , and chilies dominate . i think what 's most absent , actually , is the coffee . the cinnamon , while faded , still provides some nice balance to the cocoa , and the peppers come through on the finish with a warming kick . thick and chewy , hunahpu 's delivers . as much as i dislike reading the description of this because of how over the top it sounds , this is a great stout . it 's not hot , but i think it 'd be hard to drink a lot of this . so split it . with me . ( i 'll also note that for me , this is a case where i can say that this is a great-looking and tasting beer , but the drinkability is low , and i doubt i 'll actively seek it out . it just has a lot going on and the sum of its parts fails to live up to its individual elements . )"

S'i hate to write bad posts , especially since i am new , but this beer is horrible . i do not understand how people can drink this beer . it has a very sharp , bitter , sour taste , with no real redeeming qualities . a : it has a common pour from this style of beer . s : i knew it was not going to be pleasant , too many conflicting textures . t : i could barely make it thru a bottle . i would say i had this 5 years ago , but it has burned a horrible memory in my mind . m : quite pungent . d : i refuse this beer whenever it is offered . i would rather go sober than drink this beer again .'

S'a good beer for : mowing the lawn ; fishing on a hot summer day ; tailgating ; 4th of july picnics ; family reunions ; curing hangovers ; and for when you are laid off from your job . i admire the consistency in these brews , an art in itself to produce a completely consistent beer batch after batch . if you are going to the game , and expect to drink lots of beer , snag a 30 pack for , say 14 bucks , and life is good . make memories while you can .'

S"12 oz . bottle . pours a nice cloudy golden color . thick white head stayed around for a fair amount of time . some bubbles coming from the bottom , but not as many as i might expect . slight fruity smell , but also sort of grainy . refreshing , slightly sour . did n't really have the banana esthery flavor typical of a good hefeweizen . light body , but not the carbonation that i would expect . this is n't a bad beer , but does n't seem to fit the ideal characteristics of a great hefeweizen . still probably worth a try ."

S"the stout itself was black enough to block out the sun , if i were to pick a color it would have to be total eclipse . wafting from the espresso foam head was a delectably sweet aroma of malty chocolate and almond with some charred coffee going on to . it was a very complex nose , and i 'm sure i have missed some of it , so feel free to drop us a line and let us know what you thought . as alluring as the smell was , it did n't compare to the rounded , balanced taste of the bolshoi . the blitz of sweet booze opened up into a garden of bitter bakers chocolate , heavily roasted coffee , and some berry/cherry flavor . it had a smooth , heavy mouth feel , but totally pleasant ."
